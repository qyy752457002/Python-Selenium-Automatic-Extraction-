Not many sides about it.\nHowever, it becomes a lot less fun when you realize the game isnt balanced, and you have to do that yourself.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that:\n1. The characters were not tweaked, and arent equally good (example, zip is not fast enough with his ability to make an actual difference. Basically useless). Devs need to make the character more even. Not making them worse, but making the bad characters better and the good characters the same (good characters are chunk and Doug). Another detail is that the player count doesnt change the game to balance it. The tree will basically always lose if there is more than 3 players, and the squirrels have a pretty hard time with 2 unless you work well together. Id appreciate a change in map choice, power up amount, or character power when the player count is higher or lower. This would almost infinitely make this game better.\n\n2. Also, there is very little customization. The fact that you cant choose the map, and that you cant customize your experience beyond a minimal level makes the game a lot less fun to play.\n\nAnd with that, my final remarks. The game is pretty good, and highly suggest it if you like to share your headset with friends or family. However, this game is pretty surface level and gets a little boring without fun people to play with. So, devs, I like this game enough that if you balance this game even a little bit, I will be glad to support it strongly.\nThanks for reading.\n\nHelpful | 107\nDeveloper ResponseJun 3 at 12:36 AM\n\nHello TinyTexan! Great feedback on balancing. We're definitely saving this so we can take it into consideration. We can't promise that this will happen, but hopefully the game will be even more enjoyable in the future. :)", "Doofus317Jul 7 at 10:16 PM\nBeautiful game\n\nOne of the only VR games that involves the entire room. Everyone can play some role and it always gets intense. Some reviews say its hard for the tree to win if there is more than 3 squirrels but Ive found that you can get quite good at the tree and handle up to 6 and depending on the map maybe all 8. Make sure you have a chrome cast for this game so others can watch the tree beat up squirrels :)\n\nHelpful | 15", "Hurcules_061513 days ago\nPlease\n\nSo listen I want to ask a favor can you please get at least something like Pokmon I will pay hundreds for it so please Ill do anything to get it\n\nHelpful | 2", "Sludgycomb40045Jul 11 at 1:29 PM\nBUY IT NOW\n\nI bought Acron 4 days ago I think and my friends and have played for hours on end each day. The gameplay is simple yet leaves room for so much strategy, and there many secrets hidden that can really change the the tide if the game, especially for the tree.\n\nHonestly, the only real problem I find with the game is that there arent many options when In comes to customizing your experience. We dont need a stage builder or anything but the ability to change the number or acorns needed or the time limit would be cool.\n\nMore squirrels would be cool too, such as a Sugar glider that can jump high and glide when in the air, a squirrel that can throw the other squirrels, or a squirrel that in decently fast and can run over water and go through Sap fine. I dont know, just thought those would be cool.\n\nDespite the lack of customization options and only 4 squirrels, this game still gets an easy 5/5\n\nHelpful | 3", "Ommmm_2486Jun 28 at 11:30 AM\nFirst VR game my kids love\n\nThis is the first time that my kids really enjoyed a VR game. We had fun playing together with their friends, even those in other cities, switching back and forth as the tree. Reduces the eye fatigue of wearing The Quest too long. Plus, it includes mobile devices, which my kids already know how to use. However, after about a week, they lost interest. For the developers, my kids had some suggestions. They would like to see updates with different worlds. This is common for other game platforms they play like Roblox. Also, they would like to see new characters, maybe a flying squirrel and a rabbit who can jump. When they use their mobile devices, they would like to be able to change the perspective, like zooming in or out, side to side and above. Great work on this game!\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJun 29 at 5:37 AM\n\nThank you for the feedback! We're saving the kids' suggestions so we can keep them in mind for any future development.

The squirrels table significantly more attention to detail and teamwork to have a chance at winning. The tree can reach any part of the map with a weapon, if you try. With that in mind, the balance of play is largely based on the number of squirrels in my opinion, until devs introduce balancing controls.

HOWEVER, me and my friends have played this more times than we can count, and we have compiled a list of what we think would make this game ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS. First: map selection. If the tree could make a playlist of maps instead of random that would be awesome. Zip should be able to move through sap while using the boost. Chunk, himself, should be able to take two hits without KOing, Sim shouldnt run out of bridges (he does sometimes) and the tree shouldnt be able to grab squirrels from Dougs tunnels. Add another squirrel or two and maybe some customization of the trees weapons and boom. I would pay a LOT more if these features were added.

I've only tried it with 3 squirrels, so maybe it's better with more, but it seems like it's just too easy for the tree, even when aim assist is off.\n\n2. The controls are a little weird for squirrels. My family was confused about all the buttons, so they never really got into the game.

Played for 3 hours solid.\nRight when they figured out how to play, it was quite hilarious watching their techniques evolve. 3 builders and a digger was the hardest combo to beat.\n\nWhen I finally let my niece play the tree and I played a squirrel I did notice that there are indeed balance issues between squirrels.

Typically we let someone be the tree for several in a row then switch.\n\nOn the device side: alot arent supported. For example my kids have fire tablets or hand me down ipads. It works on neither. Id recommend downloading and launching the mobile app on your devices before buying to make sure you are going to have enough.\n\nI downloaded nox andriod emulator for the couple pcs in my house and the kids cam use those to run the mobile app. Its strange there isnt a pc version of the squirel client. But this is a good substitute with minimal control mapping (wsad).\n\nBetween that and a couple phones we can run up to 4 squirrels. 3-4 seems to be enough to make it challenging for the tree. The bots do cause a little distraction but often carry the acorn the wrong way negating the progress made. So generally its annoying if they have an acorn.\n\nThere is also an aim assist option and you can turn off name tags for the tree. This makes it a bit harder. We tend to leave the aim assist on for the young ones.\n\nHelpful | 0", "julian.johnson.72Jul 21 at 2:17 PM\nFun multiplayer game\n\nFun game for the family being able to take it turns on the Oculus.

And we invited friends over twice to play it (9 people total). Every time was a blast! It's fun being both a squirrel and the tree. (Though I think it's more fun to be the tree.)\nThe levels are interesting and challenging. Mixing that with the squirrels abilities adds a good strategic element. We have found that some levels are much harder for the squirrels than other levels, so it's a little tricky to figure out when to take turns as the tree so everyone gets a fair chance.\nOne struggle we've had with it is when you're the squirrel and you have a acorn, running back to the base is very hard because the camera continues to face forward, so you can't see where you're running. There are arrows to help, but sometimes we end up running off a cliff or into an obstacle that shouldn't have happened. It would be better if, as a squirrel, I was able to adjust the camera angle. Even a first person mode might be fun, and make me feel more \"in\" the game.\nBut overall, it's a fantastic game to play with friends, and I would love to see more variations on this theme. I don't just mean new levels, but new games where one person is in the vr headset and the rest on other devices. But other themes could be preventing alien attacks, or defending a castle, although I admit the squirrel/tree idea is really fun and creative and good for all ages.

We got into it again last night and hated it. Playing on my pixel 3xl and my wife on an ipad both thought it was so painful we tried to talk him into another game (my son loved it as long as he was the tree). The squirrels felt extremely slow and had no maneuverability so we couldn't get close to the tree without adding 2 AI squirrels which is dumb. Even then game play was so miserable it took all our patience to stay in there and let him play a while.\n- always facing the tree with tiny FOV had us constantly falling off the world or in the water or into a ball simply sitting there in your way while returning to the flag. We couldn't tell where we were going at all\n- the tree just grabs and throws us off the world with shield, tunnel etc.. being useless\n- one map I fell off the world after spawning several times, in others fell and got stuck where I had to get killed to respawn\n- the large balls when not rolling n killing you from not seeing where your going, they blocked tunnels, bridges, and the flag itself making levels essentially unplayable\n- the shield kept sticking in the ground leaving him exposed, while hiding in bushes balls would roll from behind and touch the bush (not squirrel) and kill them\n\nThey've added a few mostly lazy maps but a ton of monetization and have a totally unbalanced game at this point.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 2:00 AM\n\nThank you for taking the time to let us know what you think.

Was incredibly fun to play but the balance seems off. When it was 3 or fewer squirrels it was super easy for the tree. When it was 5 or more squirrels it was almost unfair for the tree. So 4 or 5 seemed to be a good balance. There needs to be like added perks or something for fewer squirrels or less frequent objects for the tree.

If the paid skins dont sell too well maybe just add more free unlock able ones.\n\nEdit: Also just keep making more maps (preferably more crazy ones with cool gimmicks)\n\nEdit 2: Oh make it easier for squirrels to approach the tree.

Also, the green sticky stuff should not be allowed within a certain proximity of the tree or it should slow down the tree too if put that close. Tree is virtually impossible to beat with two players when the green sap is all around the acorns.

While I do wish there were some more customizable options across the board, and more accessibility/characters, this game is the most fun you can have with up to 8 other friends on a quest.\n\nMy main concern is that after a while the lack of choices bogs things down. Personally I would add the ability to vote on a map, a couple more things for the tree to throw that could be interchangeable with the slime ball (maybe like a bomb that explodes after a set interval, or a water balloon that could have an area of effect which temporarily makes a puddle that squirrels could drown in). Other than that some simple balance changes like lower cooldowns for squirrels when theres less squirrels, and lower coll downs for the tree when theres more squirrels.\n\nZip feels painfully slow for the gimmick hes supposed to have, and Chunk is a sitting duck if he doesnt have a shield. Other than that maybe some more types of squirrels could be added like a healer who can revive as an ability? Or a demo squirrel who could possibly stun the tree from throwing anything but the little balls? Just spit balling some ideas here.\n\n\nOther than that this is a great game that with a few tweaks could be made perfect for any quest owner!

The game is soooo fun. Basically, the person playing on vr takes the role of the tree. The tree has rocks and throws them to kill the squirrels to protect the acorns. The squirrels, playing on their phones, need to capture 4 acorns. There are 4 different types of squirrels you can play with different abilities, building bridges, digging tunnels, holding a big shield, and going the speed of the flash. I love the way that the game looks and feels. It's just a really fun game overall. The game is definitely more developed on the vr side of things. The mobile version is definitely buggy, but in a really funny way. There are bugs where you go through a tunnel while holding a shield and you are launched into space. It's hilarious. It's best when you have at least 3 squirrels. The bots are complete garbage and basically do nothing. The tutorial in the game is really simple and explains pretty well.

Frankly, it's an under-tapped market.\nNot much to say. It's a lot of fun. 2-8 people on mobile devices play as squirrels, stealing the acorns from the VR player (a tree). I've played this a lot. My entire family have become quick fans: siblings, parents, even grandparents! Everyone requests it when we get all together.\n\nThere's definitely no tutorial for the squirrels; the tutorial the devs point out is for the tree. Not a big deal because it's fairly intuitive, but it'd be helpful.\n\nThe game supplies decent AI squirrels, but you're required to have at least 2 mobile users to start... why... I get it's meant to be a multiplayer game, and that's definitely how it's most fun. But... just let us play solo if we want.\n\nMuch needed improvements:\n1. Add greater customization to games for users to adjust: change round length, change number of acorns, etc. A good tree can get unbalanced, and some simple adjustments like that would help.\n2. Since it's designed as a local party game, it would be nice to have a better HMD-sharing mode. Like, after X rounds it switches to a new person. And something that could keep track of the trees would be fun for points and friendly competition.\n3. Allow for solo play. You literally already have AI enemy squirrels, it's just silly that you REQUIRE 3 players to even start a game.\n\nThere are a few glitches: when loading in, the most recent squirrel gets labeled \"player name\".\nOften when chunk gets hit while holding an acorn and shield, he'll go flying across the screen.\nSometimes the acorn will glitch around the screen, seems to happen in tunnels most of the time.\n\n\nHonestly, don't let that discourage you.

However, when a squirrel gets an acorn and heads back, they cant see where they are going as the camera is locked on the tree and so you often fall into water or and endless pit. Furthermore, the tree has an aim assist and so it is almost impossible for the squirrels to win unless there are many of them that are willing to strategies as the bots in the game have no idea what theyre doing and just fall off into the abyss. If you are playing with 2 squirrels and no bots, you can pick up both squirrels and wait till instant death to kills them and win. This is game breaking. Also Id love if they didnt make it 2 players minimum as sometimes I have trouble finding people who den play.

The mechanics of the game are great and are user friendly, my grandma had no problem learning the controls after I gave her a tutorial. This game has a lot of replay value with many squirrels to unlock and levels to play.

If there are fewer squirrels, 2 or 3) it is really easy for the tree to win. If there are 4 or 5 squirrels playing, it is more likely the squirrels will win. There is no in between. I wish there was a way it could adjust the trees capabilities based on the number of squirrels. For example, if there are less squirrels, the tree is more handicapped and if there are more squirrels the tree has a larger arsenal. Cant wait for more maps and squirrels.

The Tree always wins.\n\nPros:\nVR features (throwing things and moving in place) work really well.\nDifferent squirrel abilities (builder, digger, etc) gives the game a good helping of replay-ability.\nThe game is pretty fun.\n\nCons:\nSquirrels can't see when returning to base - the camera angle is always pointed at the tree. The Developer had said, repeatedly that this is intentional. But it means that on levels with water, or voids the squirrels fall in before they even see the drop. And if there is a ledge the squirrels just get stuck. If you're trying to nerf the squirrels by making them memorize the maps then I personally think the game just isn't well thought out.\nAI is dumb. There are a couple of levels with water and drop offs and the AI simply never makes it back to the base with an acorn even if (as the tree) I throw NOTHING. Sadly this means that you can't make up for lacking enough friends by adding CPU players.\nRequires a ton of friends and phones! I would increase my rating considerably if I could play online with strangers, or add an arbitrary amount of CPU players to my room. As it is I have 3 phones/tablets in my house and 1 headset. The best I can do is add 3 squirrels to my game, then after the game starts I have one of the tablets disconnect (because I don't actually have 3 friends to play with) - then a CPU takes over.\nCan not pick the levels. My 7 year old daughter (like the CPU ai) can NOT manage to cross voids/water without dying. Would be nice if I could specify which level I want when she is playing a squirrel.\n\nIt's possible that, as squirrel players get more experience playing the game will self balance. However there needs to be a way to nerf the Tree until then\nI would say that if the Developers somehow fix the game balance (allow more CPUs, allow online matchmaking, or nerf the tree?), and fix the squirrel camera view this could easily be my favorite party game.

Makes me wonder why there aren't more games like it around.\n\nSome ideas I have for this game is maybe have powerups that the tree and squirrels can fight over. It can sometimes feel like a map is too favorable to one side and this could add a little bit more push and pull to the match. Like you can make it so the more acorns a side has the closer the powerup is to the other side. The power ups can be be something like a faster cool down or double the size of projectiles.\n\nAnother game mode that would be great is one where the tree is stealing the acorns back from the squirrels. They can build a fort and as a tree I need to break it down faster then the squirrels can build it up. Kind of like angry birds. Or I can send out little Trent's that atk and steal acorns away from the fort.\n\nThis game is great and anything added will be icing on the cake. Thank you guys for developing such a great game at a nice price. I have more ideas but I feel like this is long enough.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseApr 8 at 4:30 AM\n\nWe're so glad to hear that you're enjoying the game with your brothers!

The controls are also simple and easy to learn for both the tree and the squirrels.

Too bad you need at least two squirrels to start the game. This is fine when his friends are visiting but if not I found a way to get around this: use a spare mobile to join the game and after the game starts just exit the session. It will then be replaced by an AI while my son controls the other squirrel.

Best way to get everyone involved when playing VR. However from a 20 game I'd expect more customizability: being able to choose a specific map, more free skins for the squirrels and maybe more game styles (hide and seek?). Ideally, I would also be able to join existing public games created by strangers. I love the game, but I can only play if my friends are available. Finally, as mentioned by others, the FOV of the squirrels feels a little blocked which gives the tree a great advantage as he can literally see everything.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMar 20 at 2:35 AM\n\nWe really appreciate your feedback!

It will definitely bring some laughs and good memories. I am on the fence if the price tag is worth the experience for the flaws below\n\nThe game is limited with some design flaws. The major issue is the \"tree\" is extremely powerful and there is essentially nothing the \"squirrels\" can do to limit that power. With the 3 types of projectiles that can be thrown, the \"tree\" will win most games. It was so one-sided that my friends and I started to play with only hand. Which certianly evened the playing field and mad with more enjoyable.\n\nFor the Designer, I can think of 3 suggestions that would greatly improve the game in my mind.\n\n1. Allow the \"squirrels\" to change their perspective, especially once they have the acorns. Many times the \"squirrels\" fell off the map or got stuck due it not seeing where they were going. If you are worried about where to put this control, put it the taunt button it. The taunt is essentially useless.\n\n2. Map selection. Some of your maps are just hard to play. There are pits, water, or other obstacles that make the one-sided nature of the game even more so.\n\n3. Create a way for the \"squirrels\" to limit the \"trees\" power. Maybe something to limit the vision or the projectiles that can be used.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMar 23 at 3:24 AM\n\nHello, this is very valuable information to us!

They will pick up the acorn, walk around aimlessly, and sometimes bring it TOWARDS the tree! This is probably why they require 2 real players to begin with. You can probably pitch 8 AI against a stationary tree and theyll never win (not actually tested). Maybe machine learning can lend a hand here? If thats too hard, a set path for every map*squirrel type will do nicely as well.\n\nUI is slightly confusing: I had no idea there are other squirrel types until 2 games in, and also had no idea AI existed at first - you can pick a game of 8 but have only 2 real players.\n\nAnd the balance needs tweaking - the tree shouldnt be able to generate weapons so fast in a vs 2 squirrel game.

It's difficult to find that one game to engage a group of players, especially one where VR is centerpiece. But if you ever find yourself with a group of people and you want to show off VR this HAS to be a \"go-to\" game. Everyone can join in. I believe it can accommodate eight players.\n\nIf you like Jackbox Party games but want something more entertaining which involves VR then this is definitely worth picking up.\n\nMore levels would be appreciated but that's a minor issue. It's limited in scope, don't expect much depth here - it's purely concentrating on having FUN.\n\nHelpful | 0", "leaper1981Oct 7 at 3:53 AM\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. It's one of the most fun games to play with a group of people. The ability to have players on mobile devices makes the game. It's very addictive and way more tactical than you might think. The hectic chaos of having 4 players as squirrels is brilliant. I'd probably say if you have at least 2 people that can join in this is the best game on Quest period!

Sadly we had some bugs.\n\n1. Sometimes the nut disapears for a squirrel and only the arrow is left. It seems to happen if multiple squirrels want to grab a nut at the same time. Not sure if this is really the cause.\n\n2. Playing with an iOS user sometimes results in a mismatch of maps. The iOS user then plays on a different map than the tree, resulting in funny positions of the squirrel.\n\n3. Grabbing a squirrel is sometimes very hard. Throwing a squirrel in the direction you want to, is even harder. If the tree throws the squirrel into the water, it seldomly flies into the water. Instead it just flies zigzag back to the nut. Also grabbing a squirrel sometimes lets it drop the nut, sometimes not. Once I threw a squirrel back to the squirrel-base... With the nut.\n\n4. Emojis in the name can be entered, but are not visible. This results in invisible names.\n\nSome further improvements could be made:\n1. Autodetect the roomcode if all are in the same wifi.\n2.

The hard thing about party games is trying to get everyone up to speed on how to play and teaching the person using the headset what to do. Plus they can be a little buggy, since they are interfacing with other devices. Thats what makes this game so awesome!\nSetup is simple. The people with phones enter their name and the connection code. The person with the headset gives the connection code and waits for everyone to join. Thats it! For its maiden voyage I did not find anything buggy about it, for both the headset or the phone app.\nGameplay was straightforward and easy to figure out, yet the gameplay is engaging enough to keep you interested. I tried it with adults and with kids and it seemed to be engaging for both. I love that there are different types of squirrels and different environments. I also love blue there were certain hidden tricks to improve gameplay that you learn as you go.\nThe game play at first will feel like the tree is a little overpowered, but once you learn how to use the squirrels abilities as a team it becomes super hard for the tree and everything balances out. There isnt a single player mode on the app or the headset, but the headset had a tutorial game that is engaging enough. Id love to see the same on the phone app. I also love that the phone app is free. The graphics are great on this, and there seemed to be very few laggy situations. They even give the tree the ability to see the network and connection statistics during game play!\nAs long as two squirrels play you can have up to 8 (which is amazing!). It will fill in with AI squirrels until others join (which they can do mid game). Such a fun game!

The underground tunnels float high above the ground and the shields stay in the air if raised on the bridge, obstructing the view (can be used as a tactic).\nStill, money well spent.

We even had my almost 70 year old mother and father in law playing. We had nine people from ages 6 to almost 70 laughing and yelling and heckling each other. The VR is so simple that my video game challenged in laws were able to have a blast as the tree too.\nThe one thing that everyone agreed on is that the squirrels need to be able to change their view so that when running back to the base with a nut you could actually see where you are going. This didnt make the game any less fun, it would just be more user friendly for the squirrels to see where they are going.\nMy son likes to use his XBox controller to play games on his Android phone and said it would have been awesome to be able to pair his controller with the phone app instead of just using the on screen controls.\nI think it would be amazing to someday play as a squirrel in VR too.

Frame rate was smooth and there didnt seem to be any lag. It was incredibly simple to understand and it was very fun to experiment with different squirrel powers.\nBear in mind that the game defaults to having aim assist on for the tree.\nI wish there was a way to add handicaps for either the squirrels or tree. I imagine that the tree would lose every time once you get like 5 squirrels going. For us the tree won most of the time. Still, I can not recommend this game enough. I only wish there were optional handicaps or ways to play in single player.\n\nHelpful | 3", "BGZ91Sep 2, 2019 at 6:21 PM\nAwesome\n\nMy favorite new game, maybe the devs can start a discord channel so solo players can find some match play and really expand this games potential.

EU or USW) and make sure that your internet connection is stable.

The apps work fllawless for both ios and Android. Game play is smooth and fun. The only downside is that their seem to be around 4maps each are small. Only 4 squirrel types and 1 tree type. Feel like different trees would be awesome with different abilitys like through thorns on the ground or something who knows. Also would be nice to see a little graphic update on the ios and Android apps. Also :) would love a flying squirrel that could float down from the platforms you can build.

However - there are a number of bugs/weird interactions that kindof ruin it. I'm going to get into that part, but given that this is a public review and I really do love this game I want to lead with the positive. This game is an absolute blast, and now reigns supreme as my favoured way to introduce new players to VR as a concept. Really easy to set up games, no noticeable lag even on my dodgy internet. Interesting class choices with surprising depth for only having one button different between them, yet above all stands the experience of playing a goddamn raid boss. Nothing is quite like snapping around your heels trying to predict the movement of squirrels only to snatch one off the floor. I literally cannot help myself lifting them to eye level to revel in having caught them, and to take a moment thinking of where would be most pleasing to hurl them - even though it's a proper waste of time. It's so instantly immersive that I can't help a bit of impromptu larp xD top marks on that part. Haven't really found a fault on the tree side of this and despite the bugs and whatnot I've encountered on the squirrel side of things - I wish I could just show you all footage of my 5'nothing friend cackling as they murdered us. Indeed - I recommend filming your friends when they first get to try it out. Just - make sure they're real familiar with how the guardian boundaries work, we've already lost a full mug of tea and a plate to enthusiastic squirrel-hurling xD\n\n\nNow - on to the issues. I want to be constructive here as I'm aware this is early days and the Devs seem pretty receptive. I'll say this first though - the whole mandatory added players thing isn't one of them. It's a multiplayer game! Just, let them make the game they're trying to make people. Stop whinging about the lack of single player. Sure it would be cool - but I'd much rather they devoted their resources to making the multiplayer experience more refined. Anyway, with that said, moving swiftly onwards ~\n\n\n1) due to how small the screen space is on the phone, it's super difficult to tell where exactly some stuff is when you're trying to run back to the base. Also, there's sooo many spots where you seem to get irrevocably stuck, and the only option is to kill yourself to respawn. One level has a ledge you can fall onto, but can't seem to escape? Maybe I'm being dumb, but that seems pretty counter intuitive. I don't want to suggest hobbling level design variety - but could you maybe let them use their roll to get up diagonal surfaces? Idk jack about the kind of coding this would involve/weird knock-on effects it could result in, so apologies if that's a silly suggestion/if my lack of base knowledge similarly invalidates any further suggestions in this review!\n\n\n2) the tunnels the digger makes can be suuper glitchy. Sometimes due to the turning circle of the squirrels, you exit one, try to do something, and then endlessly bounce back and forth re-entering the same tunnel. Also sometimes they just legit don't work at all - I wind up spinning in circles trying to enter one and I don't want to kick off about it in the group as the person playing the tree is clearly having a wonderful time, but the frustration mounts pretty quickly.\n\n\n3) the giant boulder things the tree throws remain lethal on contact even when they're just lying there, and sometimes they literally come to a rest *on the spawn point*. This is exceedingly frustrating and instantly kills the mood for whoever just gets stuck by it. Idk - maybe have an area that automatically shoves stuff away around the spawn point? Or have it somehow covered? Currently - if the trees aim is good enough they can just put one there and the only thing stopping them is politeness.\n\n\n4) I truly understand (or, have sympathy for at least) the limitations you're working with on a phone app - but there are a few instances where the movement controls are a huge barrier. The process of getting to grips with the one that builds bridges isn't clever positioning of them, but rather figuring out how to not fall off. Maybe if you made a like, context sensitive button for interacting with certain movement situations? It could kill two glitchy bits with one stone as you could press it to dive off the path and use the same button space for entering tunnels? Have them light up ever so slightly when you're in range of them maybe? Being able to run around without having to tiptoe about for fear of just falling off would make the bridge class so much more engaging.\n\n\n5) occasionally tunnels will wind up coming out in water, which the players can aim to avoid - but given one of the joys of this is how easy it is to pick up new players and introduce them to VR with this thing, I feel like barriers for entry should be considered at the absolute neophyte stage. We learned not to do it after a bit but it's still pretty frustrating and having them clip to either side of the river would be great. This sort of comes back to the invalid game state issue with ledges.\n\n\nThinking back to that - would it be possible to have a small button that briefly, while you're holding your thumb on it flips up a map for reference? Have a little ring that fades in around where you are to draw your eye. I think intrusive indicators would be annoying over normal gameplay given the space they'd take up, but an easier way to get your bearings would be awesome. It makes sense for the camera angle to be locked on the tree - all the information you need to react to is in that direction and it's imperative that the shield squirrel keeps his shield in the right direction, but losing because you accidentally trap yourself/derp into a river feels like you've been robbed, rather than the tree doing something clever.\n\n\nPhew. End rant. I'd like to take a moment to repeat that I desperately want to give this game five stars and will gleefully amend my review as stuff gets resolved. The concept is excellent and I love what VR as a medium is now exploring with different perspectives/asymmetric experiences in general. Makes me want to learn how to make them myself. Keep up the good work - this game is already a lot of fun, and every hole in the immersion that gets plugged can only add to that <3\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseSep 17, 2019 at 4:36 AM\n\nThank you so much for this detailed feedback and you have a lot of very valid points.
