You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with our products. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Microsoft and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.\n\nIf you represent an organization, such as a business or school, that utilizes Enterprise and Developer Products from Microsoft, please see the Enterprise and developer products section of this privacy statement to learn how we process your data.

When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature. Likewise, where we need to collect personal data by law or to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract; or if this relates to an existing product youre using, we may have to suspend or cancel it. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.

Our automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods. For example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do. To build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made. For example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.\n\nLearn more\nTop of page\nReasons we share personal data\n\nWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

Unfortunately on any platform you will get people that are mean and just want to create trouble. But that's just a hand full of them. Don't let the ones that are mean to push you away from this great experience. There is more people on this that are just like you and only wants to make a friend and just have fun!\nThere is alot of kids and I mean alot.\nAs well as adults. Kids are more daring then adults. Like one I met on this and i was going to report him because he was only 11 years old. But I kept a eye on him and wondered why a kid would be on this. Came to find out he was meeting with friends and they was talking about Pokmon go lmao. But at the same time I was a bit concerned because we all know the internet is really not safe. So I teleported to them and had a serious talk with them. I told them ( look I know you guys are way to young for this game why are you even here? They responded that this is the only way for them to meet because of covid. So I stopped them and I understood 100% so after warning them about the bad of the internet and what not to do. I told them to have fun and left.\nPoint is not all children are looking to make trouble there in the same situation as all of us and want to see there friends. So lighten up a bit.\n\nHelpful | 51\nDeveloper ResponseJul 6 at 4:31 PM\n\nHeya lati101! Thanks for the great feedback. It's very good advice and we appreciate you sharing your thoughts.

But I have seen MANY accounts of sexual harassment, racism, and bullying, all in the same time playing the game I was even bullied. The moderators/admins just ban people they don't like or think are to young, without even knowing their age. Also, a term \"squeakers\" has become popular meaning kids in the game. Sometimes, it's just kids not even knowing what they're doing or them trying to have fun because that's someone they bond with. I would say to solve it make sure they have full parental permission. Also, make sure you ban the person bullying not the person being bullied, and don't ignore stuff because admins did it.\n\nHelpful | 31\nDeveloper ResponseJul 6 at 4:20 PM\n\nHello kingofnerds64.

Just by having your event featured by them you can get 20-30 attendees.\nThey actually have staff dedicated to helping you publish events.\nThey are one of the few apps to have browser functionality allowing you to play slides and videos.\nThey can hold 80 people in one room(most competitors can hold a max of 40 at best).\nTheir moderation tools in terms of hand raises, muting, stage blocking, etc.. are premiere.\nFront row allows unlimited attendees.\n\nCons\nSometimes can use better communication to users on direction of company.\nNo scripting unless through their niche MRE SDK( should have made a unity sdk instead like vrchat.

I was saying my age because some worlds on Altspace are not appropriate for my age, and then the next thing I know is Ive been banned just because I asked a question. I know Im 2 years younger than the allowed age but she could have told me that, it really hurt me knowing Ive been banned and cant play Altspace just because I was curious about a world and if I should go.

They then apologized for being wrong and then immediately flagged me again for no reason. The admin of the game was a kid.

Much better than VR chat and Rec Room, however it glitches a lot and you have to often go out and come back in. Twice Altspace has frozen my headset and I cant shut it down. I have to let it set until the battery dies. It has a lot of issues that need fixed. There is a card game called Holograms against reality thats fun for a short time but many of the questions and answers are long winded and corny. The game needs completely rewritten. On the upside I have made many friends in the game and we are venturing out into worlds more.\n\nHelpful | 42\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 18 at 10:19 AM\n\nHi Mark-Bliss! Thanks for the kind review.

One lady yelled at me for walking up on their conversation but I was just learning how to use my new VR headset so I didnt mean to.\nI just think its stupid to get banned and not even get a warning or explanation as to why.\nAnd the fact that just anyone can complain and ban you makes it way too easy for some person who just doesnt like you to get you permanently banned.\n\n\nI did contact the support team.

The events I have done so far are not exciting and they are usually run by someone who easily power trips, like this recent ratedvr late night talk show...they booted and banned my wife for touching the stage..that was her first Alt Space event and she was only looking for me. No warning, just straight banned. That is not how you treat people, much less a newcomer. Throwing snowballs, sticking sparklers in a fire, and awkwardly throwing a ball in a hoop are only entertaining for a short time.\n\nThat pretty much leaves speaking to others as the only thing to do. Some of the conversations are funny but unless you are extroverted, it gets old quick.\n\nIt is still decent though.\n\nIf I want to chat I can do so on bigscreen beta as well as watch decent content, see my computer, and synchronisly host my own videos to others in my room.

Could learn about many things, some topics and events I have interests as a TV producer, and as a person with many interest. Then I saw all the bad reviews, people getting banned and they don't know why? I always go to the bad reviews first. But I should tell you I like the AltSpaceVR, the events, chats with mostly adult people. But, I also figured out why many people were angry about being blocked because it Happened to me when I was banned for being disruptive when I left the meet I was attending. I thought how could I be disruptive, I watched quietly, mic muted, listen not moving around or anything. I was a little upset and thought these many complains were right. So I went to the campfire chat room and started asking around to find out what I possibly did wrong. I liked this VR place and didn't want to lose the opportunity to go to some events I liked, and then get banned. The first thing I learned, nothing about being banned, but funny was: when I started asking other people, avatars, what I could have done wrong they said, \"hey man it's really odd you are in a girl's body with such a deep voice\". I said, I am? I thought I picked a skinny guy avatar with short hair\". \"Nope, your a girl\". And then helped me change to a guy character. And pointed me to someone who might know why I got charged with being disruptive. To make a long story end soon . . . Use the simple enter button, Don't Portal out of an event. I thought that was just leaving. Portal out, I guess makes some visual disruptions and invites the other guest to leave with you. Or something like that. My apologies to the Moderator that banned me but, I hovered over the portal button hoping it told me what it did. But it told me nothing. So, I had no idea why I angered the Moderator of the event by using the Portal to exit. I'm happy I investigated it because I like the app. Imagine all those many angry reviews of people, who don't understand why they were disruptive. Those bad reviews would not have been written if the menu just included a warning. Also don't be fooled when you first enter, before you make an account, and log in. The young kids walking around under 13 can't get in,and the displays won't get you anywhere. You need to log in to AltSpaceVR to see what it really has to offer. I almost didn't make and account thinking it was another kids chat room talking about dead cats and my dad has a giant knives in the garage. Yes, there some younger teens in there but there are many neat adult topics and events. I can't wait to go back and participate. And it was free. The best chat and events app out there.

People are very polite, they try not to talk over each other, and even when its obvious that one of the avatars is a kid and not really sure what theyre doing, I have found everyone to be patient and open minded with them which isnt always the case in other social apps. Theyre usually so excited to be in VR that its infectious.There are community helpers that step in when they need to. Also a great way to connect with people you know already from the real world.

The level of graphics are elevated from the other experiences I have had. Everything is growing and updating by listening to user feedback. The developers are actively participating and have representatives that are accessible and there to speak to in real time. In one day I joined a 101 ( Highly recommend) to learn about the app and it was very helpful and informative I wasn't just blindly wandering around trying to figure out what to do for once. I was then asked to join a test group to see what the screen rate was at for Quest specifically, so that they could improve on it. I had a problem with my screenname also showing my real name. Found a guide/admin named Jeremy, who was standing at the campground, and right there fixed the problem. Just like that as I spoke to him. I was just blown away that I didn't have to struggle to get this fixed. There is so much support for the new VR user and pros alike. Bravo to this team on making us feel like we ARE the consumers but also the contributors. Quest users are HEARD and not treated as \"teleporters\" or something lower than other users with a powerful PC running the experience. It is a whole new world for VR and the shift, the forethought and active listening in this community is amazing. Then I played an amazing irreverent VR versions of CAH (Card Against Humanity) that just tickled me to no end. I met like minded, (although no of us should admit it :) ) people, who got it. Made adult friends and just.... wow. This has turned my experience with VR around. Bravo guys.

In other social experiences, the more people there are in any one room/map, the performance decreases but with Altspace I was in quite a few places with sometimes 30+ people but the performance stayed the same, incredible!

Game feels so much more fluid on the Oculus Quest with the freedom of no cables and 6Dof.Devs are great.

Great tip! Thanks for your review.", "JayPea02Sep 19, 2019 at 3:08 PM\nNeeds work\n\nI love the idea of this app. Hanging out and playing games with friends or random people you dont know is awesome. What is not awesome are some of the moderators on there. Some are cool others are on some power trip and are not very nice. Other than that its definitely a awesome app just will wait until they fix the moderators system they got now\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper ResponseSep 27, 2019 at 3:31 PM\n\nHey JayPea02. Thanks for your insights. Sorry to hear some of the moderators you encountered were challenging. We strive to make AltspaceVR as welcoming and safe for everyone as possible, so many mods take our Community Standards very seriously. We encourage you to try hosting some events or activities of your own! That way, you're more in control of your experience.", "GiantRobot115Sep 20, 2019 at 2:46 PM\nSucks\n\nIt sucks\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseSep 27, 2019 at 3:39 PM\n\nHi GiantRobot115.
