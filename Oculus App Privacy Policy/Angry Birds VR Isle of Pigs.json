Congratulations to the team for this superb level design.\n\nAlso, the developers are regularly updating the game. The most recent update (June/July 2020) brought an online level creator and achievements, which are super fun to collect. I'm still hoping that we'll get those last 2 Spooky Worlds!

I will say I haven't played the level builder, but from what I've heard it's good. Though I would recommend the Devs introduce multiplayer.

Ill pass because Ive played that game to death.\n\nNow Im someone who has owned multiple Angry Birds apps and enjoyed them all thoroughly, but Im sort of in a been there, done that mode now when it comes to AB.\n\nSo I turned my phone off and rolled over. Then I thought, AB in VR... hmm, I wonder what... So I sat up, unlocked my phone, watched the trailer and bought the app 30 seconds later because, oh yeah Angry Birds in VR!\n\nIm now holding the slingshot. I can lean, I can twist, I can squat, I can cheat and move really closer than I should. Its a blast. My 8-year old and 4-year old love it too. The little bird animations with thumbs ups and indignant looks of annoyance are priceless. My mother was cracking up over them.\n\nIts an easy game for beginners who come to your house and just want to try out VR. Give them the headset, hand them the controllers and basically do nothing else. It is so intuitive its hard not to do it right.\n\nI am on the fourth stage now, so I assume I will beat it pretty soon and then probably play it here or there when I want something quick, but not really all that much after that. Who knows though? Maybe theres a surprise waiting for me that will keep me coming back for more! For the kids, for guests, and for that 10 mins when I want to do something quick, $15 is well worth it to me.\n\nThis is a great addition to my small library that I am very picky about.\n\nThanks Rovio,\nHouston\n\nPS, I havent had those tracking issues on my Quest mentioned in others reviews.

It is 100% competent. The mechanics have been translated exactly, the 3D structures fall apart with the right kind of physics as the original game,\n\nbut its just not fun.\n\nA big part of this is the slingshot action. First of all, it first bends the stick without the rubber band moving, then the rubber band sort of animates inorganically from not-stretched to stretched, then its basically linear motion as you move your hands, and it all sucks. Before buying my Oculus Quest I went to a VR arcade nearby, paying $24 per hour, three times, and spent maybe half of all my time there in the Longbow minigame of Valves The Lab. There are significant similarities between this and that game, yet Ive paid $72 already just to try that for a short while, and I may seriously go again one day for that, while I might return this game instead of owning this experience forever because Id rather get my $15 back. And its a huge part of it is because aiming and firing the longbow is organic and exciting and feels like it takes skill, you feel like A hero its amazing fun. And Ive done real archery too, I know how fake it is, yet it never gets old. But aiming and firing an angry bird feels like making a gesture to trigger a pre-set animation. I can see how the current state of it faithfully recreates the original mechanic, but that mechanic was made for adjusting your finger by very slight amounts on a phone screen in 2D, and it doesnt translate to broad two-handed gestures. Firing a real rubber band off your finger at a coffee cup is more exciting than firing an animated character in a colourful world at a destructible structure, and thats a problem.\n\nRovio, please remove the flat plate the bird sits on, make the central bit flexible, and make that rubber band realistically rubbery and stretchy. Make it get tighter and stiffer as I pull, so my hand has to move further back to get ever less motion until it seems to hit a natural limit of maximum tension. Make that giant thick wooden slingshot bend only after the rubber is already tight, give it some physics feel. Dumb as it may seem, the physics aspect was a huge part of what made the original smartphone game stand out, it was a new concept at the time. Basically, please find a way to make it fun to be firing the birds regardless of what youre firing them at, because right now its really lame.\n\nPositive feedback:\n\nHaving different firing locations is a good idea. I think it needs a little massaging to work better because I dont think a higher vantage point is ever good for destroying things, but its a good new mechanic when working in 3D. Its pleasing to see. Id enjoy a system where your locations are from secure or hidden locations so it feels like youre firing from there for a reason, ambushing the pigs.\n\nI really like that bringing up the menu and restarting a level takes two button presses and only two seconds, when so many other games punish you for resetting or reloading a level by having long fade-outs, loading times, cutscenes even. Im praising this because its rare! Its really good for keeping the fun going, and I appreciated when playing with it for the first time was that I could try firing a couple of times, reset, and try some more, without losing the flow. A practice arena where you can keep firing birds at a (regenerating each time?) structure would be great for the same reason, a playground to get a feel for what you can do with the game mechanics and just blow off steam. Then the levels become more about planning and executing your demolition.\n\nHey since its 3D, wouldn it be cool to have one of those slingshots with two rubber bands one set high one set low and the pocket strung between them, sort of like a sideways H? It might not fit the aesthetic :-/ But playing with the slingshot geometry in general (or having different options?) might offer a way around the Quest issue that one controller occludes the other, say by having a slingshot you hold sideways, or a normal slingshot but instead of firing it like a pebble from your thumb and forefinger, you pull it back with your first using the grip button, which rotates the top of the closer controller out of the way.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseDec 6 at 1:25 AM\n\nThank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us! We really appreciate the detailed explanation of what you would like to see in the game. It sounds like an interesting idea to explore different ways of using a slingshot.

With the quest room scale you can walk the length of the beach to reposition yourself as well as teleporting yourself to higher grounds.

In VR.\nYou catapult birds of various temperaments and colors at little green pigs, and try to blow their house down. I'm not sure what kinds of psychedelics they're using at Rovio Entertainment, or if the Goldilocks story got seriously mistranslated, but it's all rather nonsensical. Then again, if you want a nuanced story, go play Bioshock, or The Last of Us. This is all about animal cruelty and making pigs homeless.\nI'm docking it one star, because it's a bit short and also because the birds aren't really angry enough for my taste. They're more 'Mildly Perturbed Birds', although they do become 'Slightly Pissed Birds' towards the end.\nYou can dock it another star if you're a member of PETA or something, I dunno.\n\nHelpful | 11", "Bigd1251Oct 25 at 10:25 PM\nNice\n\nIt's pretty good\n\nHelpful | 1", "bmo22Aug 23, 2019 at 1:27 AM\n3 stars, great port to vr with flaws\n\nAs others reviewers said, this game is an amazing port to VR, and the gameplay is fun and entertaining.

The standard Angry Birds gameplay translates really well into colorful and approachable VR environment that is as satisfying to play as the first Angry Birds from many years ago. I was not expecting much because the iOS (AR) version of this game was so graphically buggy as to be unplayable beyond the first dozen levels. Thankfully, the Quest version doesn't have this issue. Being fully immersed in the Angry Birds universe is very interesting. With a bird in the slingshot, you can turn and point it at your face and look straight into the face of an animated 3D bird. Very cool.\nOn the other hand, it does have a few annoying bugs. The slingshot periodically freezes in place as it loses track of your controller. This cannot be blamed on being \"too close to your face\" because it's not. It freezes up in a weird place and pointing in a strange direction even while I'm waving my arm fully extended in front of the unit. The other 10+ games I have installed do not have this problem. Only Angry Birds. Stop blaming the players in the feedback, developers! This is your bug that needs fixing.\nA second issue is that the game is very short, with only 52 levels (13 groups of 4). This sounds like a lot, but about half of them are extremely easy and sometimes over in 15 seconds, one shot, first try, with 3 stars. Those levels I felt were difficult were difficult in a frustrating way, rather than a fun way. I'm saying that the level design needs some work. I finished the game in under an hour of total time, I think. That's fine for a $5 game, not so fine for a $15 one. I know they will be releasing more levels (as they did in other Angry Birds implementations) and I welcome that, but I hope the levels get better and more interesting than the ones that are available at Quest launch.\n\nHelpful | 87\nDeveloper ResponseSep 13, 2019 at 2:06 AM\n\nThanks for the feedback, jsgcxxx! We've noted down the points that you've mentioned. Regarding the tracking, what seems to be a factor here is that inside-out tracking of Oculus Quest makes it hard to track both controllers when they are lined up (one not being visible to the cameras of the headset). We will, of course, always make sure to see what we can do in terms of improvement on our side as well.

The Quest currently has some tracking issues when one controller hides the other and this sometimes shows up in this game, because it involves you firing a catapult. Slightly annoying sometimes, but not a dealbreaker because you just have to adjust the position of your hands. The game is accessible and you can play at your own pace. There are different types of ammo and you can select different viewpoints for most levels, of which there are many.

Angry Birds VR was the first game I bought as the 15 dollar price tag was easily justifiable when reading more into the continued support this title will receive, having more levels being added at a later date. The controls are easy to learn while the gameplay remained challenging. I intended on buying this as a good first game for both myself and my five year old son to learn the basics of VR and it did just that. Something to keep in mind about the Quest is that the way your movements are tracked is by the built-in sensors in the head gear. Get your hands too close to your face and youre bound to have issues. Once this was explained to my son, no issues were had from then on. If you are still having issues with movement tracking, the system does work on a form of guesstimating. Once your hands leave the area of play (as far as the headset is concerned), as long as you make your movements swift and relatively predictable you should be able further minimize any issues being had.\n\nHelpful | 3", "appletattooguyJun 5, 2019 at 2:06 AM\nAwesome game but needs work on tracking\n\nReally enjoying playing this but do find as other reviews have pointed out that the tracking can be off at times.
