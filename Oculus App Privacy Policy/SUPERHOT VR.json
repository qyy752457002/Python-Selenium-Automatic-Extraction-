A fairly short campaign and some meager endgame content is all this really has.\n\nEven with all my complaints, one statement stands true. This is a game that every VR user should own.\n\nHelpful | 412", "Day_LinkzJun 30 at 12:28 PM\nOculus VR SuperHot\n\nParents might be worried about there kids spending to much time on video games. But my advice having played this game is that its a workout. You will find yourself sweating at the end of it, so I advise parent to be a little bit more lenient about the time limits for their kids, but of course its up to the parents\n\nHelpful | 66", "Mattplus097 days ago\nDone Buying Quest Titles - NO FACEBOOK!\n\nSuperhot is amazing and most people agree. Facebook...not so much. I won't buy anymore quest software and will detatch from the oculus product line since they will make facebook membership mandatory by 1 Jan 2023 for current users and this year for new buyers. I'm sure PSVR2 will have many lessons learned when it comes out. Superhot is super good though! Peace!\n\nHelpful | 4", "bruno.buldersoJul 20 at 1:05 PM\nGreat game, but so short..\n\nThis is an absolutely amazing game, with great mechanics, level layout and and overall theme. A must buy vr game. It may seem simple, but can be very deep, as your trying to figure out the most creative way to destroy your enemies. Everything just comes together so smoothly and makes you feel like a proffesional hired merceanary. But this game has one fatal flaw - its just so short . I went in, and was completly immersed in this world, feeling like Neo from matrix and John Wick combined. The time that it lasted it was great, but i ended up finishing it in about 50 min. Of course, the other modes will lengthten your playtime, but everything, exept the endless mode are the same levels, that just get repetitive, real fast. And the endless mode doesnt really give you the same satasfaction, that a carefully and painstakingly handcrafted level does. I really wish they would add new levels or at least create DLC, (that i would hapily buy). Every single friend ive given this game to play, has loved it, and is the reason, that they want a vr headset themselves, but even most of my friends finished the whole game in one visit. I feel like, if there were more levels, i could play this game 24 hours nonstop . Really hoping that they could make a vr port of the new MIND CONTROL DELETE DLC, thats only available on flatscreen right now.\n\nHelpful | 10", "Cian28Jun 18 at 4:49 PM\nA VR Must-Have!\n\nSuper-Hot has a John Wick/ Atomic Blonde feel to its gameplay: placing you in seemingly deadly scenarios, this game will test your ability to think strategically.\n\nThe name leaves a lot to the imagination, with very little being explained, but Ill sum up the game with this famous phrase: Time Only Moves When You Move. Wanna go all out like John Wick? Go for it! Under pressure, and need more time to think? Stop moving and watch your surroundings slow down to a standstill. This game is truly made for all types of players: it is so well engineered.\n\nReplayability: 8/10: The enemy AI is fantastically designed, and difficult judge at times. The campaign mode isnt the only one you have: at the end of the game, youll unlock 7 modes to play, including endless: where you fight until you are taken out by the enemies.\n\nPlot: 3/10: While there is a lack of a cohesive storyline, the games mysteriousness can make the ending quite interesting.\n\nGraphics: 9/10: The color palette and graphical style of the game is brilliant! A tricolored game of blacks, whites, and reds with simple geometric glass physics makes for a very fun and interesting game!\n\nGameplay elements: 7/10: There are many things you can grab and use as weapons in this game: pistols, pans, cups, daggers, cleavers, and a few more on top of that. Additionally, you can throw all objects in either epic Slo-Mo, or real-time, and test out your tossing skills. You must beware of enemies, which will try and shoot, stab, and punch you: eliminating you from the game.\n\nHelpful | 36", "Clonelab4 days ago\nHard to describe how good this game is.\n\nAs a child of the 80s, this is probably what I assumed the video game of the future would look like. Its a whole other thing to actually experience it. Cant stop playing this game. The mix of simple graphics, time stretching game play and freedom of movement is hard to describe. You just have to experience it.

Cant wait to 100% this one to! This has easily become one of my favorite games of all time since i got it a few years back and id recommend it to any one who plays video games in general, its truly a gem on all platforms!\n\nHelpful | 10", "camil895 days ago\nGrat game but to short!!!!!\n\nIt should have at least twice levels. Replaying same levels to find secrets its not definition of fun. Concept is great, gameplay is interesting but as i said its to short i would say its a rip off in that one aspect. Levels could be randomly generated to give more play time from graphical stand point You wont see difference they look randomly anyway.\n\nHelpful | 0", "In4mus83Jun 25 at 11:49 AM\nLoved the experience but too short\n\nEnjoyed ducking around my living rooms and taking cover behind virtual objects.

Honestly, its so much fun but it was over all too quickly!\n\nHelpful | 14", "Riley873317 days ago\nAmazing\n\nThis game is amazing!! I love all of the slow mo stuff and all! I hope there will be more levels soon but overall I love it! The only issue Ive had is people shooting, Im out of weapons and they arent conning closer, so Im just stuck sitting there, so I feel like the enemies should have a certain amount of bullets, (larger than usual) but one everyone runs out of bullets you move on\n\nHelpful | 0", "j_aem_138 days ago\nWell worth it - CW suicide\n\nSuperhot began life as the sort of game streamers played. The PC \\ console version is great, but this is an entirely different beast.\nIt's not a port, this has it's own story, locations and powers. If you have not played the vr game, you haven't experienced it. It's so cool and satisfying and a play through is a proper workout.\nOne criticism I have is, there should be strong content warnings for its suicide theme. Other than that, it's a blast.\nI found the length just right and finished it in about 8 or 9 40 minute sessions.\n\nHelpful | 1", "SStraker10 days ago\nFun and Addictive\n\nI live this game. Not only is it fun, it has been good for my health. I play almost every day and its helped my drop 15 plus pounds. The slow motion play in the game makes you move maneuver and contort your body as you duck and dodge in a slowed motion. Its kind of like yoga. It works different muscles. Im not saying its not fun. Its addictive and makes me sweat. I bought an extra face pad for my quest just to play the his game. On days I dont play I typically dont lose weight but on the morning after playing SUPERHOT Isabel often dripped a pound or more. Sounds crazy but it works for me! Besides the benefits of staying active this game is plain fun. There are supposedly secrets I havent learned to unlock which keeps it interesting. I love this app.\n\nHelpful | 1", "agentcj00611 days ago\nOfficially one of the best vr games ever\n\nI've played most of this game on Nintendo Switch and it was good, but vr is where this game really shines. All of the levels are extremely fun and can get pretty challenging later in the game. This, in my opinion, is one of the best vr games to date and is an even better experience on Oculus Quest. Even after finishing the game, playing the challenges are fun too and give you something else to do when the main game is over. Overall a great game and definitely one of the first games to get on any vr system.\n\nHelpful | 1", "RyanGZB16 days ago\nAmazing game! A must have!\n\nWhile the graphics and red models put me off buying it at first, once you start playing you actually enjoy them.\n\nOnce you start playing you will quickly start to hate this game, but you wont be able to stop playing. Took me a few minutes to pick up the grab mechanics but once youve done it once or twice youll be an expert.\n\nThe levels are all enjoyable, great fun and annoying. Some levels I had to repeat over and over, many times because I kept getting shot - but it was so much fun. It was so fun finding new ways to do each level when my original way wasnt working out. Finding something else to throw, or realising there was a gun behind me the whole time!\n\nThe main campaign is pretty short to be honest, there is some replay-ability with additional modifiers you can add at the end.\n\nThis game is a must have for any VR user, its basic and gets you used to playing with VR, and also great fun.\n\nHelpful | 0", "maddog102016 days ago\nThe best game I have ever played\n\nThis is the best game I have ever played on VR and probably will be for the rest of the time I own this oculus. I feel this game is basically the reason why VR and oculus were made. P.S. if you do not like shooting games this might not be for you but if you like shooting games and defending yourself in a tense situation then this is your game. I was literally crawling on the floor dodging bullets and I have carpet burn but it was definitely worth it. Love it, you should get it\n\nHelpful | 1", "brandon.migliorisi17 days ago\nSuper Awesome!\n\nThis is one experience you cant afford to miss out on as an Oculus Quest owner. Its all the action anyone could ever ask for, but with the added element of time control. A bizarre feeling to see your enemy stop when you stop. Not to mention is can be very difficult to train yourself to slow down when things get intense.\nToo good to miss!\n\nHelpful | 1", "HapleousJul 15 at 7:24 PM\nBeautifully Executed\n\nThe original introduced a cool concept, which is brought to life in the VR version. While lacking in the story of the PC version, just the perfect execution of the time only moves when you move makes this must-have for your games library. The way it runs is just so smooth, and it was a lot of fun throughout the levels.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Ertiupoip4 days ago\nOutgunned outmatched but not out of time\n\nIt's amazing!

The feeling of dodging bullets or slicing them in half is something straight from the Matrix, and it really does feel good. The game focuses on violence, but with no blood, no screams, and still realistic gameplay physics. If you want to buy this game, do it.

This game has unbelievable replayability. The main story isn't as detailed as the original (I played both yay) but just go watch game theory or something to understand the lore. But what it lacks in story it makes up in gameplay, it's so satisfying to land a headshot or land several shots with an Uzi. I also love all the new weapons they added and variety was a big thing the original lacked. In conclusion this John Wick/Matrix combination works perfectly in VR, I 100% recommend this game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "TaysiaBrayshawJul 1 at 3:28 PM\nIncredible VR experience\n\nIf you are just starting out on VR this is a fantastic game! I can't speak for the VR veterans because I'm not one but the way time moves when you move is an amazing concept that makes for tactical full body game play. Added bonus of feeling like you're in the matrix when you dodge bullets. Would highly recommend.\n\nHelpful | 3", "rustfy8 days ago\nPretty fun game\n\nThe game is by far one of the top games on the quest and the graphics are optimized to look amazing on a mobile processor, would recommend this to anyone new to vr and vr veterans\n\nHelpful | 1", "Sydney_RobsterJul 26 at 10:05 PM\nt's HOT\n\nI played this first on Xbox and I really enjoyed it. Not so much on Quest, but that may be because I was replaying it, and also because I couldn't freeroam (you movenemt is restricted to your room's space).

This review is meant to help people who are thinking about buying this game but have reservations about the suicide in it, and/or to inform people about that suicide being in the game.\n\nZeroth: The following review contains very minor spoilers.\n\nFirst: You can turn these segments of the game off in the settings you can go into as the game loads. Do so if you need to. These segments of the game are very infrequent and turning them off will not harm your enjoyment of the game or reduce the amount of content you get.\n\nSecond: While it is a questionable stylistic choice to include these segments, it is in keeping with the overall theme the game has. It isn't just a casual relationship with suicide, it is part of the reality of what you are doing in the game. In fact, they aren't even really suicides if you stop and think about what's actually happening in the story. As to if that is better or worse, you'll have to decide.\n\nThird: The game is absolutely amazing. If you've ever wanted to feel like an action film star without having to be one, this is the game for you. It is a puzzle game. Every encounter can be solved by clearly and methodically thinking your way through what you are seeing. You don't need to move quickly, twitch skills actively work against success. Stay calm. Stay centered. Be aware of your surroundings. There simply is no better experience in VR, even in 2020 as I write this.\n\nFourth: The graphics are minimalist. If you are looking at the preview video, that's what you get. There is no hidden amazing section of high graphical fidelity. If that's all you care about, skip this game. Your loss, though.\n\nFifth: This doesn't mean the game is without faults. It can be completed in a few hours and the post-game content isn't great. It could stand with some better options for endless mode.\n\nHelpful | 817", "Trixster6d9Jun 3 at 8:29 PM\nJust buy it....\n\nBuy it....

The gameplay is awesome and the story surprisingly intriguing.\nOverall it's a cool experience especially if you're new to VR and it is held up by it's really solid gameplay. This game deserves all the praise it has gotten.

After beating the main game, which unfortunately took me only about 3 days to finish, there is still a considerable amount of replay value, with different challenges and collectibles to complete.

The game is unlike any other VR game in the sense that every movement you make matters and so as you are immersed in this world were movement its flashing and different and other worldly, it is also your biggest liability.

When making the level you choose were you start and build around you with wall props buildings and even an interior. There you can place enemies and when they come give them weapons and even armour and place weapons around, then put the levels in an order beat it and post it. You should have a floppy disc that takes you to a interface in front of you and you can play your levels and other people's levels.

From beginning to end new guns, mechanics and encounters are introduced from the simple punching to the timed and precise gun firings, this game is a masterpiece.

I chose this game because I had played the xbox one version of it already and had a ton of fun playing on the xbox. I really wasn't sure what to expect with this being my very first VR experience but my friend and I decided to jump in and see what virtual reality was all about.\n\nLet me tell you...there are very few times in my life that have been more exhilarating than cutting bullets in half mid-air with blades or dodging them in slow-mo as they graze past my face in Super Hot. Whoever saw this game on console platform and decided to figure out how to bring it to VR is a freakin GENIUS (I'm pretty sure that's the correct chronological order of this game anyways).\n\nAs I've seen a few other reviews say, this is indeed an action/puzzle type game. Fast-twitch movements may feel necessary at first due to blades and bullets constantly flying at you, but this actually hurts more than it helps. Utilizing the slow motion/time-stopping ability to see what moves you need to make next is paramount to success here (there's a bullet flying at my head so I need to dodge that...but by the time I do that red guy will have fired again. But slightly to my left is a gun a previous bad guy dropped when I killed him...so by leaning left I can pick that gun up and simultaneously dodge the incoming bullet while being ready for the next one). And that's just one scenario off the top of my head!\n\nOne minor issue with this game is replay ability. Don't get me wrong I've beat the story mode 3 times and done each of the Endless maps probably 20 times a piece trying to beat my previous high scores. The problem is you'll notice that the bad guys spawn in pretty much the same spots every time so repetition can start to wear on you a bit. But now worries...just set the game down for the night and the next day it will be just as fun in my experience!\n\n*Slight spoiler but also important to note*\n\nI've also seen many complaints about the \"suicide theme\" in the game. I understand where these people are coming from. But looking at it that way is a very shallow perspective in my opinion. It's not an encouragement of the idea of killing yourself...rather the computer system in the story begins to \"infect\" your mind and try to persuade you to \"free your mind by destroying your bodily form which is enslaving the abilities of your mind\" Yes it may still sound like a suicidal theme...but it's very clear that's not at all the intent if you pay attention to the story itself.\n\nAfter all...Mind Is Software \n\nHelpful | 4", "Raxsha3 days ago\nDidn't get refund from them\n\nI only had my oculus for 14 days, and had the game for 10 days.

Obviously, as has been stated in every review going, not having the wires in this game is so much better. Im not sure about everyone else but when I get toward the later rounds, you pretty much need to be able to roll around.

Slick, minimalist audio and visuals. Thrilling slow motion shooting that's perfect for VR, and some very well laid out levels that are at times tough, but satisfying to get the better of.\n\nMinor criticisms; the way levels are structured (you have to play through a few consecutive scenarios to advance) can be a bit frustrating. If you die at the final hurdle, you go all the way back to the start. I know that's the norm for a game, but in this case the opening segments can he very easy, so it feels a bit like menial time-killing to just go through them again in order to get to where you previously died.\n\nAlso the throwing.

I find myself flinching in real life and trying to find new ways to finish each level, and feeling like an absolute GOD while controlling time. It is an absolute 5 star game, but the VR experience itself on Quest, in my opinion, is a 3-4 star one. The issue I ran into is a very annoying one, and almost experience breaking. I'll try my best to describe it.\n\nWhen you finish a scene, and it moves you to the next one, it treats wherever you're standing at the transition as the centre of your play zone. You could be at the very edge of your guardian boundary and it would automatically reset your centre to where you are, meaning you're constantly reaching outside of it, even in a large space.\n\nIn the PCVR version, before each transition, you were required to walk back to your centre and grab the pyramid. This one does it automatically which you'd think would make the immersion better, but it actually costs it a lot when you're constantly having to move back to your centre on your own, either using pass through or by peaking out under the headset, and recentring by holding the oculus button, almost every single transition (especially if you're in a smaller play space.)\n\nIf this was fixed, it would be 100% 5 stars and I would recommend everyone to buy it without hesitation. However, because of this experience breaking bug, I'd have to warn people first, and straight up not recommend it for Quest users in a small space.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Captain_CATlassMay 23 at 1:52 AM\nEverything has already been said....\n\nSUPERHOT VR really is an amazing game, and I know everybody says it but it really is like being in the Matrix.

Headshots only is hard, adds an extra level of precision. My personal favourite is Don't Die.\nIt's a mode where you have to play through some levels of the game, and if you die on any of them, you get sent back to the start. Once you complete these though, there is not a whole lot else to do.\n\nThat being said, I still adore the game. The time/moving thing is brilliant.

I dont wanna say much because you should try it for yourself :) but it can put you in a workout. I sweat so much playing this game and it doesnt hurt the oculus but just dont get it on the lenses. This game can go in slow motion which will help you a lot and without it I feel the game is impossible to beat. This game is also really confusing. When you load it up, your place in the action, after passing stages you are put in the room but I wont describe it.

People also complain about it not downloading when that is probably them just out of space. Also, someone said it said it says purchased and they cant download it. Just go to library, not installed, and its RIGHT THERE. Most people complain about things that are their fault or the Oculus doing what it was meant to do. Anyway, this game is INSANE. I played the console version and when I got the Oculus, I knew I had to get the VR version. The best part is the levels arent the same because on console you move around. This felt like an entirely different game, but it was made from the same idea. Sort of like a sequel that is better than the original. The VR version is a different experience and you should get this version and the console version. The VR version is more immersive while the console version is more like you are trapped in a prison or a loop. Either way, both games are amazing and I urge you to play this game if you have any VR headset.

The game is totally focused on its core idea of slowed-time action, and is very effective at that.\nSomehow, regrettably, I skipped the original non-VR game, but playing this VR title I really feel it is the perfect match. Superhot VR is one of the best and most effective uses of VR, and VR is the best platform for Superhot. So much so, that I actually feel less interested in playing the original non-VR title now. IMO, the developers should re-issue the original title in VR, with movement using the thumb joysticks.\nI have just finished the game and I do feel it was a little short (but still satisfyingly intensive). Good thing there are these alt modes now (Endless, Headshot, etc). Let's see if I have the guts to try them...\nAnyway, to sum up, it's a must buy. Period.

Not only does it have a 2 hour long story mode that will make you rage quit every time you die and have a celebration every time you complete one of Superhot's intense and fun challenges! I was worried that when I completed the game, there will be nothing to do but I was wrong. After you complete the insanely amazing story mode, you will have different modes to play such as: Endless Mode, Speedrun Mode, Headshots only mode and more! I would really love if they added a practice mode where the bad guys stand still and you can use all the weapons against them because who doesn't love watching your enemies head explode! This is also the right game if you want a workout. I was sweating by disk 2 and would have completely exhausted if I didn't take two breaks. The levels are sometimes difficult and it will make you very mad (I was mad at the \"The Pyramid\" level and spent 20 minutes alone trying to beat that.) Don't make the games difficulty stop you because when you beat it you will get a great sense of accomplishment and it will be the best thing you have completed in your life! I can keep on writing reasons why this game is great but I have things to do (Like scoring the best highscore on Endless mode!) Last thing, I haven't encountered any bugs in my time playing the game!

I played the original title on xbox and moving over to vr was ming blowing. I will say the xbox has more campaign levels but the vr levels are geared towards vr in such an amazing immersive way that it completely makes up for it. Plus alt modes (Unlocked after campaign completion) make sure you never run out of fun content. The physics of the game are incredibly fun(I personally love flipping the guns and knifes in slow motion mid fights) only down side is on the xbox after you finished a level it played back your actions in real time, so if you set up a really cool slow motion chain kill that round it looks like your killing the bad guys like a ninja in real time afterwards (imagine 10 minutes of slow motion planning out a sick chain kill displayed in 30 seconds... its breathtaking) i can see how it might be a struggle to implement it into a vr based game but hoping they'll devs will figure it out in a later update. In my opinion they have already gone above and beyond with a simple indie to make it such an amazing immersive game.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good experience, however, it's not all that different from regular SUPERHOT. It feels like a few extra levels with some fancy tech, not a stand-alone game. It's far too similar to the original and adds nothing to the formula other than the obvious inclusion of VR.\n\nThe game is also ridiculously short. The original was also fairly short, so I wasn't expecting much, but apparently, I still overestimated. I've probably only spent a few hours playing through the story, however, that was including all my mistakes. If I hadn't died once, I imagine I could've to beat the game in 30 minutes.\n\nAlright, so the game is short? So what? There were plenty of bonus game modes in the original, so why the fuss? Well, SH VR lacks most of those unique game modes. I can understand why they'd remove most of them, as the limitations on movement would ruin many of them, however, the introduction of VR adds many new opportunities, which the devs never take.\n\nThere is one specific weapon that I seriously miss. One that is a signature of the franchise, but was removed, despite being fully functional. Why would you remove the katana? A sword can be welded in one hand, so why remove something so iconic? Why does ever weapon need to be so small? Why does it seem like the devs don't want to experiment with levels and mechanics revolving around VR? Items such as shields could never work on PC, so why is a frying pan the best you can get?\n\nThis is something designed to showcase VR, not a $25 game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "kldeleo1Apr 16 at 4:55 AM\nProbably the best game on vr\n\nIts so cool I recommend this game \n\nHelpful | 0", "sardonicesqueFeb 25 at 3:48 AM\nGreat game for me that came with a cost\n\nFirst of all, this game is amazing.

The fact that you got to punch and shoot those red guys as if it were a real life scenario, and I also like the little Easter egg which is when you get a achievement, a little post it note falls down from the sky with a little picture and the name of the achievement you got.

So you can plan all your moves in sequence, then execute them.\n\nExcept it's never that easy - because once you start moving *everything* starts moving - bullets, knives, throwing stars and so on. So you have to time everything to perfection - one hit, and you die and everything resets and you have to start again.\n\nIt is the most frustrating game I have played in a while but that is what makes it so much fun.

Above Vader immortal, above beat saber, above any game currently on the quest. This game serves as the quintessential oculus quest pick. They did a campaign, they did an endless mode, they did challenges, they did everything that other VR games seem to be lacking, and they did it well. If youre going to get one game on VR, its gotta be this one. I personally purchased my quest to experience this game in virtual reality (which was also my first time playing the game in general) and was blown away. Every friend I show it to loses their mind and that joy they experience for the first time is always exciting to watch. Cant recommend enough, they truly outdid themselves.

Advancing time when you physically move is a really cool idea, and I loved how this game really shows off \"VR presence\" and gives you the feeling that you are inhabiting another place and interacting with the environment. Replayability is high with this game too, especially with the different game modes that are unlocked when you finish the 19 level \"campaign\".

It's like watching Fast & Furious and realizing at the end you could've watched another hour of it. For Super Hot, just as you master the art of moving around in bullet time, it's over.

Those are short moments in the overall scope of the game... true, but they kind of sapped some of the fun out of it for me.

The core mechanics are simple yet the way you are tasked in the game makes it difficult and complex, yet completely fair. Though, even with this being said, the game was not perfect. It was just missing something that was unobtainable due simply to the system the game was for.\nVR gave the game what it was missing. While the devs could have pretty easily treated this the way Fallout 4 and Skyrim were (that being how they were just ported into VR), they built a new game from the ground up, while keeping the exact same wonderful feel of playing Superhot by keeping the aforementioned mechanics. This could easily be considered a full fledged sequel, rather than just it being known as \"Superhot VR\". By giving you the base mechanics of this game but also the ability to move as if you were your character, it pushes the game to its peak. Instead of moving a thumbstick to the left to just move out of the way of bullets, you actually dodge said bullets. This alone is one of the most amazing parts of the game, because it really puts you into the world. I found myself trying to kick enemies and then realizing that's not possible. The game draws you in with its simple mechanics and gun play, and then once you're there, hits you with the complex presentation, similar to how they did in the first game, but it is instantaneously better because of one simple reason-It's in VR.\nIn conclusion, Superhot VR is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a very long time. Whether you have played the original or not, get this one.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\nHelpful | 30", "tajinder.shergill.16Feb 22 at 9:50 AM\nReally good\n\nIts amazing I Remember seeing matrix and being like I want to do that and be like neo and this game forfilled my dream but it now to be in the matrix of feel like you are there\n\nHelpful | 0", "chaderrMar 8 at 9:43 AM\nHard ,but fun\n\nthis game is the ultimate rage game but when you beat the level you get a major sense of accomplishment.\n\nHelpful | 0", "squish0412Feb 18 at 3:30 PM\nIts perfect\n\nIt keeps me entertained for hours even when I dont think its hours.

As my first shooter experience in VR, I can say that SUPERHOT would easily receive 5 stars from me if it wasnt for the few issues I experienced.\n\nSometimes the hit detection on myself and enemies seemed off, not consistently but enough to be noticeable. I could fire at an enemy and miss but the bullet would go past them closely and still be considered a hit. This could be considered as the game being forgiving but I am very observant and would always look to make sure I hit the enemy which is why I noticed this and found it slightly jarring. The same went with enemies firing at you, sometimes you would feel as though you were definitely not gonna be hit but still were which could be quite frustrating at times. Very minor but I feel as though its important for me to mention.\n\nI often felt disoriented when the next scene of a level was loaded as all it takes to position you is where you are looking, to counter this I made sure to quickly look in the most comfortable position in my play area just before the next scene triggered. This could be just because of my situation with a smaller play area.\n\nDespite the extra modes offered after completion, the game feels pretty short for the price tag but I may feel this way only because I had previously played the game.\n\nLastly, the story felt very underdeveloped due to the length of the game but still likely understandable to most who play if you pay attention to all the messages the game conveys.\n\nBesides these gripes, I can wholeheartedly recommend this gem of a VR experience, I wont spoil much here but Id like to mention to anyone looking to purchase the game...that you very much should, no matter your previous experience with shooters!\n\nHelpful | 0", "ItxBenJun 6 at 1:20 PM\nGreat!\n\nGot it for my birthday, a truly GREAT game!!

Very fun to play with a friend or by yourself even though this is a one player game. You can jump duck move side to side and not every level is the same with new levels to accomplish and challenges along with achievements. Every time you move time speeds up the first to move the first your time is and it really makes you feel like youre in the game. Red guys are bad everything thats not read is good even know there are only two colors in the game besides the weapons, which is red and white. I would rate this game five stars because its only $25 you can play it over again and its Super simple you just put the disk or the little card in to the slot and put the headset on even though youre already wearing a headset LOL and then youre just in the game and the graphics are accurate to how your movements are soIt works out. If you dont buy this game I dont know what youre doing because its only $25 on the few gigabytes and is in my opinion the best or one of the best ever so far this is 1/14/2020. This is the first game I bought and I know I dont have that much experience but I know that the other free games dont compare to this.\n\nHelpful | 0", "colejoerJun 3 at 3:40 PM\nSuperhot Vr\n\nBest VR game on the quest store at the moment, perfect use of VR mechanics to make a game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "alan.braidwoodMay 26 at 1:06 PM\nWaw\n\nAny 'top 10' list of Oculus games has this game at #1, and it deserves to be.

A lot of the levels will require multiple attempts to learn the enemy patterns, although they do often slightly change their paths/actions etc, so don't expect to just walk through beating every level first time.

Your room in the game is really small but when you are in the virtual world you can walk around freely.

One of the most annoying things about this game on the Rift was the wire. I kept tripping and getting tangled up, making it harder to dodge bullets and pick up weapons. The Quest completely gets rid of this problem. Insight works perfect for this game, almost like it was designed for it.\n\nGameplay wise, I loved this game. The mechanics work so well, and the graphics are beautiful. It feels so satisfying when you finally beat the level youve been struggling with for so long. I had no idea how they would manage to convert freezing time by not moving to VR. They not only did it, they nailed it. For the most part, tracking worked great for me, and I usually experienced no lag. It crashed only once, and it was probably just my Quest glitching.

Occasionally you see a bullet coming towards you head-on and when it happens, it feels like youre about to die. As for the graphics, its a thing of beauty just to pause and look around occasionally. All backgrounds being ice-white with light shades of grey is a perfect example of less is more.

When you die you have to start back at the first level in the set. This feels like its done purely to extend the life of the game because it has so little content. You do get some decent replayability options after you've completed it but you already spent the majority of your first play through replaying the same levels over and over. The game does provide one mode though where you try to kill as many enemies as you can within one area. I was hoping the demo was just a snippet of a grander picture but it wasn't.

My only criticism, which I see mentioned more than once throughout the other reviews, is that the game can be completed in just a few hours and is sort of anticlimactic when the player wins. There is potential to creatively continue the story. Another thing that can be annoying, but makes this game so good, is that there is no way at all to adjust difficulty.

Dont be mislead by 2d trailer as the game looks much better in VR. The simplified graphics dont detract from the awesome game play. Might be the most addictive game Ive ever played. Collision detection seems improved since the latest update. Lots of replay ability but youll have to complete 19 levels first to unlock different modes including guest mode. That allows a guest to start their own game. You can also now chose any scenario or play with different conditions such as head shots only, speed runs, endless and more. Maybe levels should be unlocked as you complete them like in Drop Dead but this set up did give me more motivation to complete the 19 levels and it isnt too hard to do so. Takes about two hours. Someone complained getting started wasnt intuitive. You have to put a disk in a computer and put on a VR headset hanging overhead. Whats so hard about that? They even prompt you! How did they ever get past First Steps? So this Pistol Whip and Drop Dead are the best games Ive played on the quest so far. You must own it. You wont regret anything about it except for the many hours of your life you will lose playing it. Ive been playing for six months now and still not tired of it.

The fix was to simply designate a smaller, square start area - but - I would really like to see an improvement here - perhaps a option to recenter on death and the ability to do snap/smooth turning? More minor issue is that hitboxes seem a little oversized and underdetailed (ie. no holes)\n\nI don't think those issues are a huge hamper on gameplay however, as you'll learn to avoid/fix them pretty quick.

Or John Wick. Or Liam Neeson in the Taken films. Youre dropped into a room, theres bad guys and you have to use what you can to dispatch them. Simple as that.

I worked out that when you press A+X buttons on startup to enter 'bios' you then have 3 different save slots to choose. In PC Room I have to hold the helmet with one hand and insert disk with other to enter game. When I got half way through the levels (initial campaign), I end up back in the PC room, choosing the Superhot disk gives me access to any level. However I just wanted to play straight through all the levels in order without interruption. I had no idea which levels I had or hadn't done, so had to enter a few then exit to work out where I'd got to. I have no idea if there was a plot line? I would have preferred being placed in a normal enemy room with 5 different enemies moving toward me and each holding a disk that I shot, grabbed the disk they released, inserted it into a pc as the method to select different options, rather than entering some room with old PC's and putting on a helmet that breaks the immersion and continuity IMO. I'm not usually a PC gamer, just someone wanting to experience VR, arcade style, so any awkwardness or hassle is a killer.\nBTW the FAQ has no useful info.

I do not want my kids at any age simulating holding a gun to their head and pulling a trigger. One thing to think you're playing against fake avatars and shooting guns. Quite another to hold a VR pistol at your own head and pull a trigger. This SHOULD NOT be rated for anyone 10+ because of this scene alone. Had I known this scene were in it I NEVER would have purchased this game. Sad I wasted $30 on it. Take this scene out and it's an amazing game.

There is nothing like it\n\nConcept is simple.\n\nYou are dropped into the middle of an action scenario, usually surrounded by bad guys.\n\nTime stops when you stop, time moves when you move, this lets you dodge bullets, punches, make impossible shots, and is the core concept of the game. This is what makes you feel like Neo.\n\nUse Pistols, Uzis, Shotguns, bottles, combat knives, cleavers, ash trays, billiard balls, cameras, ninja stars, mind powers and calculators to eliminate your enemies until none remain.\n\nAnd thats about it. I shudder to think of what would happen if a strong, overt narrative was placed over such insane mechanics. This could change the game.\n\nTips For Playing\n\n1. Use a big space, you will be ducking behind barrels, crawling under office desks, peaking around pool tables, and maneuvering within store fronts and pizza shop kitchen, your gonna need the space.\n\n2. Block bullets with objects to save yourself. Some objects break, others don't, and others still do a little better than just block, but I'll let you discover that part. Point is, block with stuff you pick up, it will save your life.\n\n3. When you've run out of bullets, bottles, knives, and other stuff to throw, do not forget to resort to your Mind Powers, if you have progressed far enough in the game to get them.

The ability to throw anything to kill enemies.\n-Stylistic/Unique visuals: if something is red, shoot it. If it's black, pick it up.\n-Extra game modes at the end of the game add a lot, including a Guest mode, which allows others to play on my Oculus Quest, and not delete my progress. I wish other games had this feature.\n\n\nCons:\n-The game is rather short, I'd say it took me about 2-3 hours when I was taking my time and enjoying the game to the fullest.\n-Occasionally, you'll die to a bullet that really shouldn't have hit you.

The reviews here speak volumes, but....it has issues that need addressing. Firstly the saves. Why only 3 save slots? My friends and family want a go and that does make it awkward. Yes, I know there is a guest floppy disk in the main room but more save slots please so I can showcase this to others! Why do we have to press A+X to access the saves? It would have been better to have the multiple floppy discs in the main room to select. Secondly, you do need a big room to play this. My living room isn't small by any means but I've already punched my radiator rather hard despite setting the guardian. You need some serious room to play this properly as you will be ducking and diving around on the floor. Lastly, the graphics. I know its supposed to look this way and its sort of cool......for a few mins then it gets a bit dull as it all looks the same.

If you are new to virtual reality and are looking for games to get, then consider this rating as a 5/5. You need this game and theres a reason why it is in the Oculus Quest Essensials List.\n\nI am in the speedrunning community of this game. I love doing the real time speedrun disc and submitting runs of the entire game on speedrun.com, but in these speedruns is where the bad happens. Keep in mind that if you are playing casually and you ARENT going as fast as you possibly can, 98.6 percent of the time you will not run into these problems. I am only covering the 1.4 percent.\n\n1. AI. The AI can be really dumb sometimes. Okay, sometimes is a VERY generous word, but I have been softlocked so many times and had to reboot the game because in cage fight or another level where I dont have any throwables or guns left, the ai literally back away from me for eternity. The ai literally can hide behind objects forever. This is incredibly annoying when you are replaying the game over, and over, and over again.\n\n2. How most of the time when you throw an object at a red guy they sometimes dont die. Okay with the amount of times I have experienced this sometimes is again, a VERY generous word to use. When I throw like a shuriken in the throwing tutorial at the beginning, sometimes they dont die. Other times if they do die , they kill me before they actually die. Which them being dead doesnt matter if Im dead.\n\nThere are tons of other problems like how the red guys walk depending on if you hold a gun or are holding nothing, which can again lead to another soft lock, but Im not gonna get into that.\n\nOther than that I love this game and theres a reason I always come back to speedrun it.

Playing without a cord in a large play area allows for you to move around the arena with complete immersion.

One level is slightly broken; at the end of one set of challenges you have to look at a very specific spot in the level in order to progress, which in the context of the level makes makes no sense (I wont give any level detail here as to not spoil it for yall).\n\nIf that were all, I would have given it four stars. I took off another star because it deals with suicide lightly. It uses player-suicide in a lets be edgy kind of way, just like how a twelve year-old drops the f-bomb just to get a reaction. Historically, media has had a real, proven effect on suicide rates, and I felt the game makers were either oblivious or apathetic to this, which is inexcusable, especially for a medium as interactive as VR.\n\nAlso, I like to share my Quest with my friends, and this game really is not one easily shared (compared to Beat Saber).\n\nHelpful | 1", "UCN_LeftyOct 24 at 10:51 AM\nBrilliant\n\nVery fun game\n\nHelpful | 0", "Eo1grahamOct 10 at 10:49 AM\n\nLoaded!!!

Its about as much fun as a 1985 Commodore 64 game costing $2.95. Ill keep trying it because there HAS to be some huge piece of the gameplay Im missing. What Ive seen in my 30 minute first try is pretty close to an out and out scam. I have hundreds of Oculus games and Ive never asked for a refund on a single one, not even the obvious clunkers.

I did battle in a kitchen and in an airplane just to name a couple.\n\nThis game is so much fun and if you don't play it you are seriously missing out.\n\nOnly part I'd ask devs to improve is when you grab the pyramid at the end of each level, your spawn point was not consistent and sometimes if you spawned in the wrong place it put you at disadvantage.\n\nThere are a bunch of new play modes once you beat the game and I enjoy going back to play endless mode or replay my favorite levels on occasion.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJul 15, 2019 at 7:10 AM\n\nIf you happen to take any footage of the spawning issue, please send it to us at superhot@superhotgame.com.

The possibilities are endless! That bottle over there? A deadly projectile in YOUR hands. The ash tray on that table right there? A perfect shield to toss and deflect a bullet. Dude coming in \"Super Hot\" with a knife? (See what I did there? Eh?) Pretend you're Kano from Mortal Kombat and do a fatality before they knew what was coming (I got a little carried away). That's what's great about this game though, I can always find some exciting, and hilarious, ways of dispatching my foes and learning how the levels work to maximize creativity. I did have a slight issue with the guardian system and level sync but it was very rare and often could be worked around. Another downside was figuring out how to start new game's (so friend's and family could try). From what I've gathered (so don't quote me), unless you complete the entire game you will not be greeted with a menu screen upon restarting the game. I, for example, get placed back at my current level as soon as the game starts up and needless to say, someone new shouldn't be playing a near end game level. The way around this? While the game is booting up, you'll be prompted to hold A and X for the setup menu. Once you're there, you'll find save file options. Simply select a new save file and it'll start a fresh game!

You dont need to move further than the room you are in, but movement is absolutely essential to gameplay. Its almost like this game was made for Quest. I cant imagine playing with wires because I was spinning around like crazy.\nThis game is also great to watch other people play, because you have to make these crazy contortionist moves in the game to stay alive, which looks like some sort of bizarre interpretive dance.\nThe immersion is off the charts.

(Force closing)\n\nSuper hot is an excellent game that is available across many platforms. The experience on a console compared to a VR setup is wildly different. However, super hot on the oculus quest does not provide the consistency in game play as it does in other venues. The game struggles to work on the Quest, often coming to a forced close within a few minutes of gameplay. For this reason, Quest users should hold off on purchasing the game until the issue is resolved.\n\nHelpful | 6", "PossumMan500Jun 27, 2019 at 2:40 PM\nTruly unique and fantastic game, but.\n\nThis is a really awesome game when you get into it. I recommend getting a pair of decent headphones as the sound effects just aren't punchy enough with the quest speakers alone. Other games are fine though, superhot just seems quite quiet. I feel like you could have better gun sound effects too. I have experienced problems though. At least 3 crashes where I cannot do anything other than exit the game and reload it. As everyone else said, it seems silly you cant just start a new game just to show people what it's like. Also when you pick up a disk in the room where you put your headset on, it seems very odd you cant put a disk down and it is glued to your hand. Did the developers think people wouldn't pick up on this or something? Just seems lazy. Also when you have completed the game and you unlock everything, the user interface is just very sloppy as it's not clear what is what. It's very short considering it was 20, do you think more levels and weapons may get released? I don't feel I got bang for my buck as it feels about 10/12, not 20.\n\n** coming back to it, we spoke they listened.

This is a issue because if people are coming over and they are about to try the Quest, its just a big mess. They have no idea what to do, and therefore it really is not that much fun, especially because there are other games that at least will have a tutorial they can try before playing the game.

The wireless 6DoF combined with the time show mechanic creates a beautiful shooter that I'd play for hours; \"wish\" being the key word, because the campaign for this game is absurdly short. With 1-2 hours of play time depending on your skill level, it feels as if just when you get hooked the story ends. This shortened playtime is especially apparent when you compare it to the PC version of the game, which has a more fleshed out story, and gives the game room to grow.\nThe second flaw is the menu. You only unlock the option to do anything other than the main story after you beat the game, and then the menu is extremely confusing once you get to it.\nMy third problem with the game is the level design. By keeping the player mainly stationary with the exception of dodging bullets, it's time slow mechanic is underutilized compared to the base game, which has you actually moving through the levels.\nAll in all, this game on the Quest is a downgrade from the base non-VR game, but a major upgrade from any other VR version of it. A couple little additional downsides are sprinkled here and there, including the baffling absence of the body swap mechanic, replaced by an insta kill button, and a couple other little things.

The User interface is a mess, it works with a series of floppy disks that you have to insert to play and a mock VR headset that gets stuck on the ceiling so you have to jump to get in the levels. Theres no clear list of levels or sense of progress, in between levels you are stuck in this tiny room that looks like youve been kidnapped and has no options, settings or a way to choose your levels, saves or user profile. That room you cannot tell which objects are interactive so you spend a good time touching things, once you get a hold of a floppy disk its glued to your hand.

The gameplay is tested, solid, and if you never played it before, its worth it. Unfortunately I believe the VR version is pretty much inferior to the original non-VR pc version, regardless of the headset you play on.\n\nThis version is missing any sort of locomotion and even if you can still move around with your body (assuming you have enough space...), the game is clearly designed to keep you playing inside a very small area. This limits a lot the possibilities in the combat, and level design gets really repetitive as a consequence.\n\nThen, the dark, cool story from the original version and the even cooler DOS-like menus and extras are totally missing, making the game feel quite dull at times. You need to finish the campaign (19 stages, 1 hour more or less) to replay levels, and even after that, the additional modes can be interesting only to people who didnt already play on pc.\n\nThe game is still a very good, clean and smooth VR experience, but knowing how good the original PC version is, Im just left wanting for more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "robotlasereyesMay 30, 2019 at 4:57 PM\nGood Buy\n\nI got this as one of my first games on the headset and it is by far one of the best experiences you can get\n\nHelpful | 0", "AJailaniMay 23, 2019 at 2:33 PM\nTop Reasons to get a VR\n\nOne of the best game I looked forward to get into VR and with the Quest it did not disappoint!

I heavily would not recommend this games to players with little space to move, as many sequences are genuinely impossible without having to quickly move three feet in any given direction. And I mean any given direction, including down, as you will find yourself surrounded by so many bullets to dodge you feel more like your taking a Yoga class than moving like John Wick, and it does not help that bullets fired by you are often inaccurate against moving targets, ensuring you rarely ever get headshots from far away, or any shot on the enemy on the first shot at all. Speaking of accuracy, throwing stuff makes you feel like your hands are blindfolded, as I have found that no matter how straight my angle was, the gun/knife/ashtray I threw would always just miss the enemy by hitting the ground/ceiling/air near him. This is frustrating when the game puts you in sequences where you have no guns and have to throw stuff, forcing to wait for gun-weilding enemies to get close enough for you not to miss, which often ends in very dumb deaths. And I found most of my deaths to be dumb, as I would be killed by bullets that I could swore just passed me, bullets that gained an abrupt burst of speed towards my face just from turning around to face it, bullets that went through some pieces of cover to hit me, and bullets that surrounded me with absolutely no hope of me doing an upward dog to dodge it, usually at the last set-piece before a checkpoint, forcing me to do that upward dog again.\n\nIf you loved Superhot VR on PC or PSVR, this will be a dream port that's worth the money to buy it again, without risk of tearing your teather into several pieces.\nIf you haven't physically played Superhot VR before and have a noticeably hard time doing more than 5 squats every minute, this game becomes significantly harder to recommend.\n\nHelpful | 8", "DAX_QcJun 2, 2019 at 5:16 PM\n5*\n\nShut up and buy it!\n\nHelpful | 1", "sage.bond.2000May 27, 2019 at 12:35 AM\nVery nice game.\n\nYou can play this game over and over again.
