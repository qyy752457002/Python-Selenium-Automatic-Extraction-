Before using or submitting information to the Services please review this Privacy Policy carefully, as well as the terms of use related to each of the specific Services, which governs your use of the Services. A specific Service may have additional terms and policies regarding privacy for that specific Service, so in that instance, those additional privacy terms and policies will also apply.

If you dont want to allow a social network to share such information with\n\nVertigo and other third parties, please review the privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you connect your Member account with your social network account.\n\n3. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES\n\nVertigo may allow third parties to display or provide Advertisements, Content, Promotions or other services on or through a particular Service, such as, for example, our website. Vertigo, its partners and/or advertisers, or social networks, may use third party servers to serve or present the Advertisements, Content, Promotions or the Services and to conduct research about the Advertisements, Content, Promotions or Services. Any of these third party servers may collect non-personal information, such as your browser, operating system, date/time of viewing, IP address, device ID, or clickstream data. Vertigo cannot control the activities of such third parties, websites or social networks.\n\nFurthermore, Vertigo may use third party services to enable online purchasing or e-commerce functionality, which involves the sale of Vertigos or third party products and services. These third party services may provide credit card or other payment processing services where they collect Personal Information and other financial information from you.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICES, SERVERS OR SOCIAL NETWORKS. PLEASE REFER THE PRIVACY POLICIES OF EACH SUCH THIRD PARTY.\n\n4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES\n\nVertigo or its third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and Web Beacons, to collect information about users who visit or use the Services and view or interact with Advertisements, Content, and Promotions.\n\nCookies.Vertigo uses cookies to help you access and navigate the Services more efficiently and to statistically monitor how many people are using a Service.\n\na. A cookie is a small file or tool stored on your computer or device containing information that allows Vertigo to deliver customized information to you. Vertigo uses both session and persistent cookies on the Services. Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer or device. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive (or other storage media) of your computer or device and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer or device for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of a Service you find most valuable and customizing such Service based on your preferences on an ongoing basis.\n\nb. You may set your browser to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies. Certain features of a Service, including certain Content, or Promotions, may not, however, function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites or mobile versions of such sites anonymously. While Vertigo will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if Vertigo cannot recognize you, Vertigo wants you to be aware that these programs are available.\n\nWeb Beacons.During your use of a Service, you may encounter Web Beacons, which may come from Vertigo or from third parties that display or provide Advertisements, Content, or Promotions or services on such Service.\n\na. A Web Beacon (sometimes also called a web bug or clear gif) is a small graphic image in a web page, a web-based document or an e-mail message that generally allows the party that set the Web Beacon to monitor certain information about the viewer of the web page, web-based document or e-mail message and may allow access to certain cookies. Web Beacons are usually invisible to the user because they are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel). In general, however, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an Advertisement or Content, can act as a Web Beacon.\n\nb. Web Beacons on the website typically collect the URL of the page from which the Web Beacon originates, the type of browser requesting the Web Beacon, the IP address of the computer or device ID of the device to which the Web Beacon is sent and the time that the Web Beacon was viewed.\n\nc. Certain Web Beacons used by third party advertisers, content providers or other service providers may collect information that allows such third parties to determine how many people are viewing and/or clicking on certain Advertisements or viewing certain Content, Promotions or Services for purposes of helping these parties serve and manage their Advertisements, Content, Promotions and Services. These Web Beacons do not collect or store Personal Information but they may, however, be used in conjunction with cookies to identify certain aggregate information about users.\n\nDO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES\n\na. Vertigo or its third parties may also use tracking technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across third-party websites or other online services. The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is a cooperative group of ad serving providers. The NAI has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere. The NAI is committed to providing consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet generally. For more information about the NAI, third party ad servers generally and the opt-out options offered through the NAI, visithttp://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp.\n\nSimilarly, for residents of the European Union, Your Online Choices athttp://www.youronlinechoices.euis written and funded by the internet advertising industry and supports a pan-European industry initiative to enhance transparency and control for online behavioral advertising. Please visit the website and select the country option for which you are a resident to find out more information about your opt-out options.\n\nb. California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how Vertigo responds to Do Not Track browser settings. Vertigo does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. Vertigo continues to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.\n\n5. HOW VERTIGO USES INFORMATION\n\nWhen you provide Vertigo with your Personal Information, Vertigo may use it to manage Vertigos registry of Members, facilitate communication between Vertigo and you and/or between Members of a Service, notify you of features or special events and provide you with other information Vertigo feels may be of interest to you. Vertigo also uses information collected to customize, analyze, adjust and improve our Services, Content, and Promotions and to meet Vertigos users needs and expectations. Vertigo also may use the information to oversee adherence to Vertigos guidelines for user content which are provided in the terms of use for the Services to enforce Vertigos agreements with you, to prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities and for other legally permissible purposes.

These profiles, or a portion thereof, may be viewed by other Users of a Service, including, but not limited to those who are not Members of such Service.\n\nE-Newsletters.If you register at a Service or subscribe to any features or services, you may choose to receive a newsletter via e-mail from Vertigo or other notifications via a mobile application which may include information such as highlights from different areas on a Service, and information about new features, Content, Promotions or other Services. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on the manage your preferences link at the bottom of any e-mail newsletter sent to you and following the instructions. You also may unsubscribe at any time by logging in to the applicable Service where you created your profile and changing your preferences. Furthermore, you may elect to turn off notifications in a mobile application.\n\nPromotions.Often times, Promotions offered on a Service are sponsored by unaffiliated third parties. Information that you provide as part of an entry into a Promotion sponsored by an unaffiliated third party will be shared with the sponsor if Vertigo advises you of such in the Promotions official rules. Some Promotions also may require consent to the release of information contained within the entry form for background check purposes or tax purposes if you become a winner. You should carefully review the official rules of each Promotion that you enter as they may contain additional important information about Vertigos or the sponsors use of your Personal Information.\n\nFeatures and Services.Vertigo may retain other third parties and individuals to provide features and Services consistent with Vertigos Privacy Policy on Vertigos behalf. Examples include customer support specialists, web hosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and e-mail service providers.\n\nEditorial.Vertigo also may use your Personal Information in response to a solicitation for editorial, online or for marketing and promotional purposes in connection with such solicitation. If such information is used online, on a mobile application or in a telecast, no Personal Information, other than name, city and state, will be disclosed without your consent.\n\nSocial Network Features. Vertigo and the Content, Promotions and Services, may include features that connect to social networks and allow you to share or like Content, Promotions or Services with your friends or other users of the social networks. These social networks may collect information, such as your IP address, which page you are visiting on a Service, the videos you viewed, or the Content, Promotions or Services that you shared, and may set a cookie to enable the features to function properly. The social network providing the features on a Service may be able to collect information about you, even if you dont use those features. To control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network.\n\nEcommerce and Subscriptions.Vertigo may also use cookies to enable you to use a shopping cart if you want to enroll in a subscription or purchase goods or services while on a Service, to store your preferences associated with purchased goods or services or other Content offered from a Service and to offer you products, programs, or Promotions based on purchases, subscriptions and Service usage behavior that you and/or other customers have exhibited. If you purchase a subscription or goods and services through a Service, your Personal Information and payment information (other than credit card or debit card information) will be collected and stored by us with your account.\n\nVideos.

This aggregated information is used to, among other things, determine trends and needs and supply market research to potential advertisers and partners to help them understand our Services audiences. For example, Vertigo may create a report that tells advertisers that thirty percent of Vertigos Members are females under forty years, so that they can determine which of their Content, Promotions or Services are most appropriate for Vertigos Members.\n\nAdministration.From time to time, in Vertigo s sole discretion, Vertigo may use your Personal Information to send you important administrative information regarding the Services or changes to Vertigos terms and policies.

If you tell Vertigo that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, Vertigo will respect your wishes. You also may choose not to provide Vertigo with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of a Service. You may instruct Vertigo to stop sending you certain promotional materials (e.g., e-mail messages, newsletters, postcards and letters) by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in those materials or by turning of the notification feature on a mobile application.

Please note that if you use more than one name or e-mail address when communicating with Vertigo or participating on a Service, you may continue to receive communications from Vertigo to any name and/or e-mail address which you have not specified in your opt-out request.\n\nCorrecting or Removing Your Personal Information.For Personal Information Vertigo holds, you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or remove the data if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. For example, under the Data Protection Directive (European Union Directive 95/46/EC of October 24, 1995) you are entitled to obtain information (a) confirmation as to whether data relating to you is being processed and information as to the purposes of the processing, the categories of data, and the recipients to whom the data are disclosed; (b) communication of the data undergoing processing and of any available information as to their source; and (c) knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing of data concerning you.\n\nVertigo may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Under the Data\n\nProtection Directive, we may charge you a 5 fee to comply with your request.\n\nVertigo provides you with the following options for correcting or removing your Personal Information from Vertigos database for marketing purposes:\n\nYou can send an e-mail tolegal@vertigo-games.com; or you can send mail to the following postal address:\n\nVertigo Games B.V.\n\nWeena 723, 3013 AM Rotterdam\nNetherlands:\nAttention: Legal  Privacy\n\nCanceling Your Account or Subscription.To cancel your account or subscription, you can: (a) e-mailcustomer@vertigo-games.com, subject Cancel My Account or Cancel My Subscription and include the e-mail address that you registered your account or subscription with (if different from the e-mail address youre sending the e-mail from); or (b) via your online Member account page.

Vertigo may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.\nData Retention. Vertigo will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law or unless otherwise limited by law.\n\n9. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION\n\nThird Party Links.The Services may contain links to third-party web sites. Please be aware that Vertigo cannot control and is not responsible for the information collection practices of such web sites, which may differ from those of Vertigo. Vertigo encourages you to review and understand the privacy policies of these websites before providing any information to them.\n\nData Security.Vertigo (either itself or through third party service providers) maintains a variety of commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, Vertigo uses accepted tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to Vertigos systems. You should be aware that Vertigo has no control over the security of other sites on the Internet that you might visit or with which you might interact even when a link may appear to another site from one of the Services. Vertigo wants you to feel confident using the Services but no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although Vertigo takes steps to secure your information, Vertigo does not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your information, including your Personal Information, Vertigo will notify you as necessary and if possible so you can take appropriate protective steps. Vertigo may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) that Vertigo has on record for you and/or by regular mail (if available). You also should carefully handle and disclose your Personal Information.\n\nChildren.The Services are intended for general audiences and are not intended for children under thirteen (13) years of age. Vertigo requires that only persons thirteen (13) years of age or older use any of the Services. By using any Service, you hereby represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years old. Vertigo does not knowingly market to, solicit information, accept service or collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13). A Service may ask users for their birth dates to ensure that such Service is not collecting information from children under age thirteen (13) or to identify when additional steps may need to be taken in connection with information collected from children under age thirteen (13). When a Service has actual knowledge that it collects information from children or offers a service directed toward children, it will comply with applicable laws, including the U.S. Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. In the event that Vertigo learns that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age thirteen (13) without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Information from or about a child under thirteen (13), please contact us at:legal@vertigo-games.com.\n\nCertain Minors in the Netherlands.If you are a resident of the Netherlands, and you are a minor under the age of sixteen (16), then the consent of your legal representative is required for this Privacy Policy. Therefore, if you are under the age of sixteen (16), you represent to Vertigo that by using any of the Services, your legal representative has agreed (on your behalf and on behalf of such representative) to be bound by the terms of use for our Services and also consents to this Privacy Policy. If Vertigo learns that we have collected Personal Information from a minor under age sixteen (16), who is also a resident of the Netherlands and your legal representative has not provided consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you are a legal representative of a minor under the age of sixteen (16), who is a resident of the Netherlands, and believe that we might have any Personal Information from or about such minor, please contact us at:legal@vertigo-games.com.\n\nChanges to this Privacy Policy.At any time without prior notice, Vertigo may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Vertigos practices. When Vertigo posts changes to this Privacy Policy, Vertigo will revise the Last Updated date at the top of this page. Vertigo encourages you to bookmark this Privacy Policy and to periodically review it to inform yourself of changes to it or any of Vertigos other policies. Any changes to Vertigos Privacy Policy will become effective upon Vertigos posting of the updated policy.\n\nUse of any Service that inks to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy then in effect.\n\nCalifornia Privacy Rights.If you are a resident of the State of California, United States (California Users), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may have certain additional rights. You generally have the right to request information from Vertigo regarding the manner in which Vertigo shares certain categories of Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your Personal Information by us to third parties for the third parties direct marketing purposes. Under the law, however, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customers personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.\n\nPlease note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third partys privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as Vertigo has no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how it will handle your information.\n\nPlease note that Vertigo is only required to respond to one request per customer each year. Vertigo is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address:legal@vertigo-games.com.\n\nCalifornia residents who are minors under eighteen (18) years old may request the removal of any information that they posted to a Vertigo Service by contactinglegal@vertigo-games.com.

While I found that game frustrating and glitchy, I found AS smooth and silky. Gun play is fun, reloading is fun, killing Fred is fun, level design is fantastic and best of all, no stupid jumping! Pretty simple really, when I play Zombie games I want to be Ash, not Mario.\n\nSo refreshing to be outside and not the stock, underground facility with stock corridors.\n\nTerrific game, one of the best on Quest. What are you waiting for? Save humanity and eat burgers!\n\nHelpful | 72", "Rhydon21 days ago\nTop notch shooting + Zombies\n\nTLDR: Great game but not worth the full asking price at this point.\nPros:\n+Story was basic but the main character's narration made it enjoyable.\n+Shooting mechanics is on par with the best like gunclubVR. Very satisfying to aim down site for long range head pop.\n+Like the variety in guns and environments.\nCons:\n-Price. Perhaps when it first came out, the premium price was probably justified. But coupled with the short story, the DLC thats not included, cheaper/on-par competition that exists, I regret not waiting for a sale.\n-Moving mechanics are janky. Lack of free roam, unnecessary steps needed to back of spots show the age of the game.\n-Graphics could be better, perhaps a refresh?\n\nHelpful | 20", "quaireJul 28 at 9:20 PM\nAmazing game\n\nIm 47 years old, I never enjoyed shooting games, I didnt think they worth my time.\nArizona Sunshine, is not a game, its a masterpiece.\nThe graphics are beautiful, very well designed, the game is easy to play. The zombies can be quite scary at times, but funny as well.\nIts not hard to figure out whats your next step, you dont get stuck on a level, not knowing what to do.\nThe story is great, the language used maybe not suitable for younger players\nI played every day until I finished the game, wasnt that easy but wasnt that hard either.\nYou get plenty of different weapons and enough amo to shoot and blow things up.\nGreat game, definitely 5 star!!!\n\nHelpful | 26", "futureorcatrainer7118 days ago\nAwesome game worth buying!!\n\nIm not a bot for the record Im a real person!! This game is a lot of fun and the weapons that show up in the game are pretty cool & awesome like right now where I am I have a shotgun a revolver a grenade launcher and an uzi & there are different mask you can wear & change. Flawless, no glitches, no lagging, doesnt make your head hurt like some VR games do from moving so fast or something. I highly recommend buying it u wont regret it :)\n\nHelpful | 5", "OilyPotatoMay 22 at 4:14 AM\nGreat game but...\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing Ive had the quest since Christmas and have played this game most of the days Ive had it I havent tried the new dlcs yet but Im really happy with the low price the storyline is intriguing and the narration is comedic however there is one thing that let me down with this game. The first time I played I tried to use various melee weapons but it wouldnt work so what Im saying is ADD MELEE WEAPONS. If this doesnt happen, walking dead will come to the quest and this will be thrown out. The developers need to add this feature and also try and maybe add better graphic textures but hey Im just a 13 year old kid who like shooting brains out. If you have read this just take in the fact that there is now melee weapons however this is still a must have game for anyone who owns the quest even if you dont get melee or manual reload it is still a great game. Thanks for reading \n\nHelpful | 590", "illuminaut45Jul 16 at 12:51 PM\nAdd melee weapons\n\nI think this game had amazing gameplay and I really liked the how immersed I was but I think this game deserved a 4-star review because there wasn't that much gameplay and I wish there were DLCs to make it better but melee weapons would make the game more immersive and fun, also add real gun physics. (instead of having to put your gun by your belt, you have to grab a mag and put it in you gun and prime it.)\n\nHelpful | 8", "PaleoFossil254 hours ago\nBest zombie game for the Oculus Quest\n\nFinding good games for the Oculus Quest is hard scince it's a stand alone system so I went into this game with very low expectations. Lemme tell you you will get addicted to this game. It's immersive, scary, and leaves you feeling like a bada$$ after ripping through a horde of Freddies with a machine pistol in one hand and an Uzi in another. Only issue is the connection for multiplayer matches isn't great.\n\nHelpful | 0", "CorkCylinder73722 days ago\nAwsome game but with a few bugs\n\nThis game is so fun that I can play it again and again. The horde mode is really fun. Its like call of duty zombies but in VR. One thing that should be added is melee weapons if someone gets cornered by a horde of zombies. This is a must have for zombie fans.\n\nEDIT: the gameplay is ok but at certain points in the campaign that can sometimes not let the player continue. Its an annoying bug that the player has to go to the main menu and press continue to progress.\n\nHelpful | 7", "GimmieSumWings4 days ago\nWhat a Fun Time\n\nThis game is a hoot! Comical, yet dark tones mixed in with fun sharpshooting made for an enjoyable few days of gameplay. Started out a bit slowly, but once the ball gets rolling, its all very entrancing. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to follow a storyline as well as get some graphic zombie kills in!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Viviboi14 days ago\nAmazing game\n\nAt first I was a bit spectacle about purchasing this game as I had watched the pc gameplay and the graphics were not as good as I thought it would be on the quest,but when I played it for the first time it was so fun and the graphics didnt even matter as it was amusing to shoot zombies with your friends especially in horde mode\n\nHelpful | 2", "Captain-Diabetes21 days ago\nExcellent, even worth 40$\n\nPlaying with a friend is amazing, the story is good overall but its more shooting based (which is not a bad thing). Graphics are low, but thats not something that affects the gameplay which is absolutely amazing. Making your own stories with your friends and every little thing you do adds to the game in great ways. The 40$ looks like a lot, but I say its worth the money, especially if you have just 1 friend with the same game.\n\nOverall, one of the best games Ive played in quest.\n\nHelpful | 2", "mneresJul 2 at 9:45 AM\nAwesome game\n\nMy first zombie game and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOne thing that would be really helpful is a comprehensive tutorial on how to use guns, the difference between them, etc. if you dont know a lot about guns and ammo (like me) it really hard to decipher what does what (unless obviously its a machine gun)I purchased the two updates and finished them, looking forward for more!\n\nHelpful | 9", "Wellsfargo18 days ago\nCool Zombie Shooter Game\n\nI really enjoyed the game. The story is a bit thin, but fun!\nIn contrast to the German voice !! It is an absolute disaster !!!\nIf I hadn't been allowed to change the language to English, I would have given the game back.\nI would not have lasted 2 minutes.\nThe problem here is the same as with feature films.\nA really cool American film can turn into a real slapstick debacle in German dubbing.\nBut thats not the producers fault.\nI think it could be done better for 40 euros, but don't deduct a star.\nI gave the star deduction because of the lack of motivation to play the game again, because the levels of difficulty and the options for making changes are not interesting at first glance.\nTried the Apocalypse Mode, but here the difference is limited to finding almost no ammunition and the fact that the first time a zombie attacks you, you're dead instantly.\nI could support the latter, but the former is annoying.\nI'll keep trying to see if I can find an interesting setting after all.\nIf so, I add this rating and maybe give it the fifth star :-)\n\nBasically, I think the process of dying in the game is okay. You just start the chapter from the beginning.\nIt's the standard these days anyway. And the individual chapters are not that long.\n\nSo, I like the game!\nAlso like to play the other two zombie shooters Drop Dead and Death Horizon.\n\nHelpful | 2", "obi2kenobi4 days ago\nFun zombie shooter\n\nThe good:\n-terrific voice-acting narration\n-pretty decent graphics\n-variety of environments and guns\n-free movement\n-shooting zombies is great fun, and when a horde comes at you its definitely a rush!\n-it isn't level based where you complete disconnected and piecemeal scenes from a select menu. This is a legit campaign where you walk through the environment organically from start to finish.\n\nThe bad:\n-All the items/doors you have to interact with have big circles to identify them which breaks the immersion. This is an old game and it shows here, as people have found better ways to do this\n-the dark caves may be intense for some. I felt a little stressed, which can be fun but isn't for everyone\n-reloading of guns is arcadey, not sim style. I tend to prefer realism in VR\n\nOverall pretty minor nitpicks. The game is great and I haven't finished it yet or tried multiplayer or DLC!\n\nI know the price is high but it sure has a lot to offer and I've seen it on sale plenty too.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response4 days ago\n\nHi Obi2kenobi! If it helps, it's possible to turn off those indicators in the settings (It's something we added via a patch later down the road). Thanks for your feedback :)", "j_aem_138 days ago\nMost content in quest zombie genre\n\nThe bad: this has the textures and resolution that you should expect from a quest game. It also crashed occasionally for me. Some checkpoint placement is off and means deaths mean 20 or 30 minutes of catch up play. Two handed weapons are tricky to handle, lining up the front and back sights is very finicky. Grenades throw poorly. There's no melee.\n\nThe good: the shooting has absolutely been nailed here. Pistols are excellent and feel realistic, you have to really take care to aim. The atmosphere is fantastic - from sun bleached outdoors to flashlight illuminated mineshafts. You actually feel a sense of progression in the story like a traditional game. There's a variety too, between exploring with few enemies, to being rushed by waves and waves. There's co-op here too, though sadly it's not cross platform. There is far, far more content in this game than its competitors (other reviews compare this game and usually leave this fact out). To me it justifies the price. I'd go so far as to say if you like survival horror, zombies and guns, you'll like this game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "brandanstone9 days ago\nGreat game and good stories\n\nIts a great game with great stories but it needs more weapons like snipers and throwing knives and granades and more places to put guns on your body i hate it when i find two glocks or two m9s or two desert eagles and grab them and have no room for an smg or AR and for groups of zombies itd be nice to just throw a grenade and watch the zombie parts fly its needs more blood and gore and maybe slighty better graphics regarding zombies bodys and faces i personally believe that if we had more weapon option and equipment slots for guns and grenades and throwing knives and so on i think this game would blow up with a huge fan base maybe a sandbox mode should be made where you can test weapons spawn zombies to brutaly destroy in whatever way you choose and a sniper rifle with a scope should be added into the sandbox mode if you could duel wield any set of pistols you want or ar or smgs and have unlimited ammo or different types of ammo such as incindiary that sets the zombies ablaze or hollow points which kill zombies upon impact and last but not least fmj that penetrate multiple zombies bodies or heads at once. So to sum up what i suggest to make this game bigger would be alot more weapons a zombie sniper mode different types of ammo hollowpoint explosive etc. A sandbox mode where you can spawn zombies to kill or spawn groups at a time and pick any weapon or grenade or sniper or throwing knife to kill them whatever way you want and with the knife part itd be cool to be able to grab the zombies heads and stab it as seen on TWD saints and sinners\n\nHelpful | 0", "hanno229 days ago\nQuest Players will pay more\n\nArizona Sunshine is a very Good VR Zombie Shooter with okayish graphics and very pleasant gunplay. Its fun to shoot down zombies with a variety of weapons- but its very expensive compared to other versions like for the Rift or on Steam VR.\n\nThe campaign is about 3 intense hours of fun and some shocks and the damned-DLC adds another 2 hours on the playtime.\n\nI would recommend this Game especially on the quest but i dont like the priceing. Thats just Not fair. Price is More than 2x higher...\n\nHelpful | 0", "TabersmashOTJul 30 at 8:47 AM\nthe best Zombie game on the market\n\nThis game does everything right, from the weapons to the graphics to the movement of the zombies. The story is engaging and actually makes you care about the protagonist and the writing is very good. But what sets this game apart is the voice acting, which is incredible. I cant think of voice acting is any other game Ive played that was this good.\n\nHelpful | 2", "NightMonk3yMay 19 at 5:07 AM\nFantastic game, but no more updates.\n\nArizona sunshine is the best zombie experience on the quest by far. And may even be the best game on the quest so far. The price tag is justified i think 30 is a fair price for what you are getting. Environment graphics are really good, i think the zombies could improve abit more with a graphial update. I hope the devs look into this more, but seriously some awesome graphics. Watching gameplay through youtube isnt the same as the real experience. Ild say what needs work most is the reloading side of things. And also i dont like the fact the red dot assists me with the aiming as i like to aim down the site. But overall the game is absaloutley amazing.

It didnt really feel complete and I feel they couldve added more to the ending.

Ran my quest dry on first play. Cant say that about any other game. Didnt glitch once. Dont understand any negative reviews. Bought at discount but worth full price. Is it better than Death Horizon? Lets put that debate to rest. No, but its just as good, only different. I love shooters and especially zombie shooters. This is more like being in TWD and I like the bright outdoor settings. I think the graphics are great and mechanics are easy to get use to. The story is cool and so are the gun choices. DH has a darker only indoor setting and cool climbing with one handed shooting while hanging. The darker setting works well because you have laser sighted weapons. DH has bosses while I havent seen any yet in AZ. The fighting also seemed more intense with my heart rate going way up but that could have been due to the great sound track. AZ has horde and coop. I think DH has or is going to add that but may not have yet. You need to play/own both so it doesnt matter which one you get first.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Supersand2170516 days ago\nAmazingly good, but...\n\nIn terms of the campaign, Arizona Sunshine hits an apocalypse campaign in the sweet spot. The voice of the character is good, and his acting is phenomenal. The DLC is affordable but personally havent gotten around to buying it, but by the description it looks pretty good, I just want to know how many hours of gameplay the DLC will provide. But after you're done the campaign you're left with horde mode. This is where some of the problems ensue. It doesnt really give you time between waves to explore the new founded areas or collect the ammo or open the new doors and collect the guns in those said rooms. The horde just never stops so you cant get very far until you end up dying from trying to explore. This may just be a problem in single player mode however because I prefer to play alone. It would be nice to give a certain amount of zombies per wave like the good days of CoD. But since that is only one mode, it still gets a 5 star from me, especially because I got it 35% off. Highly recommended!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Soggy_Burrito14 days ago\nGreat zombie shooter\n\nSo when I got drop dead I was expecting a game where I can move around and stuff, but I couldnt.

My only disappointment is how short it is and in order to get a longer play through it costs some money for the DLCs.\nGraphics are decent but they look like giant walking blobs sometimes. Their faces dont render very well at Sunshine Road so I dont know if its a glitch or not.\nOne thing Id love to see implemented into the game is attachments for guns like laser sights or suppressors so when you shoot a zombie, the others wont horde around you.\nHorde Mode in multiplayer is glitchy at times and Im not sure if its a part of the game or not, but at one point at round 23, ammo and grenades just stopped generating.\nSometimes the game crashes on me at the start.

Many of the hordes that rush at you can be managed, if u can find the right place to stand.\n\nIt's easy enough that you don't have to be the ultimate gamer to progress in, but hard enough that u have to figure out the puzzles (some take some exploring) if u get stuck, plenty of walk throughs online to help.\n\nNo melee weapons, but don't let that stop u. Almost all of them go down with a single headshot. (Some require 2, since they are wearing helmets)\n\nTake ur time and explore. Take out as many zombies as u can.

The graphics are a bit blocky and the gun mechanics arent very fun, since you cant reload like you would with a real gun, instead you smack yourself in the ribcage. The combat gets repetitive quickly since you dont have any mechanics other than shooting zombies to kill them.

The downsides are no melee (cant even get close to zombies without taking damage) and they throw tons of guns at you, with no place to store more than 4, which kinda bites. Also, the Horde mode is so easy that I could play a single game until my Quest died and still never get close to losing, which is kinda weak, because you realize at some point that its not actually getting harder.

Graphics and mechanics definitely could be better with more time in development, but unfortunately I know that'll never happen as the mechanics have already been established in other iterations; so it plays just like the PSVR and PCVR versions. Digging a little deeper, the graphics do distract from being immersed in the universe, it's alot more fun playing online rather than by yourself in this version. I understand it's hard to bring a full fledged PCVR title to the quest so I thank the developers for trying their best in optimizing it as much as they could. I would assume the low poly zombies are due to the amount that come at you during intense moments, which is a large amount.

THAT was the entire Game the only cutscene is at the END OF THE GAME where you get saved by a Helicopter, that you called at the Radio Station and the entire GAME takes 5+ hours to play-through, thats stupid. The Game fells very cheaply made, the grafics, the characters and the Models, I mean if you played Multiplayer, then... did you f***ing see HOW THE CHARATERS MOVE?! That is so ridiculous!

I just finished the main campaign and am looking forward to playing through it again before going on to the dlc missions.\n\nI like the main character of the game, his humor adds life to the story. I love the great selection of weapons. Of course as others have said, I'd like to see melee weapons being introduced into the game. I'd also like to be able to run backwards. The graphics of this game aren't the best ,but this doesn't effect my rating due to the limitations of the quest, and more importantly, the game play is awesome!\n\nThis is my current favorite game on the Quest, and I'm looking forward to more games of this caliber!\n\nUpdate:\nJust finished the Deadman dlc. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, and wasn't nearly as satisfying as the main campaign ending. I like the new weapons, especially the shotgun!

I never was into shooters or zombies, but the gameplay and graphics (Oculus Quest) pulled me in. I recently became fascinated with Horde mode, in the canyon. my question is about the burgers. I know you can save burgers between the 5 wave \"break\" by holding on to them, and taking bites from them. But no matter what you do, the burgers will disappear. Sometimes all at once, sometimes one or two at a time. One time three burgers disappeared, only to reappear on the ground between the two crates! Developers - can you make it so the burgers don't disappear? It's discouraging to have an element of the game that is beyond our control, that if we are disciplined and able to save burgers for later on, we should be able to count on that effort later. The gameplay is good enough in Horde mode that you can get pulled in to where eventually conserving ammunition is an issue (above wave 50), and at that point, not having your burger stash just feels punishing and a little too random and poorly thought out, compared to the rest of the game. If this was intentional, I'd say poor choice. If it's a bug, *please* fix it!!!!!

I cannot stop playing this game in Horde mode but I also bought the most recent add-ons and played those too. The only thing I don't like so far is multiplayer and I have no personal friends with a Quest. I recently tried multiplayer with strangers and there were people on there just talking to each other [not engaging in the game] or trying to speak to me.

Keep Going Back!\n\nI dont leave many reviews but I feel obligated after reading others. The devs have done an incredible job building this from the ground up for Quest. I have purchased about 30 games on Quest so far and every time I log on, which is every day, Arizona Sunshine lures me back in. Its great fun blasting the heads off zombies! To everyone whining about not having melee options-its a shooter game! THEY CANT SIMPLY ADD MELEE  TO THE GAME! GET IVER IT AND ENJOY THE GAME! Sorry, but the deva seem to be working hard to update this game and im tired of everyone talking about options that arent going to happen! The horde mode keeps on giving and if you say its too easy youre probably lying or cheating! Those of you who hide in the crates so you can shoot and not be killed ruin the game for yourselves. Cheating isnt cool or clever. It just proves you dont have the skills to win without cheating!\n\nAS is a little pricey but you get your moneys worth. This is one of the few games I keep playing because I keep pushing to last a little longer in the Horde maps!

But for me it's less than 5 stars for the following reasons:\n\n1. Bizarre interaction mechanics. I'll be brief and give just one example: you can't drop a weapon. It sticks to your hand. When you want to use that hand to, say, turn a door handle, the weapon simply snaps out of existence and then reappears after. I can kind of see why the developers might have thought this was convenient. For me it was very counterintuitive and immersion-breaking.\n\n2. Invisible barriers. I understand that there have to be limits on where the player can go, and obstacles that must be overcome through puzzle-solving are a staple of great games. However, this game makes the conceit obvious to the point that it took me right out of the experience. You constantly encounter barriers that look for all the world like they could easily be walked around, over, under, or straight through, only to hear your character exclaim that they're utterly impassable until some key or whatever has been located. Barriers are fine, but they should look at least somewhat plausible as barriers. The situation isn't helped by the fact that some zombies *are* able to climb over barriers that our hero needs a key to get past.\n\nThat said, this is a relatively open, long, free-roaming experience with a real sense of journeying across great distances, through fairly varied environments. That's rare for Quest games and very rare for shooters. The story is compelling, the voice acting is solid and the set pieces are among the best I've experienced. You feel like you've been through something when you get to the end. The best compliment I can give is that upon finishing it I went right back and played it again from the start.\n\nUpdate: They added the ability to drop weapons. However, the implementation is - sorry to use this word again - bizarre. Rather than releasing the grip button to, you know, release an object from your grip, you have to hold A until a circle fills up. What's worse is that instructions pop up showing you how to this *repeatedly* during gameplay. And the way these instructions work is that your weapon is replaced by a model of the controller. Again, this happens *frequently* while you're playing. Talk about immersion-breaking. Still, at least you can drop weapons now. As a further update, I'm still replaying and loving this game. There is a fantastic core experience to be enjoyed here. Don't just give up on it. Keep going. It gets really good, despite the flaws!\n\nHelpful | 339", "J05HYRJun 25 at 9:51 AM\nMy favourite game\n\nIve had my quest for about a month.

A playstation version... his controller kept popping up. His version, he had/used assault rifles, grenade launchers, and his sniper rifles had the tubular scopes. Anyway... There's a switch on the right wall center inside. You must throw this, if not you die when you run out of ammo. Here's an added hint before you throw that lever to open the door: Open all the car doors, it slows down the hord. They get all caught up on the open doors... lol.\nIve learned some tricks to help me in this game against the hord of zombies that come at you. Thats positioning... position your character in an elevated place where the hord cant get to you. Then you can pick them off at your leisure. I dont play for quick time...\nTheres a glitch in the walking... while using the right controller to move it turns you slightly right, so your not facing straight as you walk.\nOh... and what was the designer thinking with that sight on the sniper rifles? Looks like the sights on the old WWII anti aircraft guns.

I would surely take the glock and uzi.\nRifles are two hand use... if you fire one handed its eratic.\nBarriors seem to stop you but not the attacker. Why not just give you a map and let you free roam everywhere.\nLimitations on ammo: 300 rds pistol, 100 rds shotgun, 1000 rds automatics, grenades 4.\nOnce you finish the game, why not let you have a choice to start again with your own choice of weapons load out.\nVehicle sizes: Tanks, Humvees, and vans are bigger then in real life.

Died in the missle silo twice... out of time! Finally made it out, fought my way to those base doors again... to be terminated because Im turning into something no longer human. Dead man is you because you dont actually live at the end. YOU DIE!\n06/19/20: Played the Dammed DLC game, had to pay about 7 dollars for the add on. Game starts blacked out... your in a car wreck where your the sole surviver. They give you what looks like a Taurus pistol &196 rds. (Again, not the way Id go in on a mission.) You have to kill zombies to get out of tunnel. Your at a dam, and have to work your way through to a control room at the bottom because this chic voice says so. She tells you to turn stuff on with the promise of rescue at the end. Guess what... she leaves you to drown with the hord of zombies. No pick up... you die!\nGuess vertigo games likes the no win senarios... I know I dont! To me dead end games are not worth the money.

Gives you melee weapons to pick up BUT No melee!? What!!? No manual reload.... enough said and have been said by other reviewers.\n(Stop making DLCs to make more money and listen to your community! A real fail.\n\n4. Moving around is really dull and frustrating, a small rock that you can easily step over... nope.. stops you in your tracks and teleport round it.\n\nI played it a few hours on a few occasions to give it a fair chance but this wasn't up to standards, no where near.\nFor those that love this game i envy you then i wouldn't feel like I wasted my money, its a forgotten app in my library.\nEither up your game to the standards of asking price or just drop price by half and DLCs are free...

Even when youre not playing with your friend theres a horde mode and you can still play the campaign. The only thing that I think they should fix with the game is the aiming. Its a little off in the game, you sometimes have to aim at the chest of the zombie to get a headshot. If you set it to easy mode you get a laser dot pointer and it helps tremendously. So the only thing that they should fix right now is the aiming. Other than that this game is AMAZING!!!!!! Oh forgot to add they need hand to hand combat and melee weapons. I really hope they work on this!!!!!\n\nHelpful | 1", "DudisPudisJun 17 at 8:22 PM\nMy favorite Zombie Shooter! But...\n\nThis is my favorite zombie shooter game in and out of VR but, it does have a few problems, but first Ill start with the pros.\n\nFirst the story mode, horde mode, and DLCs are AMAZING, great stories and gameplay, I love the mechanics and its very immersive, also the modes (except for Dead Man ) are long. Second, the graphics were actually wayyyy better than I was expecting and after you play for a while you dont notice it any more. And Finally, Third it has replay ability, after you beat all the modes you can just hop back in on a different difficulty, and you can do it multiplayer. Also a few days after I completed a mode I like to go back in and re do it.\n\nNow for the cons, First animations, whenever you play multiplayer with any body and see them walking it is so bad its hilarious! I cant even explain what it looks like and also even if your walking each time you climb a ladder or jump down theres no animation and it teleports you. Second, multiplayer mode (except for horde mode) sucks! You can only do the games (except for horde mode) with 1 other person, and if you play the multiplayer mode on the games the host is the only person that can do anything. For example if I was playing dead man with someone and they were the host I could not flip switches, pick up keys, or interact with anything except for ammo and guns. Finally, this is just a small one, but there are some glitches were it wont load me into the game, but I just reset my headset and it works, also if you pick up a mask/hat and wear it after like the 5th time you load the game it disappears.\n\nAnd thats my opinion for Arizona Sunshine, and just do you know I definitely would recommend this game to anyone.

When thinking about the price, you have to keep in mind the cheap DLCs, entertaining and engaging campaign, and endless fun in multiplayer modes. There are so many places that you see and so many things to interact with, and I think that this paired with the tough combat makes this game amazing.\nJust a few things that bugged me.\n\n1. Impassible barriers. Youre telling me that someone who has been alone in the apocalypse for god knows how long cant climb a five foot wall?!? Thats ridiculous, especially when the zombies can pass those barriers. Seriously, I am out of shape and I think that in real life I would be stronger than this guy.\n\n2. Reloading. Personally, I like the reload system in this game, but I still think that you should be able to switch from a one button reload to reloading manually if you desire. The reload takes away an aspect of the game seeming like reality. But, it is also helpful in some combat sequences.\n\n3. Why do you never interact with NPCs? You spend the entire game trying to get to civilization, and unless you are playing with a friend you never get to see anyone! This along with some other nit picky things (like people wearing a swimsuit or a motorcycle helmet inside of an army base) can bug people, but many people dont mind at all.\n\n4. NO MELEE WEAPONS!!! Ok, I know what youre thinking. What happens when you run out of ammo? That is what I thought too. But, not once during my hoard matches, campaign play through, or my play through of the DLCs did I ever run out of ammo. Not once. Still, the ability to take a hatchet and slice open the skull of a zombie would be greatly appreciated.\n\nOverall, I rate this game 5/5 stars despite its flaws. Out of every game I have played, this game is the most engaging, has the most value, and the best multiplayer content.

The story is compelling enough, though it is just thinly veiled excuses connecting set piece locations together, but the protagonist is entertaining to listen to and you're really here you enjoy the journey rather than blast zombies.\n\nCons:\nBad pacing - The game is slow, like really really slow most of the time, the majority of zombies you encounter are not a threat and come in ones and twos. You will spend most of your play time walking through corridors looking for macguffins to unlock doors. The action parts of the game swing the pendulum right the other way, usually at the climax of each area.\n\nJanky gunplay - I can see the devs where probably going for realism here, but aiming is pretty difficult. On top of the usual issues aiming guns in vr present, there's also an aiming cone the bullets trajectory is randomly fired down. This makes long range head shots pretty much impossible, forcing you to get really close. mind you, this doesn't actually make the zombies any more dangerous, just frustrating during the action sections.\n\nOverall:\nThe game has a lot of hype, and thus did not meet my expectations in any way.\n\nIt's competent, and enjoyable, but there are far better zombie shooters for far cheaper.\n\nI'd recommend if it where on sale, but it's definitely not worth the exorbitant price tag, and don't be fooled, this game is about the journey, not the action.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Xd_Jet42217 days ago\nGreat game\n\nGreat game it needs no comment\n\nHelpful | 0", "henrysaltJul 18 at 8:00 PM\nGood game\n\nI haven't played much but out of what I've played it's really fun.

First the background the developers could at least add a few for canyon walls or more props laying around.\n2. in multiplayer it can only be 2 people why cant it be a max of 4 or three i want to play with my other friends\n3. make it so we can melee the zombies( when im playng i would run out of ammo and they are hitting me i try to melee them but i die).\n4. add drinkable heals instead of just frozen meat.\n5. add more guns\n6. i know the game is really easy of easy mode and normal is too make a boss round or a type of story mode round where you have to fight a 30 foot beast and have to get to certain areas to find out its weakness\n7. add interacible props like the cans why would you add them if they dont have a purpose.\n8. add more collectibles like hats and even some type of hidden trophy or something\n9. make a longer story this story is too short ive beat the game 3 times in only 1 day even with other players\n10. make a bigger environement most of the time i forget and step inside a wall and i always gets me killed so just expand it a little.\n11. make it so the doors stay open instead of automaticly close\n12. make it so we can loot the bag props\n13. add more buildings and places to loot on multiplayer\n14. make it so we can grab props from other players but not guns and grenades\n15. make it so we can use the cans to distract zombies or use them as a weapon.\n16. make it so we can keep the duck or other props as we go to the next mission\n17. add a different varity of zombies not just walking or running zombies thats to plain\n18. the last thing that it needs is more jokes those are just dumb and funny most of the time and i think the chaacter doesnt talk enough\n\nthats all that i think that could make the game better\n\nHelpful | 84", "NicolasVargas02Jul 2 at 1:13 PM\nFantastic Game!!\n\nI had never had so much fun in horde mode playing with my friends but its a little to expensive but great game\n\nHelpful | 1", "MOARgolemJul 8 at 1:43 PM\nSo cool\n\nStory was so much fun.

It just didn't sit right with me. Anyway, out of the blue a wild sale appears! The game was reduced to 22.99. Ok, that seemed a bit more reasonable so I finally purchased the game.\n\nOver the course of the next few days I played the game solid and in two sessions I made my way through sunny Arizona to the end of the game. The experience lasted me around 5 hours in total because I like to explore everything in video games. The game itself is probably one of my favourite experiences on the Quest so far and one of the few that I have been driven to complete in back to back sessions. So what compelled me to finish the game?\n\nFirst of all I must say that the graphics are OK. Far from the quality of some other Quest titles, but they are enough to breath some life into the land of the undead, and although it's great to have sparkly, pretty graphics it is always worth remembering that the quest is essentially running on the hardware of last years mobile phones. So in my eyes the main thing I look for in a Quest game is how satisfying the gameplay is and this is where Arizona Sunshine, well.....shines...\nThe gunplay is very good and shooting the heads off zombies is extremely satisfying! You have to really line up those sights before you are rewarded with a gruesome POP! Depending on which part of the head you shoot also determines how the head explodes too. I mean, you can literally shoot a zombie's face off!\nThe exploration in AS is good too and although it's a linear experience the levels are big enough to provide a sense of exploration and immersion. However, the puzzles are really simple and never evolve much beyond find the key or the crank handle etc... although shooting zombies is what this game is truly about and it does this very well, with a multitude of weapons to choose from, ranging from pistols to grenade launchers.\n\nSo in conclusion is it worth the asking price? I would say yes and no. At 30 it's a tough decision although there is always horde mode to mess about with after the credits role and if you really fancy a challenge there is Apocalyptic mode which is said to be extremely hard to beat (I haven't got round to that yet). So if you like the main gameplay you could squeeze some extra zombie juice out of the title, and of course there is upcoming DLC which promises to extend the main campaign further.\n\nAll in all I had a blast and I don't regret my purchase at all, although I will deduct a point for the high price tag.\n\nHelpful | 296", "MemeShortageMay 24 at 8:52 AM\nLove it!\n\nI love this game, the narrator, the graphics, everything is beautiful.\n\nId love to see a melee weapon or at least a punch/break free button so I can escape when Im in a corner and out of ammo,\n\nHonestly, I dont have much of a problem with kids, as 90% of the time they are still decent teammates, my main issue is the constant screen tearing and crashes I get, the game is tons of fun, but I often have to restart or get booted after an hour or so on a multiplayer game.\n\nBut besides the bugs, the game is still awesome\n\nHelpful | 0", "Emmy1tenMay 27 at 3:57 PM\n\nGreat game so far, but it's a little glitchy. Zombies' hands go through walls, sometimes you get stuck in corners, and sometimes your weapon disappears if you are not perfectly aligned in your calibration area. However my biggest gripe is my inability to save where I left off during a campaign without having to start from the beginning of the level. It would be nice to be able to quit the game, and come back to a spot where a checkpoint was met. Unless I'm missing something.\nBut, overall teriffic job!

It took my roughly 4 days to complete the story alone, the entire time was a golden experience, the story is great, the gameplay is satisfying, and the mechanics and physics are fun. Being able to blow a zombie's head clean off with a shotgun, shooting their legs to make them crawl, throwing a grenade outside of a door where an entire horde is clawing their way in, and let's not forget, throwing a pan at them, all of it is fun.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is graphics, but it's not a big deal, to some, it might look like it's low quality with some detail. To me, it reminds me the graphics from Borderlands. And another thing, sometimes, when playing multiplayer, I couldn't connect to some servers, but I was able to create one and play from there. But again, it's not a big deal because in my view, the game is perfect and couldn't be made better.\n\nIn story mode, you go place to place, shooting the undead, scavenging for ammo and burger patties (for health) and your only guide is your moral compass. You play as a guy who makes snarky remarks and witty puns. His goal is to escape the zombies which he refers to as Fred. He always says the goal out loud. Locked door? \"Gotta find the key.\" No power? \"Should be a power switch nearby.\" A horde blocking the only path? \"Wow! I don't think I have enough firepower for that....\" I love the moral compass that you have.\n\nSummary: The game is fun, thrilling, even giving you multiple experiences to deal with zombies. Little to no problems, and if found can easily be fixed. Multiplayer is great way to tackle Horde Mode, and even make new Quest friends. The game keeps you on your toes and you can come up with creative, but also simple easy thinking.

Zombies caught me off guard a few times made me feel like i was in the game. Having to look for certain things like a hand crank was tedious also and havin to look for stuff made me a bit nautious. Really I wanted a shootem up game where you go through different areas just blowing there heads off. This game comes really close. Part that really bummed me out was I literally played it 3 days casually and it was over. I mean theres a dlc or 2 and little games you can play. The story mode was just so fast. I feel like I wasted my money buying it too soon when i probably could have bought it later on sale. It seems to be a trend with these games, I played the vader games and they were also way too fast.

Different difficulty levels from those who want to just have fun, to those who really want to treat it like a zombie apocalypse and ammo is VERY scarce. Horde mode gets fun. DLC is nice to have. Playing online with others a definite fun experience.\n\nTo the Devs: what I think it needs.\n- melee weapons: a bat, frying pan, spiked bat or something, a pipe, hammer, etc. These would be nice to find. Even let them break after a certain amount of uses so they wouldn't be TOTALLY overpowered.\n- special zombies: something to change up the mentality of just seeing another regular zombie; something that makes me have to think and change my gameplay would be nice.\n- grenade launcher ammo: if you're going to have the grenade launcher, at least spread out more ammo for it instead of JUST at the point when you get the gun or the last stand point of the last level. I was carrying this gun around hoping to find more ammo for it and was disappointed to know that there wasn't any when I could've switched with another weapon a long time ago.\n- zombies should be able to breakdown doors. The moment I close the door during a zombie horde (not horde mode), I feel COMPLETELY safe. In an apocalypse, that should never be the case. The feeling of being TEMPORARILY safe is what I prefer because of the very limited time of what you need to do before you need to fight.\n\nTo the reviewer:\nDEFINITELY expensive to get.

I bought it. I played it. And I'm seriously considering a refund.\n\nI am utterly bewildered about what game people are raving about, because, surely, it cannot be this one.\n\nThe downsides started at first boot. Crashed on loading screen. Rebooted the whole quest and got it going. Was treated to some sort of menu lobby in a container. What is interactive follows no logic. It's just random. And stuff sticks to my hands when I try to let go. No obvious way to work the menu until I found a dart gun that acted like a zapper. Got a campaign going. There's a gun in front of me, can I pick it up? No, can I move? No. Suddenly I trigger something and I can pick up the gun. And FINALLY I am in the game. Shambling. Frustrated at the teleport. Where I can and cannot move follows no logic.Guns are dumbed down in a strange way that makes me confused. Aiming is spot on at times but I can't be sure at others.\n\nSometimes the gun in my hands disappear. Sometimes I switch to another item when I want to reload...\n\nOk. Letting all those things slide. I still am not at all impressed with anything. Models feel ripped from early PS1 games. Sounds are merely servicable. The narration is grating at best.

The added DLC is very enjoyable as well and worth a few more hours of gameplay. One of the best features of this game is the multiplayer modes. You can team up with a friend and go through the campaign together which is a big plus and even play with a team of four in horde mode! As far as a Zombie Shooter goes and their are many.... This is one of, if not the best the Quest has to offer! Only reason I'm not throwing five stars is due to experiencing some occasional glitches.

Here's the good before we get into the roughness. Shooting the zombies is great fun. Some of the vistas and locations were highly immersive and beautiful to look at. It's quite the adventure, and there's so much to be said for mowing down a horde of zombies in the beautiful Arizona desert. You can sympathize with the main character as he searches for survivors, and the game makes you feel like you are the main character. That being said, let's get into why I'm giving it three stars. It's not the graphical quality, which I actually disregard most of the time when making reviews. I didn't mind the graphics at all, when they worked. On Quest, there's an extreme level of pop-in inside certain levels of the campaign. The abandoned mine for instance, was broken for me; I could see through the walls into blank whiteness as I walked through it. Almost none of the environment was showing up. It didn't just break the immersion, it almost broke the game. When I used the radio above the hillbilly park, the whole game glitched out, and I had to reboot and try again, then it worked. In the end I was still able to get through the game. When it was working smoothly, I had the time of my life. The Horde Mode Multiplayer has an issue with finding matches as far as I can tell. When someone did finally show up, it was an amazing experience. I hope multiplayer is more populated than I think it is, because it's so much fun! In conclusion, this is a really early VR game, and has earned it's place among the classics, but there needs to be some remastering. I don't regret my purchase, I enjoyed it.

Thanks for your feedback and thank you for playing! Melee weapons were something we never felt could get right or satisfying enough, even in the PCVR version, so we made the decision to leave it out and focus on making the gunplay and level design shine. It is also something we can't simply add to the game anymore without sacrificing some of the optimizing we've had to do for the Quest version. We hope you understand this.

You would think it would be downloaded as the updated version considering its still a 22+ game, but the DLC is pretty cheap so it's not really a big deal.\nMultiplayer is super fun especially when you have a good team on the go.

But the length? Thank Christ for the dlc or this game would've felt like i went all in on a pair of threes. Jesus. I decided on this instead of death horizon solely for head shots, i figured 40? I bet you I'll be exploring a multiplayer world with devs. Psh,maybe on DH i would've. Devs are great over there,updates every other week or so. I don't want to complain i just expected an open worlds multiplayer. This game really is the tops thanks to the dlc saving the length. My one and only remorse left is how much i really thought i was going to be running around the whole of Arizona with other survivors. More resident evil in a desert.\nOh and any game with climbing is so much better for such a simple mechanism.\nHave i mentioned all the sales i missed on games i want cause my card gotfrozen when covid closed my bankand i had to order a new one? Not my month. Time to go play n change that.\n\nSo. Sorry i rambled. But get it. With our without the dlc and you will NOT be disappointed, but each dlc doubles game length for 2 freaking bucks.\nBut if you're really neck and neck with this and DH? You're going to want both.

This game is very fun, but it is a little klunky with how you pick up stuff. Also with eating. I feel like these should be a little enhanced. As they are one of the most important things in the game. Other than that it is really good.\n\nEDIT: so, I made this review awhile ago, that was when I only beat the game on regular mode and havent tried anything else. It was just dry. I literally just beat apocalyptic mode solo in one sitting. Had a lot more fun, it was actually difficult and all I could use was a desert eagle. I noticed how some of the dialogue for when you find a good weapon, like the grenade launcher for example, in apocalyptic, wasnt removed. In apocalyptic you can only use one gun, the one you start with. So it looks and sounds like he is going crazy and imagining these cool weapons. Also, I feel like we should be rewarded for finishing, more than just an achievement. Also, once again, I would still like better interactions with objects. Maybe try and upgrade the graphics as well, I know the quest cant take\nMuch, but Ive definitely seen games larger with better graphics. Also, another graphical issue for me is how you walk in multiplayer. Please, can we actually be normal. Also zombies hitting you through walls. If you are close to a wall and a zombie is on the other side. You are likely to get hit. Thats all. Hope this helped.\n( TD = the newest DLCs you cant write it because it counts as a profound word)\nNow to both of the DLCs. The first one (Deadman) was really good. Almost as good as the base game. I loved how it could relate to the story a little more. Also the new guns. Now to TD DLC. It is the biggest waste of your money. It is only 5 dollars. I understand that. But the other one was great and was priced a little bit less. This DLC had the dumbest ending along with it being just the same thing and it can easily be beaten in under 30 minutes. Id rather buy the deadman DLC again rather than this. Anybody who wants to buy it. I just suggest looking up the DLC and watching a walkthrough of it or something. 4 stars because the base game and the first DLC are great.

Quite scary at times. I hate going inside the dark mine part!\n\nHowever, Im finding the controls a bit fiddly especially recharging ammo is not so easy nor intuitive. Zombies would be attacking me before I manage to recharge my guns. Would be good to be able to run rather than the slow pace walking. Also would be nice to be able to use melee weapons to smash zombies heads with. Hope updates in the future.\n\nMy main problem is when I tried to join a multiplayer mode, it keeps coming back saying cannot connect to server or something.

Buuuuut there's a few things that make me regret my purchase.\nFirstly, the game it's self isn't that long. I played along with my friend through the campaign missions, we had a great time and it was enjoyable. But that was it, I haven't played it since the release until today because of the new dlc.\nSecondly, the ending to the game I feel wasn't as much as I antisipated for as I feel there was alot of hype just for a small fight. I feel as if there should've been more to it.\nThirdly, the new dlc isn't what I hoped for as the game is a one time thing. Once you've completed the campaign there's no point to try on a harder difficulty as there's no new enimies that are harder to defeat and no new weapons to use. So I was extatic when I heard that there was new content to play. The new dlc was quite fun to complete and I loved using the new weapons although there wasn't alot to the mission. It was pretty basic. Find the nuke, detonate it and excape. The ending to this dlc was terrible and I don't see how this can be carried on. In my opinion the new dlc has no links or ties to the original campaign and it feels not like the original. This makes me think that that's the end of a 30 POUND GAME!\nHowever, arizona is a good game for one time use. And the dlc was only 2.49\n\nHelpful | 3", "KRAW2DEATH01Jun 6 at 3:13 PM\nThis game is really good\n\nI love the game but I think the could be longer\n\nHelpful | 1", "MaelwolfApr 19 at 11:24 PM\nQuite the Adventure\n\nIve now played the 3 zombie games available on Quest, and I think this might be my favourite.

I had to play this all the way to the end in one sitting, then went straight into multiplayer.\n\nA great game overall and pretty close to the PC version.

The inventory and holster system felt a bit strange compared to other games Ive played. This isnt really a bad thing because it was easy to use but it felt a bit over simplified. Early in the game you are introduced to the idea that you have to loot to get things like guns and ammo. The biggest opportunity for that was usually cars which always seemed empty. Adding functioning melee items like knives and bats could make the combat more fun, and could also improve the looting experience. The game has some AWESOME experiences however. Some points in the story were scary and stressful, forcing you outside of your comfort zone, this made completing those tasks much more rewarding. The occasional zombie horde coming at you was sometimes awesome but at other times absolutely horrifying. The character monologue was hysterical, but I had some mixed feeling about it. In most Vr games I want to feel like I am the one in their, but the monologue sometimes took that immersion out. The walking mechanics felt pretty smooth and really made the game enjoyable. Overall the game was great, I feel it was a bit overpriced but were the story longer I could see it being worth the price tag.\n\nHelpful | 1", "DeepMellowJun 2 at 6:30 AM\nWorst graphics of all time.\n\nThis is 2020 and this game looks like a Nintendo 64 game.

At first I was deterred because the attitude of the devs has just been largely received negatively by the community and the game is definitely overpriced on Quest.\n\nThe graphics downgrade is noticeable but through the lens it never looks as bad as it will on a video. For me it wasn't game breaking and I've still enjoyed what I've played through.\n\nThe game is older so the VR mechanics are outdated and the game lacks a lot of things that newer VR titles have as standard for interactions, physics, melee, environments etc.\n\nThe base game being old is the biggest reason not to buy it at this price, you can probably finish the game before your Quest runs out of charge and the price is simply stupid for the content offered. Lies Beneath could be considered a AAA quest title and it costs less.\n\nThe devs dont support cross buy or cross play and have been pretty apathetic towards consumers who questioned this decision (especially for cross buy). It could very reasonably be argued that they would have made more money by seeming more open to these ideas. I had the game on steam, and even at $50 it would have been an instant purchase for me if it had cross buy enabled.\n\nIn summary the game is good but wait until it's on sale, it's worth maybe 60% of the current price.\n\nHelpful | 9", "Keyser_Soze._Mar 13 at 6:44 PM\nFun, but glitchy...\n\nI know this game has its roots in the rift, so I realize it probably performs better on that platform, so Ill take that into consideration here. But it would be great to see this game continue to evolve (like the recent addition of the undead canyon). When I say glitchy, I am referring to Zs that just climb through a wall when it was obvious that they were supposed to climb through a window, and sound defects that never stop and can drive you crazy over the period of a campaign that can last an hour or more depending on how many waves you make it through. I think $20 is a good price point for this game, instead of its current $30 today.

The zombies aren't too scary and are actually pretty easy to deal with. There is even a DLC in which you can purchase for only $2.49!

Shooting zombies is very satisfying (although switching though guns is a bit of a hassle) and has a fun story mode with a very solid voice actor, the graphics really bump the experience down a bit. Especially when you look at the pc version. While I guess you could justify that the graphics look so ruff because the limitations of the quest (which it does have) there are open area games on the quest that look a million times better than these graphics. Games like Robo recall, death horizons, and red matter show that quest games can look good or at least half decent, but the zombies in this game do not look good at all and theyll clip though walls and rag doll all over the place. I understand that optimization is important for performance but jeez. I dont know if its the engine this game runs on causes poor optimization or otherwise, it really breaks the immersion of the game, which is important for vr.

(Usually VR games are 2 hours at most) there is also a second campaign, which is the same, but with slight differences. As well as a horde mode. However, the game doesnt have that much to justify the 4 hour length. You see pretty much see all of the enemies within the first 15 minutes as well as almost all the weapons 1 hour in. Like the developers wanted to make a longer then 2 hour VR game, but didnt add anything else to keep the player interesting. You can kind of see this in the game as the game uses the same plot twist twice. The gameplay is fairly solid if, as kind of stated, a little repetitive. Note: Do Not Expect DAYZ VR. This game is very simple. It very linear and health is easy to restore. You dont have to worry about food or water, but you dont really even need to worry about ammo as you get plenty. You do have to be a bit tactical with shotguns and machine guns since ammo for them is more rare then pistol ammo. But as long as you only use it when need, you shouldnt run out. Explosive ammo is only found in 2 spots in the whole game. However, shooting zombies is pretty fun. At 40$ use extreme caution.

It's so fun and addicting. The shooting and aiming down sights is pretty realistic. I only have two complaints, first is that it would be nice if the zombie sounds that you hear would actually come from the direction that the zombies are at, instead of just hearing the zombie moans all around you.

If only I had known about the refund policy before I spent an hour and a half trying to calibrate the holsters. It is far too expensive for the game that it is. If it was 5 or 10 dollars instead of 40, my review would be much more positive, but it feels so overwhelmingly unpolished that its almost a waste of your quests battery in the first place. The graphics make you feel like youve been thrown into a bad 3D mobile game. The campaign isnt short, so Ill give them that, but the puzzles and gameplay arent anything special, and the voice acting is atrocious. I initially wanted the game for the replay-ability of the horde mode. Wave after wave of killing zombies sounds fun, and it is for a while, but theres only so much you can do. Its just shooting zombies, eating a hamburger patty, reloading, and repeating. Almost everyone you will meet is about 10. The object physics are pretty broken- certain objects will float in place, and the object positions arent the same between online players, which really shatters the scarce amount of immersion that this game provides. I was also annoyed by the lack of animations for other players- they dont walk, they glide, and their legs slide around after them, like theyre glued to the ground. While its not game breaking, youd think a forty dollar game would do better. I think that this games only redeeming quality is that you can play the campaign with a friend. If you really want to play an online wave-based zombie shooting game, set up Sidequest, and download Pavlov Shack. Its free at the moment, and has a zombies mode which is better all around. If you were interested in the campaign, I recommend waiting for the quest release of TWD- Saints and Sinners, which looks to be much better in respects to story, atmosphere, physics, and (probably) price. I cant decide if you buy this game or not, but all I can ask is that you be smart with your money.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper ResponseMar 24 at 7:43 AM\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts. Our efforts went mainly into bringing the complete PCVR experience of Arizona Sunshine over to the mobile hardware. Aside from the obvious graphical downgrade, we've done spent a great deal of time to develop and optimize the game for Quest, and giving it a full campaign and horde modes like the PC version. All the titles you've mentioned are excellent, but also had the advantage of having been developed in recent years. We wanted to deliver on the requests of players familiar with the original game, who wanting the title they know and love on Quest, while also giving new Quest players a chance to experience the full game for the first time. Again, thanks for your feedback and playing, we do hope you gained a bit of insight on our end!", "galvinsean89May 9 at 1:49 PM\n\"The Dammed\" DLC screwed everything\n\nI purchased \"The Dammed\" add on and played through it once.

The campaign isn't insanely short now in the finished version (definitely a couple hours), but not very long either. $40 is a lot for how short and simple it is. The DLC for $2.49 adds a very short section, I'd say about 30-40 minutes of play time.\n\nUnfortunately the low resolution of the Quest makes some of the ironsights frustratingly hard to see.\n\nTip: guns within the same category don't differ in damage according to guides I found (i.e. all revolvers are the same, all pistols are the same, ...), so pick the one with the sights that work best for you.\n\nOtherwise, the controls are reasonably good.\n\nRan into issues at doors, once got my head stuck in the environment and couldn't get out, the \"medkits\" are confusing (just decoration), but overall OK.\n\nHelpful | 1", "HongkeySamApr 27 at 4:18 AM\nNice shooting Zombie Game\n\nNice story line but it is a bit too short.

I try horde mode and there is no fun just shooting, and on undead valley the key system is broken and you dont know what to do. Plus keys do not work at all and one leads to nothing. In addition walking al all causes the game to randomly turn you around leading to you getting killed. To add, walking near certain objects will cause you to have to move in real life in order to move again in game. Buggy mess. Making it even worse the graphics suck and the story is boring. The protagonist complains that he is thirsty but you cant drink the thousands of water bottles around the map, not can you use any one the other props. The collisions on them are terrible too, and you cant even put an item in the frying pan, it floats above it. Theres no pausing so if you have to go and miss a zombie in your area it will kill you and youll restart from the last checkpoint, or youll have to do that yourself. The story itself is basic and bland. You find all of these interesting leads only to be let down time and time again, just so the story could be more that two hours long so you cant get a refund. They ending isnt rewarding and theres nothing more. Not even an epilogue. The weapons suck too, as there is no variety. There are no two handed weapons you can find in the Champlain unless you play with ONLY two handed weapons. There are two rifles. One is semi automatic and terrible. The other is a sniper which is inaccurate and you cant take with you. One time you take a key and hold it, but the rest of the times its in your inventory, and when you grab something with an occupied hand the item disappears. Any time you do anything such as load into the main menu area, you get constant reminders on how to run, grab, shoot, insert keys, open doors, eject magazines, etc. The excuses for why you cant leave a certain area are dumb as well. I dont even have to notice a radio but my character (who according to dialogue when you actually see it didnt know it was there) says to check out the radio first. The zombies can climb over small barricades but we either cant or need a key which is the stupidest thing. Speaking of zombies how many shots did the design team take before designing them? They certainly match the hideous factor but not for the right reason. They are stupid cookie-cutter enemies which only can hurt you when you get cornered by an invisible barrier or when the game turns you around for an unknown reason. They all are the same and only a few provide any challenge but it is quickly turned into annoyance. There is a grenade launcher which you can get ammo for but have to find in a specific hidden area, and you dont know the blast radius of grenades so you wind up killing your self. And the grenades, oh the grenades. Your character throws them so wimpily that you have barely any time to get far enough away before they explode. Also itd be nice if youd add someone to practice with the guns. A shooting range or something for you can test them out. Also it would be nice if you didnt have to rely on iron sights, and there were some weapon attachments. Finally, a specific problem Ive had is that the winch for the gate that leads you to the mine should not activate a car alarm when picked up. Firstly it makes no sense how picking something up would do that, and secondly we already unarmed the car so why would it do that? Overall worth maybe 5-10 dollars, not $40. Especially because you had the audacity to charge for an expansion. I dont care how cheap, the most expensive game for the oculus quest should not be charging for an expansion, mostly due to this game bean a hot steaming pile of horse crap.

Crazy stuff haha You can't go back where you came from, you can't go ahead, you're stuck there.\nIf it wasn't for this, it would get 5 stars from me.\n\nEDIT: had to add an additional star because, besides a few bugs here and there, this game is great\n\nHelpful | 1", "ldubtdubjdubApr 27 at 9:43 AM\nLots of fun!\n\nThis game is pretty challenging and fun.

The shooting is realistic and so satisfying once you get the hang of it, this game can make you forget where you are when youre chilling and all of a sudden a massive hoard of zombies comes after you and you mow them down. Those are a few good things about the game, but heres a few great things. Lets start with the campaign. So far Ive yet to finish it though I think Im halfway through, and Im astounded by how immersive this campaign is. Your characters dialogue is comedic and though it can break your immersion it helps bring some light to the game. When I was trying to loot a car and all of a sudden 20 zombies jumped me I actually felt afraid and the more it happened I still felt afraid, and keeping me feeling consistently scared and happy is something a lot of zombie games fail at for me. The campaign is also fairly long for vr, Im only half way through and Ive sunken about 4 hours into it already. Overall the campaign has been really fun and immersive and I dont even usually like zombie or horror games. Sadly Ive yet to try the hoard mode but judging by how it feels when a hoard attacks you in the regular campaign I assume its great. The only 2 complaints I have is that there should be a few different zombie types (I know there are other types I just wish there was more) and there should be melee weapons. Overall its an amazing game thats more than worth the price of forty dollars\n\nHelpful | 0", "virtual_player_oneApr 17 at 7:00 PM\nNeeds punch\n\nLiterally, I need to punch or something when out of bullets.

But where is interaction? I know the quest is kinda wonky. Its not the best headset in gaming history but it is decent. I would really like to see something like: Hitting a can over with my hand, melee weapons, climbing rocks, and actual reloading. I know these things are little but seeing then would be fantastic.

They should just act like other objects but return to their original location if dropped\n\nWhen holding the gun at the beginning of the game, every time you shoot your hands grip tighter around the gun. Its kind of weird of an animation and doesnt happen with any other gun\n\nYour hands fall off when you die, which is kind of weird\n\nThe aiming is set to the left eye. So if you close your right eye and line up the sights, you hit all your shots. There should be an opinion to switch the aiming to the right eye. Im right eye dominant so this would be more natural to me\n\nYour waist is wonky because your holstered gun is inside you. It should be more offset on whichever side its on from right below the headset. It would probably also be better if the calibration put your waists a little higher than what it does.\n\nThe text should be bigger for you died and things like that. Putting them in the 8bit font thats used in the beginning menu would be a nice touch\n\nThere should definitely be a bigger indication in horde mode that there are more guns and ammo on the crates. The text font like mentioned above would be a nice touch too.\n\nIn horde mode, there isnt enough ammo. I was playing with 3 other people and we died because we all ran out of ammo. Maybe this is because we didnt use it wisely, but I felt like I did.\n\nReloading by shoving your hand into your chest is weird. It doesnt feel natural. Maybe putting your hand to your waist would be a more natural reload.\n\nPlease consider making melee items a thing, or at least being able to stun zombies by throwing cans, bottles and other items at them.\n\nThese are all relatively minor, but if these things were addressed, the game would be a bit nicer.

Your hands don't even touch the door knobs, so you have to open doors at a distance, render the hands useless. Not a very good VR experience. The preview makes it look amazing but the graphic sucks. If you want real zombies action play, try Death Horizon: Reloaded. Everything is better, however it's too short. The graphics reminds me of of N64 James Bond Golden Eye game.

But then again, all my favorite video games are from that time. The graphic is not so bad that pulls me out of the game, enough to sell the story. Game play is snappy and fun. There is also the horde mode after the campaign, adds tons playability. Game Dev seems still making new contents for the game too.

Which is really what I love so much about this game. Surviving waves of zombies with random people and racking up hundreds of zombie kills on the board together is just dope. However it was the second game I bought on the quest and getting used to the movement took me a week before I finally felt comfortable running hours of waves of zombies.

Calling it \"okay\" is still a stretch. I don't know if I'm missing something, or if it's an internet meme, or whatever, but the game play, the textures, the mechanics, the speed, all of it, sucks. I wouldn't normally be so harsh in a review, but I paid 40 dollars for a game that I feel could easily have been 10 or 15. 20 would even be pushing it. I continue to play the game just in case some NPC pops out at some point and says, \"Hey, you thought this was the game? Guess again!\" and the real game shows up. I'd give details, but I'd be here all day. So I'll just leave perspective: Your game has a problem when the zombies are programmed to collapse dramatically to the floor because you shot them once in the arm, but shoot another zombie in the arm wearing a motorcycle helmet, then it's like they automatically have an 85 percent increased armor boost shielding them from being shot, anywhere on their body.  Let alone being shot in the head with no helmet, and they still chase you.

The games textures and color palette hurts my eyes. The game has a really orange color contrast that give me a little bit of a headache and the textures on the plants could be a little bit better. Also there should be more plants and junk around the map. But it's the color that i have a bigger problem with. It should be a bit more of a cool tone rather than all orange.\n\n2. The zombies should have better textures than they do. They should have more detail to them. It would also be cool if they had more realistic blood/gore.\n\n3. It would be nice if you had the option to change the time of day on the outdoor maps in hoard mode.\n\nThat being said, this is a great game to have on the quest, and i think it would be a little more of an enjoyable experience with these suggestions implemented.\n\nHelpful | 1", "VelutinaMar 29 at 12:16 AM\nNot bad at all\n\nI've enjoyed Arizona Sunshine lots of times and the horde mode is cool to play with friends. The game itself deserves a five stars, this update I think it's a three\n\nThis paying update is not necessary, it's the same and doesn't look well. When moving my head, graphics gone bad (I don't know if you made it on purpouse but don't think it's necessary for the history) but it's not nice and doesn't make sense, as I see.\n\nBesides of the graphics issue, I'm sick of viewing always the same six or eight zombies everywhere, it's kind of boring. The bikini girl, the soldier, the suit man... Maybe some new faces anytime?\n\nIt would be great if you add two things: an open world scenario and the possibility to use pots, knives, chairs or whatever we found during the game as weapon.\n\nI'm not sure If I recommend to buy this update, the gameplay is less than an hour and the hard mode is very easy and predectible; one can think \"well, now a little horde and we keep on going\".

Graphics surely aren't the best but actually I didn't even bother to notice it anymore after playing for a bit. It's what you get in this game.\nThe mechanics..... Euhm, not the best for me. I don't like the way the guns are somewhere down below your knees, the belt with the armory is also not wel placed (like it's in my body and not around my body) so it's not always the best to get your firearms recharged. A'd guns stuck to your hands.... Why? (I get it on one way, so you get to carry more guns around)\nOpening doors, lockers, drawers.... Meh, just not good enough, very clumsy interaction.\nFor me the storyline is ok, sometimes frustrating when you die and have to repeat the whole scene again, and again, and again... But maybe that's my clumsiness in shooting.\nDefinitely not my favorite game I bought on the oculus but I gave it a try when it was on sale but it definitely isn't worth the 40 in original price.\n\nHelpful | 1", "J4KJ4YApr 13 at 9:23 AM\n\nGreat game and physics.

Its a fantastic concept and the environment alone is super intriguing. I just found that it wasnt for me. I am a big fan of Death Horizon and find the controls and movement far superior than AZ Sunshine. In AZ, locomotion feels a little clunky and controls are a bit awkward (for instance, after an hour and a half I cant even figure out how to drop weaponsif its even possibleit always makes me keep something in my hands). I have also been unable to manually climb ladders. Instead, it just takes me straight to the top. This was a huge letdown for me as it takes away from the immersion. If gameplay and controls were as smooth as Death Horizon, or even Espire 1 which Ive been playing a lot of, I would be stoked. However, I will likely wait for co-op and horde mode to come to Death Horizon, which I hear are both in the works, and will continue to get my zombie fix from there.

After having played for a bit I will admit that its fun (I mean when isnt taking out Zombies fun) that alone does not make a 5 star game. The biggest draw backs that stop it from loving up to the hype for me come from two major complaints:\n\n1) Graphics: Given the quests hardware limitations I knew that there was no way the game was going to look as good as all the trailers hyped it up to be. But for a $39 game they are significantly more poor than what I even expected. Things are very boxy and seem unfinished.\n\n2) Movement Controls: The main source of movement in the game is via the joystick to teleport. This teleporting is often limited by silly objects like a car door being in the way. I get that this provides for a more realistic experience but the fact that these objects (mainly doors) are already so awkward to interact with really takes me out of the game.\n\nA 3 star review may seem a bit harsh because like i said i did have a good time playing. That said, when you take into consideration this game costs $39.99 paired with the poor graphics and movement controls it just does not seem the be a proportional experience to cost value.

The game does have some creepy/scary parts but its not too much so dont think that its too scary to play. Im not sure if the game is worth $39.99, maybe $30 or $35( i would recommend buying it on sale) but the game is really fun with more content coming out in the next 3 months so Im excited.

All obstacles are overcome with either a key, a winch handle or a grenade. All too simplistic, and for a $40 title, I expect a richer experience. In addition, I have a real hard time killing zombies when they are right on me. I'm unloading into their head and somehow the bullets are missing them! On the other hand, when they are in a building, I can see their heads and hands through the wall and can shoot them dead before even going into the room.

Not Great.\n\nFirst off, this game looks like a butt. I get the limitations of the hardware, but it also chugs and stutters from time to time. The best games on this platform lean in with style and they jus turned this once beautiful game into a butt.\nThis is clearly an early VR game thats been out for awhile, and Im sure the devs put a ton of work in getting this to run on the hardware. But its hard to justify $40 for this version of the game. Its not terrible exciting or engaging in any element other than the shooting.\nThis is clearly an early VR stepping stone in VR fps and the shooting is done with competence. The only other saving grace is the voiceover of the main protagonist, which helps establish a fun tone throughout the campaign.\nSo I recommend grabbing it on sale.

Glitching into objects was an issue with the teleportation mode on the PC so I tried smooth locomotion on the Quest and glitching is mostly non existent. The textures arent as detailed as the PC version, but doesnt significantly distract from the overall experience. The gameplay is just as smooth and fun as the PC version.\n\nThe reloading is a bit different on the Quest. I found it best to pull the guns into my chest vs down into the belt.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch and enjoyed many oh S@&$! moments.

After doing some research on top VR games on Quest, this game kept popping up in most people's recommendations list. I bought it and I must say, I'm very impressed and having lots of fun with the game. It's not perfect and has its issues, but I can't put it down it's that good. The teleportation style of walking around to explore took some getting used to, but I was scavenging cars and rooms like a pro in a short time.

Also it never hurts to have a bit of a pistol sniping competition taking turns to prove that Im clearly the better shot.\n\nFor an online game to be up and running within 2 hours of release when there are thousands of people trying to get into games is pretty impressive in itself. For the game not to kick us off, glitch or freeze for a 6 hour straight session is unbelievable in my opinion.\n\nAll I can say is thank you to the devs and I hope there will be a sequel or at least a load of DLC to keep it interesting.

Maybe in future, more skins could be unlocked through event completion)\n- Unable to discard unwanted weapons (should be able to throw away the weapons you no longer need or that you accidentally pick up)\n- No melee combat (even Pavlov has a shove mechanic. That's all we need I guess, but melee weapons would be ideal)\n- Zombie types are way too simplistic. They either run, walk or crawl... take something from all the other successful zombie games and give us more types (such as belchers, screamers, juggernauts, etc.)\n- $50AUD/$35USD for a short campaign with little replayability and 3 multiplayer maps is not worth it (I finished the campaign on the hardest difficulty quite quickly and with ease. Add more to the campaign to make it enticing to replay or at least an additional Hardcore difficulty setting)\n- Graphics are not optimised as well as I'd like. While I appreciate that the DEVs definitely optimised a lot and did a tonne of work redesigning a large portion of the game, I still feel like everything is blurry and aiming at range feels uncomfortable at best. Right from their opening logos, everything just loses that crispness evident in so many other games (Drop Dead/Death Horizon/Pavlov all do a better job in this regard)\n\nHelpful | 5", "bondgamesbondMay 2 at 3:34 PM\n*multiplayer only review*\n\nI haven't played this game single player, but multiplayer is extremely fun for the most part.\nWe could see eachothers torch beams in pitch black caves, point them under your own chin for horror stories! Guns are difficult to master the aiming but extremely reliable once you do.\n\nI tend to focus on negatives in reviews, and here they are, but believe me they are outweighed by the fun.\n-about an hour into campaign my coop partner complained that everything was bugged, floating zombies and \"white crap everywhere\"\n- in horde mode zombies will lag about a fair bit, so you think you're safe then suddenly they teleport through the wall at you\n-to reload you basically have to punch yourself in the stomach. You CAN lean forward a bit and do it that way but takes too long. Prepare for bruised abs.\n- You can't drop ammo for your partner(s). If you stash some before finding out they need it badly sucks to be them.\n-campaign is only 2 player co-op. Didn't see that mentioned before buying it and disappointed me a bit. Horde mode is 4 player.\n\nIt looks like a lot of negatives, but these are mostly things I would like acknowledged and addressed.

I was expecting a full length and more varied single player campaign. Although that is a recurring theme in the oculus store, this game being right up there at full pc game cost doesnt sit right with me.\n\nCompleted in one or two sessions and theres not much to go back and replay - as a suggestion it might be an idea to add collectibles/customisations etc to provide a thin layer of RPG-type of depth without having to change much. Obviously more content/areas would be beneficial as well.\n\nI would recommend new owners to hold off for a sale/voucher or check out other cheaper games to get started, there are some for significantly less around 15-25 that offer similar quality with a much longer play time.\n\nAside from the value side of things this is a surprisingly immersive campaign for a zombie shooter, and its interesting to hear the characters attitude change throughout. The ending felt satisfying as did the gun play throughout.\n\nOnly bug I noticed was that entering the radio room crouched rendered the microphone unusable after standing (perhaps my own fault for playing seated without a setting that enables in game standing whilst sitting in the real world...).\n\nGiving star rating independent of price :)\n\nHelpful | 3", "bobbycliffordFeb 16 at 11:54 AM\nThis game is fun\n\nThis game is a fun game but make more campaigns and more to the game.

A nice long campaign to get you comfortable with the mechanics and ready to take on horde mode either alone or with friends. Look for enough faults and you'll find them. Keep in mind the Quest is a standalone WIRELESS unit and therefore comparing graphics to other VR systems is ridiculous. Yes, Arizona will look better on a $3k VR system. But just like those 40 lbs Bell South cell phones from the 90's, the tech will get better and developers will expand horizons \"wirelessly\"! Support the early Quest developers, review games to help developers fine tune them, and give fellow gamers an idea of what's good here.

I hated to throw down forty dollars for it but after reading reviews about the game on Steam I figured it would be money well spent. I was wrong....on every level.

I tried to get a refund almost immediately after realizing I had made a horrible costly mistake however Oculus denied the refund so here's my summary to help others avoid the error I clearly made. Stay away from this game. Seriously, this does nothing to push the zombie genre forward. I feel that this sets back VR gaming by five years. Purchase Robo Recall or Superhot if you haven't already. Even the 'slightly better than tech demo' Vader Immortal is light years ahead of this. Those are must haves while this is a must avoid. Overpriced. Overrated.\n\nHelpful | 60", "VinsoirJan 17 at 8:25 PM\nSuper Fun\n\nIll admit the story does get a little predictable and boring at times but I think its still a decent story.

I personally havent been able to play a game of multiplayer bc it's just dead. Its satisfying to shoot zombie heads and seeing how bullets interact with their bodies. After a bit of plaything tho, I kinda was disappointed with the repetitiveness of this game. The voice acting is great and all but not being able to drop the gun you're holding unless you holster it is immersion breaking to me. The variety of guns is awesome and most of them all handle completely differently but the zombie models get repetitive really fast. Theres whole medkits and canned bean food in the game but you cant do anything with it which is kinda dumb honestly. Over all 2.5/3 out of 5 stars.

One of the major things that annoyed me a little was how occasionally the screen would turn black as if your head was in an object but wouldnt go back to the game. You could shoot and hear the sounds, but you couldnt actually see anything. If your game does have an issue, I found that restating the game usually clears it up.

The mechanics are great, and this is a game unlike any other for the quest! The shooting mechanics are wonderful, unlike the other zombie shooters, which are garbage. If this game had been awful, I would have immediately returned it. But the campaign alone would persuade me to buy the game! The campaign just brings so much new stuff to VR. Its amazing with the different aspects of puzzle solving and zombie shooting that Ive never seen in a game like this before! I feel like with a few adjustments to the fear-factor of the game, this could be a super scary-awesome zombie game! Particularly in the cave level, where its very dark, I feel like they could have added a few jump scares or more noises to spook you, rather then just have this edgy tension where you are anticipating zombies coming from around corners and whatnot, but it never really happens. I feel like this could be a great addition to the game, because there is so much fear instilled in me when a zombie just starts bolting towards you, its bonkers. Like it literally scares the crap out of me and I love it! Anyways, amazing game, but add some more close-quarters combat/contact.

I'm going to also say that there is one small but annoying problem that is that you can't drop guns sure it's not a huge problem but it needs to be fixed because most people don't always want to be holding guns.

I am NOT a gamer. No XBox, no Playstation... I was an NES/Genesis guy. Controls are very intuitive, and the motion is fantastic.

Other than the odd glitch (zombie hands floating through doors, having to reload the game because of a bad load), overall I've been thrilled. The horde mode is super challenging; but I find the frustrations come from what would happen in real life - ammo incompatibility, objects in your way - the realism makes it hard, and the difficulty makes it real.

To pick up your guns again, just put your arms down and press the thumb buttons again. Nice graphics, entertaining voice actors.

Makes this average.\n\nIMO the PSAIM the only dedicated first party, all PS4s buttons are on this (even touchpads), with recoil feedback, haptic feedback on things, a good trigger with not intense LBS. Needed to fire a round off. The PSAIM. Is just an amazing well adopted by devs controller. Probably my favorite \"light gun that isn't a light gun\" VR gun. You feel like you have the firearm in your hand. I tend to sometimes catch myself useing my hands when i use that to do things the various real life actions such as adjusting stock lol. Its great.\n\nAll that said in my brain foggy sick condition, its not bad on quest. The 2H is cool to have as an addition and the way it works is fine but can be a hassle at times. The stock controller helps, but hinders more (for me st least) . If buy it, not cause you played it with the best VR gun controller en mass and expect to get the same thing here. There are quality of life improvements and for that i have a lot of respect. Even minor ones. I noticed the game had less assets like a siccor cart you can pull the lever in the other Versions (lever as far as i know moved just to add to immersion, unless it did something secret which i doubt. The freedom of wires is HUGE. Especially for hand guns. With the PSAIM ,( sorry to keep repeating myself about this controller lol im very sick. Very foggy its driving me nuts . With the PSAIM you have the 2 joysticks to help move and shoot and aim and yada for some reason it had me turning less when i used it. But hand guns id get tangled to point of breaking 3 company PSVR headsets. Kjp has the funds to fix. Lol.\nId say get it. If you like this kinda game, zombies guns. A lot to do. Co op and fun things.

Also interact with objects isn't great, doors pass right through you when they close on there own, the same happens with car boots. Also you are unable to knock over one object with another.

Environments are very well thought out and provide a good atmosphere to play in. My concerns that prevented 5 stars:\n\nGraphics go black when, it seems, your head clips objects in game. Had an issue in a cave when I could hear but all was black until I walked to a different location. Similar issue when I lean to look in a vehicle.\n\nAiming is off when you close your left eye for gun in right hand. Opposite eye seems fine for gun in either hand.\n\nIt would be nice to use objects for melee or noise. You come across pots but cant use them to keep enemies at a distance. Similarly, you find glass bottles you cant use to distract or gather enemies to a location. I think the glass bottles may not be necessary, but melee would be great.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Alexanderrr123Feb 2 at 4:02 PM\nRead before\n\nIt is a great game and I had lots of fun completing it.

There's no issue with my method of payment, but maybe try to look like you care? Or say sorry we couldn't process this reimbursement but please accept this $20 store credit (or something to that effect to make amends).\n\nI've been touting this headset to anyone that will listen, but this has really soured me on the experience.\n\nI'll update if I ever hear from a real person at Oculus.\n\nHelpful | 11", "BeastAtGAMZJan 5 at 12:27 PM\nIts fun!\n\nEver since the first time I played Arizona sunshine, Ive practically fallen in love with the game.

The coop experience is the first quest is my first experience that has satisfied my thirst for a real coop campaign gameplay.\n\nPositives\n\nFun coop gameplay not just horde modes, there isn't anything coop out like this.\n\nI liked the narration of the game, added a lot to the experience\n\n\nNegatives\n\nI got stuck in darkness 2 times in doorways after downloading latest patch, doorways and gates take multiple efforts to get through especially when teleporting. Having to restart the game once after an hour into the coop campaign. Glitches and gun mechanics hopefully will be fine tuned. The reload mechanism is pretty clunky to me, and objects really obstruct you from moving more then they should.\n\nGraphically even for quest standards this should look better, there are some fantastic looking games. Dead and Buried 2 looks amazing, if it had that kind of quality it would blow people's minds.\n\n39.99 is a very high asking price without loads of free DLC. I'm hoping for 2 more hours at least of coop campaign DLC over the next coming months to justified the price tag. I feel 6 hours of campaign gameplay for 39.99 would be a fair price. My buddy and I finished it the first time through in about 2 hours even.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf they follow through with cleaning the gameplay a little and adding a bunch of coop content this game is well worth the 39.99. If they choose not to I think it is about 20 dollars overpriced. A couple of bosses and an occasional person that you run into could spice up gameplay also. Thanks for bringing some real coop play to the quest just need some more content on the campaign. I will update my rating appropriately if there isn't free campaign DLC.\n\nHelpful | 8", "karimpoliakFeb 8 at 11:37 AM\nHow\n\nThe best game and the longist game i have ever played\n\nHelpful | 0", "VehjeJan 6 at 8:54 AM\nShort but good\n\nThe campaign was really good but was played through in a day.

But there are many things to improve upon:\n\n- Lack of variety in zombie types when compared to similar titles. After a while, killing the same types of zombies gets too easy.\n- Due to the aforementioned reason, this made the campaign very dry after a while.\n- Guns should be easily droppable and not glued to your hand. This takes away from the intuitiveness\n- Gun \"variety\" are too similar, we really don't need 10 variation of a pistol where the function is the same. Add guns that have a distinct style of play like grenade launchers, mines, machine guns, etc.\n- Campaign was too short in general at its price\n- More maps in horde mode\n\nHelpful | 0", "noahwoodis2dopeDec 5 at 1:33 PM\nRuns pretty well\n\nThe game runs pretty decently on the quest however, opening doors can be a little laggy.\nThe graphics leave alot to be desired, especially after playing playing a game like Vader immortal.

I was unaffected by the right controller issue.\n\nShout out to the developers for being pro-active on the issues and resolving quickly.\n\nThere were some issues that I faced during game play that i wanted to bring to the developers attention:\n\n1) The game does not re-act well with the Oculus guardian. I felt that every-time I went towards my guardian that the graphics would just show black which got annoying. With small space I do sometimes head towards the guardian by accident however to have the graphics disappear rather than fade was very off putting.\n\n2) LOST Connection we had this a few times and struggled to restore back from it. Going through the guardian completely OR placing your headset down (within the guardian) while you quickly went for a comfort break when you come back your game has Lost connection. It showed me a screen (presume as I was host) when I come back offering me to kick the opposite player. Which I didnt want to do I wanted to continue to play. There should be a re-try option on this page or an option to force it to re-join so we can continue. One of the occasions the batteries in the friends controller had died so he walked out of the guardian area and couldnt recover from this state.\n\n3) During the campaign after leaving the mine you continue onto the roof area where there is a gun on top of the sandbags. From the roof you jump onto boxes the far side upon doing this I got stuck behind the boxes and could not get out. Again, graphics went completely black, when I could see something it was the mountain range and the boxes behind me. I tried re-set Oculus position by holding down the oculus button and tried to walk back through the boxes (Please note I had teleport turned off as I prefer walk) and I couldnt. I had to in the end quit the game as I was getting a little annoyed that I couldnt move out.\n\nAny comments/fixes would be fab!\n\nHelpful | 4", "KT05Jan 28 at 6:39 PM\nGood game\n\nThere are a few flaws in the game but its still a really good game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "sulster4582Jan 22 at 10:54 AM\n\nI've played it start to finish...absolutely loved it and can't wait for the next chapter\n\nHelpful | 0", "LionNavJan 20 at 2:59 PM\nGreat Game\n\nGreat game, I love to play with my friends.

If you can get over the graphics, however, the game is excellent. I had no issues with controls as I did not use the teleport controls and went with the smooth walking ones, I also changed the turning to smooth. The mechanics in the game are great, aiming is nice and feels natural and reloading is a breeze. Interactive objects are everywhere, including hamburger patties to chow down on and car doors/trunks to open everywhere. Mechanics for opening doors, be it car or building, are great and give you a real good feel overall. Nothing is better than cracking open a door an inch, sticking the muzzle of your handgun through, and popping off a couple of zombies. The world in general seems fairly realistic as far as hordes and whatnot are concerned - if a horde is coming you have some space to make decisions on what to do first or where to move to, etc. Some zombies can't be taken down with headshots, but you can always blow legs off to slow them down and other environmental things here and there.

Doesnt happen in other games so must be Arizona Sunshine. Update: it appears the door itself is being taken into account here. Despite my hand being nowhere near the guardian grid it thinks the door is...?\n\n2) The game will quite often go black and force turn me around when I am close to something e.g. drawers, ladders, corner of a room. I am using smooth locomotion.\n\n3) The world goes black if you accidentally put your head through things e.g. into a car, metal fence.

I know you can play the rift version via link, but this is not a game I would personally play attached to a cable.\n\nThe graphics are fairly standard for a Quest game. I'd say, in the range of HL 1.\nThe storyline is solid. The setting is nice and the atmosphere is great. You are alone (in singleplayer mode), going slightly mad and trying to find your way to a safe haven.\nThis makes it better than most zombie games currently available on the quest, which are pretty much target practice.\nWhen it comes to shooting, the weapons behave as they should and you won't be that accurate at long range when using a pistol. It kind of sucks that you can't use melee weapons, which makes me wonder why do you pick up stuff like hammers or pans in the first place.\nMovement has several options. I personally prefer locomotion using head to aim (hand is also an option), but others seem to prefer teleportation. Either way, there are choices. I would really like to know how you sprint in this game, though.\nThe character customization is limited to masks and hats, but I'm hoping there might be some more in the future?\n\nEither way, if there's one thing that makes this game 5 star is the multiplayer.\nCo-op campaign has to be the best gaming experience I've had in the Quest so far.

For example the campaign is a little dry. in my opinion it seems repetitive and most of the things that im doing seem pointless. i constantly find myself walking, looking for a key, finding something unimportant, fighting a small horde, Rince and Repeat. I wish they could add a little more spice to it and not so repetitive but i understand that they can improve it. Some other gameplay issues is i dont love the gun switching thing from hand to hand and i wish i could drop guns. Ive seen people write complaints about the teleporting and ive experienced it, its not that bad but moving with controllers are far easier and provides for a better more immersive experience. Personally I think there should be a melee weapon like a knife that you can use in case you run out of ammo which you do a lot in horde mode. On the other hand though i absolutely LOVE horde mode, especially online because they give you a small amount of ammo (a little too small) and make you manage it and ration it. The map could be bigger and more interactive but there are other maps and improvements can always be made. It relies completely on teamwork and the first game i ever played with others, not only did we coordinate well and have fun. but we also fooled around in between rounds and added each other as friends.

I got a vr to play this which I thought was on oculus quest already and elven assassin. That being said i will be honest.\nThis game is worth the hype if you like wave shooters and guns. I will admit that the graphics are not the best but it's running on a samsung galaxy s8 so I can live with that. Another point to draw attention to is the grenade throwing, it is so hard to throw a grenade far and on top of that the tracking for the gun may not be perfect but it's not bad. Ammo is scarce so savor it. I believe that they will address these problems in updates. This game has been around for a day on quest so give them some slack. I wish you could do horde mode on a different map other than the canyon however. I seem to be able to only play there.\nUpdate: I'm dissatisfied with this. This game has so much hype and first time I played it I decided to do campaign on hard mode, this is way too easy and it's short, honestly the campaign is awful. The other zombie campaigns did it better. You can only play horde mode on one map. You released one of the biggest games of time and you only give us one map. I love the game but for $40 it is not really worth it because you only get $15 of content.\n\n(Update). I still love this game but there are so many things wrong here that trigger me so badly. Graphics are not the best but I can look by that. Grenades are meh but I can get over that. Accuracy is annoying, sometimes you cant shoot a zombie with the gun in your hand so you have to use the gun in your other hand or use a couple of mags to kill the zombie. The next one is the one that really triggers me. I got arizona sunshine for the multiplayer and because its arizona sunshine, however it's getting annoying because people are already cheating. You should not be able to go out side the zone or hide in the boxes. I use to be number one of the leaderboards until this cheat was discovered, now someone made it to wave 170 something because of this cheat. So I ask that you reset the leaderboards every week/month/season or something. And to make it where you cannot cheat or you get kicked out of the game even if you're in campaign or single player. I still believe there is not enough content that was released but whatever they say they are adding more they just need to hurry up. Another annoyance of the game is the physics, the walls and doors are weird and you can go through them, I placed a ball in a cup but it just set above instead of going in, and when you kill a crawler and another zombie is getting close it shows that you are hitting the dead body because the live one is crawling through the dead ones body and that is annoying. Last but not least is something you wouldn't here someone say, make it where you get hit, sometimes if I'm near my box and zombies should of hit me but they didnt because of the box or something invisible blocked them. Please add more maps, I cant survive this game with one map and all the cheating.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper ResponseDec 10 at 7:28 AM\n\nThanks for reporting on the matter; we're currently investigating.

Like somebody said before me, it someehat often has troubke rendering as you're walking which is not super fun on the eyes. My controller also did the thing where thr right one stopped letting me grab (and its never done thst before in another game) but after restarting the game it seems to be resolved, ill have to play more to find out. Overall a pretty fun game but for that price tag it should be much, much smoother\n\nUPDATE: Devs fixed both of the problems I had with the new update. Its no longer choppy and the trigger works fine. The rendering seems just fine now. So definitely reccomend this game and I'm glad to see that the devs so were so quick to jump on issues!\n\nHelpful | 1", "KrymBaltimoreDec 7 at 7:41 PM\nGreat game!\n\nThe devs did a great job on this game! This is one of the games I've been waiting for since I got the quest in July! I am disappointed that I beat it already but I do plan to play again on the highest difficulty and the multiplayer campaign and horde mode (single and multiplayer). I'll even play normal difficulty again. Lol. I just love shooting Freds (you'll get that if you played it). Graphics are good. The way their heads burst when you shoot them is very satisfying. I just wish it was longer. Hopefully there are dlcs coming with more campaigns. I didn't want this to end. That said, there are some bugs. At times I got stuck in doors and other places in the game. The wench to lower the bridge at the mine wasn't in the truck at first even though the voice response seemed to think it was. I had to restart to correct that issue. I also noticed some of the background scenery appear as I got close to it which isn't SO bad to me though I have read complaints about that on reviews for other games so it's worth mentioning. If you like zombie games like I do, this game is a must! All of these things i listed as cons are not enough to make this a bad game. I recommend it highly and look forward to more fun shooting the hell outta them zombies. Oh and I'm dying to play multiplayer so send me a friend request if you buy it and we can try it together.\n\nHelpful | 0", "007jonnyboy117Dec 5 at 6:07 PM\nGreat game\n\nI loved this game on the HTC vive at an arcade. It is the whole reason I got a Quest. My biggest complaint is that the graphics feel like the late 80s. The quest sells with 64 or 128 gigs of storage, why can they not add more graphics into the game, add some more gigs to the game and make it a AAA game. Overall, this game is the best vr game period!

The campaign was incredibly short for me. No one ever plays multiplayer and I was under the assumption that it was an open world game which it was described as. So I was incredibly disappointed and I tried to stick it out and play multiplayers and horde mode. But the game crashes even with the awful graphics turned all the way down. I would rather have my money back but I already invested too much time into the game. I really really hope that drastic changes come to this game for the simple fact that the open world concept wouldve floored other games and made this one amazing. Almost like a VR dayz. But that didnt happen. Wouldnt recommend.

I was very disappointed after 30 minutes of playing the campaign mode which made me feel sick and dizzy. I then took a 30 minute break and tried out the horde mode. That's the only reason (horde mode) why I ended up keeping the game; otherwise, I would have refunded it. The horde mode is worse than the zombie horde mode in pavlov vr on sidequest especially because of the annoying exploit (bug) that a lot of users take advantage of. I'm referring to hiding in the box by walking inside it with the 6dof which makes it so that zombies can't hurt you. It's crazy that pavlov's zombie mode is better than this game because it's free, and yet, this game is ~ $40 and most of the DLC will NOT be free, so I feel kind of ripped off. I'm afraid that I'll even end up getting bored of horde mode because there's only one location. There's very limited ammo, so it would have been nice to have some kind of melee in this game, but unfortunately that will never happen according to the developer AMAs on reddit. I wanted to like this game a lot, but I just can't, surprisingly. It's kind of fun, but just okay; hence why I'm giving this game a 2/5 stars, and that's probably being generous considering that it's ~ $40 versus pavlov vr which is free. UPDATE: wasted over 1 hour in campaign after getting back into it because of an annoying bug (winch is non-existent in the trunk of the car), so I had to restart the campaign for it to reappear. The campaign mode is very boring and tedious; it feels more like a searching game versus a zombie shooter because most of the time you have to look for keys, winches, c4, etc. The campaign mode is also the first vr experience that made me sick enough to actually throw up, and I think I have pretty good vr legs (i play games like pavlov with locomotion controls without feeling sick). The campaign is the worst vr experience imho.\n\nHelpful | 5", "madco2006Dec 25 at 6:33 PM\nSick brov\n\nI think its should be more of the campaign because me and my brother beat it online in one day.

It's good... but that's the best superlative I can muster for it. Maybe at a time when there were less VR games, this was definitive, as I've seen it referred to in VR communities. But what I played was a pedestrian zombie shooter with effectively 3 gun types (Shotgun, pistol, Rifle, and each individual weapon with different ammo counts and damage) and minor replayability. (Oh, I did find a grenade launcher, and that was fun for the 1 tunnel level) The campaign is OK... I guess it gets extra praise because it resembles the general structure of a console shooter campaign but much more simplistic. I'd be more impressed if it was a looting survival game like Day Z or 7 Days to die, but it's just linear while you shoot and scavenge for bullets. Ok, but not amazing. Overall, console style shooter campaigns are a pretty boring genre to shoot for. Horde mode is fine, it's just a small 5ft by 8ft area or so you are confined to, with pre-determined weapon progression. I'm not even sure there is more than 1 level so far.

They arent brilliant but what do people expect from what is essentially a mobile device game. It looks good enough to play and Im happy enough for the downscaling to bring this game to the wireless market, albeit it at a stupid price.\n\nThe game is more or less the same as what PC gamers have had for more than a year. Its fun blasting zombies and, thankfully, multiplayer works - although so far not many players but hoping it gets busier.\n\nWhat is almost the deal breaker for me though is the aiming. On the PC it feels solid and headshots, even at a distance, are good. Here, I can have a Fred right in front of me, blasting it in the face and STILL miss. This has happened both in single player and multiplayer and, given how other quest shooting games are spot on, Im unsure as to whether this is a deal breaker or not as it really gets infuriating at times.\n\nWhen it works and the aiming suddenly seems on point its a fun title but, with the flaws, I wouldnt say it is worth 30; certainly not if you had already purchased it via steam when it first came out.\n\nHelpful | 3", "LiamGallagherJan 1 at 2:16 PM\n\nVery cool great game just think that it is a bit to pricey and it repeats itself a few times but other than that it is a good solid game\n\nHelpful | 0", "KronikRenoDec 6 at 10:06 PM\nLower graphic quality better gameplay\n\nwell the graphics quality is noticeably lower in some spots the overall gameplay is definitely improved from psvr and traditional PC.

However that's not the reason for 1 star review since I can live with that. Yeah it's a pain and hassle but it hasn't happened that often and restarting the quest fixes it.\nReason for 1 star is a major stutter problem. When I move all objects around me start to stutter (rapidly moving from left to right, getting all blurry). It isn't constant but I get it for at least 80% of time through my gameplay. Also it isn't area specific. Sometimes i go through one area and everything is fine, then everything in the same area starts to stutter then all of a sudden same area is back to being normal again. This all happens throughout the same playthrough so it isn't some overheating problem or anything similar.

I enjoy the zombie survival genre and with VR, there is incredible opportunity for all us zombie fans to live out our zombie apocalypse fantasies without the emotional baggage of the end of society as we know it.. Arizona Sunshine is a real beacon to what VR can bring in this genre. Its fun, relatively realistic and keeps bringing me back. But there is one major flaw with this game that is a real head slapper. Apparently, for some reason, it didnt occur to the developers to enable players to drop unwanted weapons. Whether it be to upgrade, or your just sick of the gun... there is NO way to discard a weapon. Now, if your gun belt is full (4 firearms), the gun your holding will swap out with a new one your picking up, but thats only if your swapping it. Otherwise, there is no way to get rid of it. This means that if you have 4 weapons, your double fisting 2 with zero choice. So if Im holding a rifle in one hand, and a pistol in the other, your stuck that way. This is terrible game design. The devs really need to fix this.

The gunplay is snappy and satisfying, as well as impressively accurate. Everything about the gameplay is relatively strong, but the lacking campaign simply isnt long enough to justify the $40 price tag. It seems to end right at the point where the story would become interesting, and when the game seems to hit its stride. All in all, it was incredibly disappointing to complete the bulk of the game within such a short time, especially considering how enjoyable the game was up until that point. The horde mode offers a certain degree of replayability, but leaves me wondering why I didnt purchase one of the various other, substantially cheaper zombie shooters. Other minor complaints include some buggy interactions with certain objects (most notably doors) and strangely long load times, even for the Quests relatively slow processor.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Mr_kotswinkleJan 3 at 5:57 PM\n\nIt looks a bit blocky especially the hands\n\nHelpful | 0", "Garykrishna50Jan 5 at 1:55 AM\n\nAmazing game love it\n\nHelpful | 0", "jesuslugoDec 5 at 10:50 AM\nMultiplayer mode not functioning\n\nI'd give this game a better review but the co-op servers aren't functioning.\n\nHelpful | 13\nDeveloper ResponseDec 5 at 1:18 PM\n\nHi jesus, just to update you on the matter, the matchmaking servers should be up and running!", "Crossedhalo7543Dec 5 at 6:26 PM\nVery satisfying\n\nThe game felt great and had much better story telling than expected, the graphics have suffered on this version compared to the Rift but after playing for Abit you don't notice it much\n\nHelpful | 0", "rex2806Dec 22 at 4:56 PM\n\nLove this game so many things to do and its a so much fun to play with friends\n\nHelpful | 0", "KingBigSteelDec 31 at 10:02 PM\nZomberz\n\nAbsolutely must for the oculus quest\n\nHelpful | 0", "Pearso52Dec 13 at 11:04 AM\nGood but too short\n\nFirstly Ill say i really enjoyed this game BUT the gameplay on the story mode was pitifully short.
