After college, wherever I lived, I always tried to find a local boxing gym. They are usually difficult to find and, unless you live in a city, a far drive. As the years went by, I eventually stopped looking for boxing clubs. I bought a heavy bag once but it never got much use. I realized I would never box in a competition again due to my profession. I recently bought the Oculus at 40 years old due to my love of video games and fascination with VR. I saw this game and just had to buy it. And, fellow oculus owners, saying this is an INCREDIBLE game is an understatement. This game makes me feel young again. Hitting the heavy bag or focus ball with the trainer in the background inside this small little boxing establishment is just unreal. The developer NAILED the environment. If you ever wanted to know what it feels like to train in a little boxing gym, this game does it. And, then, fighting in an actual boxing match...are you kidding me???? I felt like I was having flashbacks. This game had me sweating and ready to die at the end of the third round after minutes of bobbing/weaving while throwing jabs and hooks. Being able to put my gloves in the air after the win and walking around the ring with my trainer giving me the thumbs up was just too freaking awesome. This game deserves more than 5 stars. Thank you developer. You really did it with this one!\n\nHelpful | 65", "Puerto-the-RicoJun 25 at 8:57 AM\nThe best boxing game on the market!\n\nYou will not find a boxing game thus far with the same level of intensity for this price tag! First and foremost to the developers. Thanks! This game hits its marks where it counts the most! The core of that being boxing! With games like creed merely offering an Arcade style feel this game truly delivers!\n\nMy Big take aways from this game:\n\n1. Technique. This games offers a far more authentic feel from how hard you throw punches to jabs and setups to dodging and counter punching your opponent.\n\n2. The training area helps you gauge techniques. I personally believe it would be nice if your coach actually gave you tips and strike patterns while you train in the gym. Even highlight areas on the heavy bag or B.O.B (body opponent bag) maybe even have the coach holding strike pads and work combinations with you including bob and weave tech.\n\n3. Cardio intensity. There is nothing quite like fighting an opponent to really get the heart rate up. There are plenty of cool workout games on the VR that will make you sweat but none so far compare to this. In fact I feel the workout long after Im done playing. That alone is worth the price tag!\n\n4. Visual damage to the opponents. You can see what damage your opponent is taking and capitalize on it. Bust up his left eye? Most likely his defenses on that side may be more lacking.\n\n5. Smart AI. Your opponent will begin to catch on to your strike patterns. Like a real fight the longer the match goes on the more your opponent is gonna learn you. This encourages switching it up.\n\n6. Larger room scale makes for more movement and authenticity. Nothing quite like feeling like your in a real ring.\n\nI would love to see more updates and opponents. Maybe new fight venues and as mentioned earlier actual interaction from the coach. Maybe a training mode for those new to the game with no prior technique. Videos or tips from actual boxers, etc.\n\nGreat game guys cant wait to see what else you guys are cooking up!!\n\nHelpful | 105", "alphawavJul 17 at 10:06 AM\nExcellent Game cant wait for Part 2\n\nExcellent game. Physics, and everything  on point.\n\nNeeds trainer talk (with an option to turn off)\nNeeds multiplayer like right now (yesterday)\n\nNeeds a randomizer so you can fight unlimited opponents for life and not the same ones over and over\n\nNeeds a career mode with a simple story\n\nBy far better than any other title\nDevs KOed all the other boxing games in this VR platform\n\nHelpful | 23", "iGotticJun 5 at 9:21 AM\nBest Boxing Game, but needs multiplayer\n\nIan Fitz did an amazing job. It feels nice (no locomotion, yay!), punches register and do damage properly, the health system isn't linear (trauma is more realistic), and round system is good.\n\nHowever, it doesn't offer replay-ability after you defeat all guys on outclassed difficulty. I really wish a multiplayer was added. The only boundary I see on multiplayer is the play area of both players, but I would just require a minimum play area size and usage of the smaller play area for the match.\n\nHelpful | 76", "nate.hoodsieJul 6 at 2:43 PM\nBest budget game for the quest\n\nI have a lot to say about this game but no one reads long reviews so Ill try to cut it short:\n- For the price of 9.99, there is fighting against the bots, difficulty settings, training sessions, etc.\nWhat I love about Thrill Of The Fight rather than any other boxing game on the market is you use YOUR stamina rather than a predetermined stamina by the game. Aside from that big factor, the fighting aspect is so much better than Creed or Knockout League.\n\nOnly thing Id say more is make sure you have a large area for the game. You want maybe at least 4x4ft so you dont hit your surroundings (experienced it firsthand). Automatic buy 5/5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 15", "dan31415Jul 26 at 8:14 PM\nUse real boxing gloves\n\nPro tip: buy 16oz training gloves and wedge the game controllers in the little loop between the thumb and fingers. The virtual gloves in the game match up with the real gloves exactly. The menus in the game are designed to be punched with the gloves so none of the buttons are needed.\n\nExcellent boxing simulator.\n\nHelpful | 5", "jroger.hay.12 days ago\nIncredible\n\nI love this game/trainer!\n\nIf youve checked out the Creed demo and were likewise put off by the stamina gauge (and overall video game feel), this title is for you.\n\nMy son and I have used Thrill of the Fight to round out our Covid-quarantine workout: Beat Saber for cardio and stretches :)\n\nIts such an incredible use of the control sensors to match your actual strong punches to the games strong punches. Youll really feel like youre in the ring with this one.\n\nHelpful | 0", "lazy_pants_666Jul 19 at 4:39 PM\nNumber one workout game\n\nThis game is a masterpiece. The challengers are very easy in the beginning but getting much more intense along the way. First it start with 2 easy rounds but later it will be 5 rounds at 3 min each.\nPrepare to sweat a loooooooooot!\n\nIt really trains your reflexes and footwork. It's impossible to score a knockout if you don't punch intensively. There are side games like punching bag or dummy bag that tell you how strong and accurate you punched.\n\nMy favourite about this game is after game statistics. It will tell you how many heavy punches, how many jobs, knockdowns and overall accuracy. Your opponent is often in the 100% range, which makes it difficult to block at first.\n\nLove this game and it's worth every penny. If you want to workout, this is your game.\n\nHelpful | 5", "MTambieJul 8 at 11:41 AM\nThe most realistic boxing game!\n\nThe main reason I decided to purchase the Oculus Quest was when I heard about Thrill of the Fight and the game did not disappoint. The gameplay is very challenging (like real boxing) and the outcome of each fight depends on your level of skill and fitness. This is the first boxing game that has no energy reading/level. You need to be patience and set up your punches/combos and target the opponent's weak areas.\n\nIn terms of fitness, playing the game for a little over an hour I burned around 700 calories. It can definitely be used as an avenue to gain endurance, strength, and also weight loss.\n\nThere is always room for improvement. A multi-player mode and a career mode would be a fun addition with a bit more excitement when you defeat an opponent, especially the reigning champion. In terms of the gameplay, my uppercuts almost never touch the opponent and I can't parry punches or pull down the opponent's guard (like Vasiliy Lomachenko :D ) when he's just blocking punches.\n\nOverall, this game is one of a kind and definitely the best boxing game ever developed. I really hope a Thrill of the Fight 2 is in development. Definitely 5 stars from me!\n\nHelpful | 8", "geek_angelo2 days ago\nMy Quarantine Routine.\n\nI love this game. For only $10 it's the best deal on the Quest.\n\nIt's a great game on it's own, but it's also an amazing cardiovascular workout. After a fight I'm usually dripping in sweat, and it's been very satisfying going from breathing too heavy to finish fights of normal mode, to not needing to rest between rounds on Endurance mode. It's like real conditioning.\n\nAnd getting a knockout feels earned. It's so satisfying. Just buy this game, it's only $10 but is worth a lot more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Jesterado2 days ago\nCardio to the Max\n\nYou might want to keep your hands up, because, hands down this is the best cardio work out, disguised as a game I have played. Besides the intense exercise, you get a truly great VR experience with Thrill of the Fight. From a sense that youre actually hitting something to trying to put everything you got into hitting it, you are keyed on your warm ups, focused on your opponent, changing tactics as he starts to figure you out, you know your in the middle of it. I would recommend getting a silicon mask cover to prevent the large amount of sweat from permeating your headset foam padding. I wasnt looking for a cartoony fight game and this fits that bill. Realistic fighting and the stamina is all you. When you go a hard three rounds and win, you feel that youve earned it. Definitely one of my faves as well as an awesome daily workout.\n\nHelpful | 0", "doctoroculo3 days ago\nBest boxing game since Fight Night Rnd 3\n\nBest boxing game since I played fight night round 3. I love the immersive experience. It's a real work out. The boxing dummy is awesome for practicing hooks, uppercuts and learning stance and measuring reach. Using it to train my 13yr daughter she's learned her punching reach, distance and stance, believe the hype, game cheap and on point.\n\nHelpful | 0", "BrenKotlang4 days ago\nAwesome realistic boxing!\n\nI bought the Oculus Quest having in mind of course the VR fun and awe, but also as a way to have some fun exercising. The first week I saw this game in a bundle so I decided to give it a try. Man I got blown away with the way this game makes you feel. Throwing punches at the air has never been this entertaining!\n\nYou get the feel of fighting against a real opponent. What I loved most about this game is the realism, not in graphics but experience-wise. You can see your opponent getting bruised by your punches, you know when he is pain and changes his defense if youve been throwing a lot of punches to an area. You can dodge his punches and trick him into punching him so he drop his guard to punch you and take advantage of that. The dynamics In getting hit or knocked out makes it feel so realistic as well!\n\nI tried the CREED demo and while it has better graphics and other dynamics I didnt like that it has stuff like bullet time or that your character can get tired. That is such a turn off in a game like this. Thrill of the fight really lets you get your heart pumping max, sweat like crazy and get excited over knocking out an opponent. If you get tired its up to you and you have to deal with the consequences xD. This game deserves 10 stars, the developers and artists did a pristine job on this one. Congratulations and thank you for the hours of fun and sweat. Buy it now, theres no second thoughts with this one and no regrets at all. Youll love it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "hellokien4 days ago\nBest VR Boxing...\n\nFirst off. $10 makes this an easy bargain to try. Doesnt have the name power of Creed, but it doesnt need it.\n\nIve played the full version of Creed and Knock-Out League and it felt like boxing with the Nintendo Wii 10 years ago.\n\nIm so much more engaged here in the fights. Im in excellent boxing condition in real life and Im pouring after two fights going for the knockout victories.\n\nThe heavy bag and focus ball are pretty realistic too but I always just go straight for the fight to get the max HR workout.\n\nThe only fault I can see is that I can overwhelm the opponents with offense and dont have to focus on defense as much as long as I have the real life stamina to keep going non stop for 3 minutes.\n\nIts also hard to tell if Im actually dodged a punch or if our spacing was just off. The same goes with uppercuts. I cant ever seem to land them but hooks are great.\n\nThe AI does react to your punches so its easy to game if youve got a lot of stamina. I always go for a fast body punch and hook to the head combo.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite go to games on the Quest for a good workout.\n\nI also have BoxVR/FitVR. Thats great for a gym like boxing workout, but I still cant sweat as fast as doing a fight in this game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "RFGRaven6 days ago\nThis game is AMAZING\n\nYou NEED to buy this game now if you like boxing at all I was debating between creed and thrill of the fight and after getting thrill of the fight I realized how much better it is, first of all theres no in built stamina bar, the stamina in game is your stamina as a person, there are tons of different options and as far as I can tell it is an insanely realistic game, the only SLIGHT problem I have is no multiplayer if they added that this game would define perfection but I guess that would be a little harder because there arent really player models the best that you could do would be to choose what character from the 10ish characters that you fight in the game but even if that is all thats possible\nfor player models it would still be perfection but yes to anyone looking for a boxing game, BUY THRILL OF THE FIGHT NOWWWW\n\nHelpful | 0", "DiggyP895 days ago\nA must try on the quest\n\nThis game holds up really well. The graphics arent as polished as creed but this game puts you in the action. There are no controls for movement so the game puts you in the center of the ring once the rounds start. I would recommend getting this game if your not interested in the story creed has and dont care for a game telling you when your hands should be tired. This game is a lot of fun and even tells you how fast your throwing punches. Theres a few things to play with like a speed bag and heavy bag. And the harder your hitting the more obvious it is when your landing punches. I was surprised when tagging a guy in the same spot over and over its fairly realistic. Its a great way to burn some calories and work up a sweat. Be prepared for your arms to be jello after going a few rounds if youve never boxed in VR before lol.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Mattplus097 days ago\nDone Buying Quest Software!\n\nI won't buy anymore quest software and will detatch from the oculus product line since they will make facebook membership mandatory by 1 Jan 2023 for current users and this year for new buyers.\n\nReview\n\nThis is perfect for anyone that enjoys the mechanics of boxing and wants to raise their fitness level. As someone in their fifties, I understand the need to go slow and build up stamina and hope to make boxing into a daily routine. Never buy a game based soley upon how many stars it has...use some common sense...most people who understand what their getting into will love this and the price is great!\n\nHelpful | 0", "ragnar20216 days ago\nA diamond that is rough around the edges\n\nI have to admit this is probably my sole reason for buying the quest and it has lived up to my expectations. For this price I wasn't expecting a perfect game but a simulation that feels real enough to be fun to play. Where I can at least pretend to be a boxer.\nI have to say my greatest moment yet was fighting the Duke on the toughest difficulty setting. For the first time I had to actually out box my opponent because I was loosing everytime trying going into a slugfest with him.\n\nIf I can have a wishlist for an update or the next game it would be.\n\n* unique opponents with unique styles\n* perhaps some more feedback in the controls during critical moments\n* some more effects on face and body when you connect\n\nThx for a great game!\n\nHelpful | 0", "SiinoEvilA day ago\nThe thrill is definitely a fight!\n\nYou gotta stick and move son!

I stopped using my heavy bag and use this exclusively for my cardio boxing workouts. I just wish there were more opponents to fight. I know each of them has four levels but Id rather different guys just get harder. Something minimal.\n\nHelpful | 2", "charles.menifee.9813 days ago\nFantastic boxing game\n\nI played this for over an hour and went through all of the fighters, Im still sore lol. Great game, its very realistic. Its like youre actually boxing and your stamina, is your actual stamina with the caveat that theres little resistance. I love games like this because it allows you to emerge yourself into the moment and you burn a lot of calories doing so. I think I burned about 1,000 calories with this game. If I could improve anything, I would add more fighters, improve the dodge tracking, improve the uppercuts and make it easy to update your name versus being the player. I took martial arts for years and I can tell you that most of the fighting mechanics are pretty realistic. I also love the fact that each boxer is different and theres different ways of attacking each. Easy must buy.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Philligan8114 days ago\nBest Boxing Game for sure\n\nThis is a great game! I really wanted to like Creed, but it is weak and very poorly thought out.

In shadow fight you imagine your opponent, control your fine mooves etc. Here you have opponents in your shadow fight. Yes you dont feel the punches. But for fun training purposes its great. I used to warm up make some minutes in the gym, do a sparring fight of 3 rounds against the fat guy and then a competition fight. As more you go on as more opponent choices you have.

That said, I really love this game. It's fun and immersive, and it's a workout. The graphics are a little cartoonish, which to me adds to the sense of fun, but it's just realistic enough in its damage modeling to give you the sense that your punches are having an effect (cuts on the cheek, swollen eyes, bloody nose, red marks on the body) that it's encouraging without being too much for more sensitive people. Prior to getting my Quest, I've been doing Body Combat workouts and the like, but struggle to stay motivated. Put these VR palookas in front of me, though, and I can go fight after fight. Truly exhausting and fun at the same time. Even my 13-year-old, who usually argues about doing exercise, is willing to wear himself out playing this game, really throwing his heart into it. I particularly like that there are no unnecessary game mechanics ported from consoles, like \"stamina\" for your character, since in VR you really ARE your character, so artificial stamina is not required. Anyway, if you're interested at all in a game of this kind, I highly recommend it. It's also cheap (sometimes maybe free?), so there's that, too.\n\nHelpful | 0", "imtinyrickbittch20 days ago\nAmazing!\n\nThis is realistic as if youre in an actual fight!

The damage is different by how hard you do and realistic!! *why its such a good workout.\n\n\nIf youre debating between this and Creed I say get this.

You can make it easy and just tap your opponent, or you can do it the hard way and fight it out! Even on easy difficulty, this game can be a workout. You are effectively shadowboxing, but I love that you have an opponent that you have to strategize to take down.There is no real story, there are multiple types of workouts, and the graphics are on par with most oculus quest games.

It gets boring after 1 minute of just hitting a bag EX.3 minutes and 1 minute timer rest bell. (Not sure it's there is one already, but I haven't been able to find one) I would love to be able to adjust a timer bell to whatever minutes and seconds I choose.Please add music to choose from as well while training in the gym. Most boxing gyms have music, usually hip hop.\nAlso we need more sparring partners and fighters to choose from. (Not much there)\nAnd last, WHERE ARE THE FEMALE FIGHTERS TO CHOOSE FROM???? Please let us into this game! There are soooo many of us female boxers dominating the sport now. And I believe there are more females who are using the Oculus as a way to work out. Some women would feel uncomfortable that a man is throwing punches at them. Me myself don't because I'm use to sparring with men anyway.

I use my fitness watch to track heart rate/calories burned and it is a scorcher! I probably dont have to punch as hard as I do, but with the opponent right there in my face I cant help but get into it! I am dripping wet with sweat after an hour of playing and I ended up buying a silicone cover because of how sweaty I was getting the face pad. I love that you can customize the number of rounds, length of rounds, and rest, so you can make this workout fit your level.\n\nFeel: You can get into a good stance, move around the ring, and throw natural feeling punches even with the controllers. Great for working punches and foot work. The different opponents make you change up your game. I love that you can see the damage inflicted and the fuzziness you get when taking hits. It is cumulative so the more damage inflicted, the more likely for a knockdown later in the game (on either side).\n\nDetail: It is great to get to see the scorecard and stats after a bout although Im still confused how I can inflict so much more damage and have our scores be so close. Is it % accuracy?\n\nReplay-ability: After you work through the various opponents, then you can start moving up in difficulty. Ive really enjoyed the Endurance level and keep going back to the Outclassed even though Im often not successful. You can also customize your opponents settings to change things up. I dont see myself getting bored!\n\nTraining: It has the heavy bag, speed bag, focus ball, and dummy that give you some stats on your punches. I get bored with this very quick and just use it to warm up a bit before a fight. Its cool that the game has this, but dont think this is where the fun is move on to the fights!

If you do a quick jab with the hand you have forward, the punch is going to have a lot less strenght than with the other one if you move your waist. I guess it's based on speed plus how long the hand is displaced for the punch, but it shows. Moreover, if you hit with the same hand with and without using your waist, there's still some difference in the damage.\n\nHow do I know about the strenght that the game measures for each punch? Other than the matches, you have training options. The boxing sack one shows you a numeric value of the strenght that it's assigning to the punch, so you can see when you're doing more or less damage.\n\nIt's also a great decision to not add a stamina bar or anything like that; the way that you get tired is.. well, you get tired.

There is a little bit of a learning curve, in that you need to know where and how to hit your opponent.\n\nI am currently working my way up beating the opponents in endurance mode. As I get better, it does sometimes seem like they're not doing enough to block my wide punches, but I guess if they did I wouldn't be able to beat them.\n\nIf I could suggest an improvement, it would be to add a couple more venues and slightly more ingeresting looking bystanders.\n\nThere are some instances of swings being missed, but I'm not sure if that's a Quest tracking issue or a game issud. I have added the rubber band hack to prevent the batteries slipping, so I don't think that's the issue. I'm wondering if sometimes as I'm winding up a punch, my controller leaves the trackable view?\n\nSometimes, it also feels like the opponent is coming too close to my face, to the point where its awkward and I feel they want to kiss me. Can't blame them, though, I am very cute, probably a 5 out of 7.\n\nI also have Creed, which visually is much better, but the boxing gameplay is way better in TotF. I wish those two games would have a baby, getting the visuals from Creed, and the boxing simulation from TotF.\n\nIt is the most worth it game in my library, and if you like punching people, knocking them down, and sweating profusely, this is the game for you.\n\nLooking forward to TotF2!

It's a hell of a workout. After three rounds, I'm sweating profusely and need a rest. I could barely move my arms the day after I first tried the game! The gameplay is immersive and feels about as close to boxing as possible without actually stepping into an actual ring. In all honesty, it's not a game. It's a workout, boxing simulation. I don't play this for fun but I will continue to use it to improve my fitness. For this purpose it's fantastic.\n\nAs for improvements I'd like to see:\n\nI have had one issue (happened on a couple of occasions) where one of my gloves gets stuck and I have to try and punch my way to get it back or try pressing the Oculus button to fix.\n\nI'd like to see the crowd tweaked so that they each are posed slightly differently from each other with different expressions. At the moment they all look like they are possessed and ready to tear you to pieces.\n\nHaving a trainer work with you in the gym and offer you tips would be much more immersive and add extra value to the game. I doubt it would be too difficult to implement either.\n\nIn any case, it's a recommended buy.\n\n*I originally gave this 4 stars but I'm increasing it to 5 because given the price of this game there's nothing to compete with it on a price/performance basis.

I just want to mention that the opponent is moved into your play area at the beginning of the round so that you don't really have an opportunity to swing at them while they're outside your boundaries. In an earlier version of the game, the opponent did walk out, but many players were immediately rushing forward to meet them and swinging outside of their play area. With the minimum recommended play area size, the opponent shouldn't be in your face after he's moved in, and you should be outside of each others' ranges. Make sure you're standing at the back edge of your play area, and if needed use the \"In-Match Turn Direction\" setting to rotate your play area in the match to give yourself a deeper play area so that the opponent starts farther away. I agree with the body blows! Making them more effective made it way too easy to take the opponents down do to there being so many available high-effect targets. The opponent just isn't a capable enough defender to handle it.", "vangogh25Jul 13 at 4:20 PM\nThoroughly enjoying\n\nThis game is definitely a active one you will sweat.

Uppercuts are a bit of a special issue, as the opponent's chest doesn't stop your real-life hand, so it's hard for the game to tell if you're punching into their chest or just sliding along it. I think it can be greatly improved, though. I haven't heard a lot of feedback about dodging problems, but I think just having more granular physics interactions and more polished AI movement is going to help that, too.", "Dripp.exeJul 20 at 4:28 PM\nIncredible\n\nPhysics make it feel real along with its easy to navigate menus.\n\nHelpful | 0", "BladeRunner77Jul 28 at 7:18 PM\nFinally\n\nBy far the best game to workout with!\n\nHelpful | 1", "QDaBeatJul 22 at 11:27 AM\nPlease add pvp\n\nPlease add multiplayer for amazing replay vaLue\n\nHelpful | 0", "mitchellrayMay 31 at 2:51 PM\nOne of the best fitness games in VR\n\nI play TOTF at least 3x/week at 30min each session...its the best workout!

Almost the entire rating is because of the low cost. You pretty much have no reason to keep your gloves up for defense because on higher settings it takes every punch you have to end a fight early. I guess that aspect simulates real boxing, but I don't find it particularly fulfilling to exhaust yourself for 3 rounds just to get that one knockdown. After the first knockdown, the next 2 are pretty easy for the TKO.\n\nYou have to do the dummy drill to find out where to hit. Basically the jab and chin shots are 1/3 less damage than hooks to the ribs or temple.\n\nIt's great for the money but not particularly fulfilling. I get a lot more of the feels playing Creed (granted for 3 times the cost) and get that 2nd round knockout in a big venue against a real character. I probably get more of a workout from Thrill of the Fight, but it's just from throwing mindless haymakers for 3 rounds.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 16 at 7:37 AM\n\nThanks for your honest review. You and the opponent don't have health bars, and you're not really \"inflicting\" the points of damage you see on the boxing dummy. Instead, each of your hits is looked at individually to see what effect it had. You do wear the opponent down a bit with each hit to make them easier to hurt with future hits, and as you found you can play by throwing endless haymakers and hoping to completely wear them down before you exhaust yourself (and some people genuinely love to play that way), but you aren't expected to. Try taking fewer swings (aim for 30 to 50 landed per 3 minute round) and focusing on moving around your play area and looking for openings in your opponent's defense to throw purposeful, full-body, precisely-aimed shots at those weak areas. The higher settings you mention are generally intended for exercise or unfair challenge, which is why they're called Endurance and Outclassed instead of \"Hard\" and \"Very Hard\", and those two do require you to wear your opponent down before you can hurt them. Normal mode is the one the game is balanced around, and you can KO your opponent with your first swing if you manage to land the perfect shot to the side of the chin (which is extremely hard to pull off). Note that the side of the chin is the most devastating spot to hit on the opponent's head, and there is no weak spot for the ribs - just the liver on the right side of the body. Also while you're punch strength is important, you don't need to swing as hard as you can, and the game works better if you don't. Just swing at a comfortable level of effort, try to create openings, and aim for those weak areas. The more you move around and play the part of a real boxer, the more enjoyable the game should be.", "n0clipJun 21 at 2:56 PM\nMost accurate fighting game to date\n\nThrill of the fight is without a doubt the most accurate boxing simulation out there.

To select menu options, you walk up and touch them with your gloves. It basically works like a big phone touch screen.

Overall a good game with some solid tracking.\n\nHelpful | 0", "dwl123Apr 23 at 10:48 PM\nAmazing (6 month update)\n\nUpdate:\n\nI still play this game religiously. I expected that. But what I didn't expect is that it's actually making me a better boxer. It still doesn't replace actual sparring and bag work. But it 1000% replaces shadow boxing.\n\nMy upper back and shoulders are actually bigger than they've ever been. Throwing with 100% power is not easy without something to actually impact. Especially if you have a virtual opponent just waiting for you to over commit and throw yourself off balance.\n\nAlso, since the VR goggles handicap my peripheral vision, it forces me to up my ringmanship game.\n\nFinally, I'm also impressed with the effectiveness of feinting. Which I imagine it's a really tough thing to get right. After I had progressed though the difficulty levels, opponents started beating me to the punch pretty often near the end of my sessions when I was wiped out. At times, almost like they were in my head.\n\nBut I started to add in the feints that I had previously abandoned and, what do you know, it worked! I was getting countered a lot less and finding more openings. Buying myself a bit of breathing room at the same time. Just like happens to me in real sparring. Feint early and often, kids. Before it becomes necessary. It's a lesson I seem to learn over and over.\n\n\nI think it's safe to say that this game has made me a better boxer. And I'm pretty sure my hooks would crack rocks right now. :)\n\n\nOriginal post:\n\nI used to box at a boxing gym regularly. I recently moved across the country for work and haven't found a gym to regular quite yet and have been missing it quite a bit.\n\nWhat a joy to find this game! It's obviously not the real thing. It doesn't quite trigger the same reflexes as a real person would. But it's actually close enough that I feel like I'm maintaining some base skill/fitness level with the game alone.\n\nI generally do 10-20 rounds every day and try to maintain a 1x multiplier. So it kicks my butt pretty good. But it's so convenient/rewarding that I actually do it. And generally look forward to it.\n\nIt's brought something back in to my life that I've missed and has helped me to feel more complete. Thank you, Ian! Keep up the amazing work. Maybe one day the technology will support shoulder rolls. :)\n\nHelpful | 0", "Lmeduri23 days ago\nGame has no physics\n\nHow tf do I refund this garbage.

But dang.. like shadow boxing on sonic style! When I try to imagine an opponent shadow boxing it's alright, but when I see an opponent in a space and time that is so closely correlated with my reality my enjoyment, speed, and concentration bounds forward! Just finish Luis (4th in I think) and I'm noticing trends. Even when I lay out 20 hit uninterrupted combos (not too hard to do when you get a grasp for their timing and styles) barely a dent in the head. Yet I notice when they leap forward and strike they land big shots. I'm thinking if you move both your head and punch in the same direction you get bigger impacts (though I'm disappointed this is the mechanism for power shots as often the highest generated attacks come when your center line is straight and unwavering). All this said, I'm thoroughly amused! Heck of a workout!\n\nEdit: \"little notion of landing\" I meant that as my hands, arms, shoulders, etc. Are not letting me know I connected. But the game makes it solidly clear.\n\nResponse Reply: Cool to hear from the developer! The opponents ARE quite responsive when you land that perfect shot into the weak areas. I noticed sometimes subtle or not reactions and sounds that would be produced and because of it they immediately triggered my \"kill\" senses lol. I hear you on the mass problem. As a nod is cool enough. Anyhow, hats off to you and your team (if any)! I'm thoroughly impressed and am enjoying your game very much. Thank you for the content and low pricing though I'd buy it again for twice the ask.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseApr 24 at 8:08 AM\n\nThanks for the review! I think that for you as a boxer, looking at the game like shadowboxing against a visual target is the right approach, and I'm glad you're enjoying it. I just wanted to mention that 1) I didn't design the game around requiring people to need to throw as hard as they can and 2) the AI is much easier to hit than what you likely expect from a real opponent, so the damage system focuses more on hitting weak areas on the opponent instead of just hitting hard and often, and the weak areas are harder to hit than they would be in real life (which slightly helps make up for the AI being easier to hit). This is likely why your 20 hit combos don't seem to hurt the opponent as much as you feel like they should compared to real life. Also, the game adjusts based on your strength by default, and if you feel it's making you too weak, you can go into the Settings menu, turn off \"Automatic Force Adjustment\", and use the multipliers to adjust your strength however you want - but be warned that \"1x\" doesn't mean \"real-world\" or anything like that, so put the sliders where they feel best and not just at 1x. There is a little bit of a power bonus for lunges or extreme body rotation, but it's more there as a nod to players that are looking for something like that, and I've intentionally kept it's effect very minor just because I don't have a good way to read out how much body mass you're actually transferring into your swings. The real reason the AI feels stronger than you is because they throw fewer, harder punches aimed at your weak areas, but on Normal (and apart from Duke and Moneymaker) they can't hit any harder than you can and the lean/rotation bonus doesn't really factor into it.", "Bluenaznaz24 days ago\nIts better than any other boxing game\n\nIm a former college boxer. Im totally amazed with this game.\n\nWhen I first got the VR set. I played the other boxing game (Creed). It was unrealistic and boring. Then, I stopped playing at all.\n\nJust recently, I discovered this game! Its realistic and exciting. You can really work on your jabs, foot work, and agility. This game became my workout routine. Sparing rounds over rounds and improving your skills are amazing.\n\nThe game have detailed settings and meaningful customizations.

Both my arms were sore after playing this for the first time and I immediately realized that that meant I was punching incorrectly, I started to play the game even more and practiced different punches and got used to the flow of boxing. After about a week I learned how to punch to minimize the soreness of my arms. After I learned that, this game got ten times better due to the fact that I could carry on full matches without pausing by going into the home menu temporarily. The fighting feels super realistic and I recommend turning off punch effects to really get immersed in the fight. Another pointer is that in case that you just cant do it anymore and get far too tired, just reach your hand over your opponents block and punch them in the side of the head over and over until they get knocked down. And do that until the round ends. I recommend not to do that a lot and only when you really cant go on because the game was made to be realistic, if you want a break, just wait out the timer until you get 60 seconds to take a breather. Overall, great game and even better workout. I cant recommend this more during this quarantine especially.\n\nHelpful | 2", "r-i-c-hApr 21 at 10:22 PM\nEasy and fun workout\n\nAny game that lets me workout while playing is gold.

I appreciated the short 2 minute rounds in the beginning, and I was always happy to be able to catch my breath for one full minute.

TotF is \"roomscale\" only and uses your play area as a miniature boxing ring that you're meant to physically move around in, which is why I list a minimum required play area size on the store page. Oculus intends that you only draw your boundaries so that there are no real objects inside for you to hit, and the game expects that you've set your boundaries up as Oculus instructs. On Quest, when a game wants to use the actual play area size, the Quest has to be in a special mode that also disables the functionality of the recenter button. TotF never even knows you try to recenter. It's like this so that there's not a mismatch between the in-game play area and your real world play area. In TotF, you can face a direction of your play area and set it to be the new \"front\" side by holding down the menu button (like the recenter button, but on the other controller) for two seconds.", "AndicusAlfaBravoApr 5 at 11:31 AM\nBest exercise game\n\nI have multiple games, several well known that are for exercising and for me, this one is simply the best.\nIt would be absolutely amazing if one were to have the option to load photos of people.

Even with the mass multiplier all the way up, the opponent can take a hundred+ hits to the head before going down(I'm not exaggerating either.)On the other hand though, you can go down in around 5 quick hits!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 25 at 12:12 PM\n\nThanks for your honest review. I do want to mention that while the game does care about the exact relative strength of your hits, it's designed so that players are not required to have to swing with any specific level of strength in order to play. As part of that, the damage system is focused on landing purposeful, accurate strikes to the opponent's weak areas if you want to take them down. These are intentionally a bit harder to hit than they would be in real life, but that's because AI is much easier to hit than a real human would be. On Normal mode, the AI can't hit any harder than you can (except for Duke and Moneymaker who do hit harder and are harder to hurt), so anything the AI does to you, you can do right back to them if you're aiming for those weak points and really picking your punches and following up properly. Endurance and Outclassed modes are special challenge modes that intentionally make it very hard to hurt the opponent though (which is why they're named the way they are) so avoid those modes unless you specifically want to have to work yourself like crazy to win. Cranking the multiplier all the way up should still lead to extremely easy knockdowns on Normal from combos, but it has a limit to how hard it can make your hardest hits land for, so just doing that alone won't make you be able to down your opponent in one hit without aiming for the weak areas. If you're looking for that, you'll need to use the Custom menu to reduce their Toughness.", "MrDrMisterMay 17 at 1:11 AM\nFantastic\n\nI knew I was out of shape but this nearly killed me and i loved it.

So immersive!\n\nJokes aside, this game is the best VR boxing simulation on the market as of time of this review. If you are interested in boxing, don't think twice and buy this. The single developer of the game, Ian Fitz, is also awesome. He answers questions/comments people have on his game all over the internet. IMO, he is the example of a game developer to follow. AAA game studios, watch and learn. This is how its done.\n\nGame mechanics:\nYou can throw all types of punches and the game registers what type of punch you did: cross, jab, hook, uppercut. The faster you throw your fists at the opponent, the more damage you do to the opponent. The game also rewards accurate punches with more damage on some of the critical areas of the body. To learn where those areas are, you can train with the dummy. The game auto-adjusts to your own speed by using a force multiplier, so you don't need to be an expert boxer to enjoy the game. After a round of fighting, the next round will be adjusted to your max speed. To knock an opponent, you need to chain multiple strong hits in a short period of time. Those strong hits display a yellow or red marquer on the opponent where you hit them. Blue markers show a weak hit. There is also a notion of cumulative damage, which enable you to knock opponents easier in the later rounds (kind of emulating that the opponent is tired). There is no stamina mechanic like in Creed. The stamina of your fighter is your stamina. If you are tired and can't punch anymore, that's when you will lose. You need to learn to pace yourself and be precise with your punches.\n\nIf you want to get back in shape, or just have a tremendous amount of fun while shadow boxing, buy this now!

I would just be tiring myself out with every punch I throw!\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMay 30 at 8:31 AM\n\nThanks for your honest review. I have a few tips that might help. First, while knockdowns play a very big role, they're not the primary goal, and it's important that you don't focus on trying too hard to down the opponent at the expense of everything else. As you mentioned, you are physically tiring yourself with each punch you throw, so you want to make sure you're landing effective punches to make the most of the real-world energy you're expending. You and the opponent don't have health bars that you're chipping away at with each punch. Instead, each punch is looked at for the effectiveness it had, and you and the opponent are both able to shrug off less effective punches with little permanent effect. This means that you really need to be purposeful with the punches you're throwing and making sure they're solidly landing to locations that will cause pain or injury to your opponent. These strike zones are marked on the boxing dummy, and you can see how well you're hitting them by looking at the \"Weak Point Bonus\" stat on the info panel. Note that they are directional, most of them need to be hit from the side, and the side of the chin is an especially effective target. They're also very hard to hit and take a bit of practice to master, but you're not expected to be nailing them with every swing you throw. Just swing in that general area whenever you can, and you'll occasionally make good connections. The colored splash when you land a hit roughly conveys how effective your punches are. The splashes blend from blue to yellow to red. Solid blue hits don't do much at all and solid red hits are very devastating. When you do land a good hit, you'll hear the opponent grunt and their face will look a bit stunned. When that happens, you'll want to quickly try to follow up with more swings to secure a knockdown. Don't panic, because you still need to be landing high quality shots, and if you get too focused on downing the opponent, it's easy to not realize they've recovered and are back in fighting shape. While you're trying to do all this to the opponent, they're trying to do the same to you, so keep your guard up (don't try to block on reaction) and try to be evasive. Make sure to move around your playspace if you can, and take advantage of staying out of range when you need to. Finally, the game does care about how hard you're swinging, but you don't need to swing very hard to play the game - in fact, swinging as hard as you possibly can just doesn't work very well. The game adjusts your range of strength based on how hard it think you can hit (that's what the multiplier is), so just try to swing comfortably. If you you find you're swinging harder sometimes during a fight and the game is adjusting to it when you don't want it to, you can go to the bottom of the Settings menu, turn off the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" feature, and manually adjust your multiplier. Before you do that, I'd suggest playing a full match against the sparring partner while swinging comfortably, so that your multiplier is adjusted to a comfortable number by default when you turn the automatic adjustment off.", "paul.horton.568Apr 21 at 5:36 AM\nFantastic!\n\nBrilliant workout and tremendous fun!

So much fun for two monthes. Definitely recommend, and would buy it again. But started to feel lack of variety of opponents tactics. It would be nice to also turn it a bit into drilling machine: to have more predefined modes selection, with opponents in different styles, saving my custom configurations into some named config sets. Plus some additional modes - if you want to drill for e.g. some specific stuff: accent on your head movements, or hook counters, or deffensive foot work in case of really aggressive opponent. So would be much more fun if I could choose what exactly i want to train my reaction against. Also would be nice if it was possible to have that additional equipment on center of playground, because currently bag is close to my oculus playground boundaries(does it depend on playground size?). Or to have virtual buddy with pads teaching some simple tactics, like defences after punches, if that is not too complicated to code. I understand that this may be subject for a separate game, but i would gladly pay for such additional content. And for sure it will never be as good as real training, but if ppl have 15 minutes of spare time in evening, why not allow them to spent this time in a more controlled way?

I updated my review to 5 stars because this wound up being a satisfying venture overall, and I'm going to tackle harder modes now.\n\nI still believe the game could benefit from some coaching/tutorials, but I'd give this 4.5/5 because it really is a lot of fun.\n\n\nOriginal review:\n\nReally good boxing game. I enjoy getting a workout, while realistically fighting. I appreciate the various training things you can do, but it would be nice is there was some coaching or minigames attached to them.\n\nThere's no stamina bar, which is nice, so you have to look at your opponent for visual cues on how weary he is. However, I can't tell how close I am to getting knocked down.\n\nThis is where a minigame might be nice, because it says \"you automatically\" get up, but that's flawed to me. I knocked a guy down 3 times, and he gets up; he knocks me down once and I'm out! I felt jipped. Most boxing games have a minigame so you have control getting back to your feet. Might be a nice addition.\n\nFree roaming the gym would be nice too, but the knockdown mechanic is mostly where the one star is lost. I feel less in control of the outcome of the match.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMar 1 at 9:39 AM\n\nThanks for your review! You and the opponent don't have any sort of \"health bar\" mechanic that determines whether you get knocked down or not, so in general there's really no direct concept of how close you are to being knocked down. Instead, each punch landed is looked at individually to see what effect it had. You and the AI score knockdowns by either landing a single devastating punch that's enough to floor the opponent or by rocking the opponent with a hard hit and stumbling them with hard follow-ups. The more damaging the hit was that put the opponent on the floor, the longer the opponent will stay down. Wearing the opponent down with non-knockdown hits will also make it easier to hurt the opponent with your future hits (by a very small amount that's only becomes noticeable towards the end of the fight) and will keep them on the floor longer when they get knocked down. Knockdowns from rocking and stumbling aren't likely to keep an opponent down for the count even if you have worn them down, and you really need to nail one of the weak areas (marked on the dummy) to stand much of a chance at a one-hit knockdown that keeps the opponent down for long. You get an increasing permanent vignette effect on your screen that shows how \"worn down\" you are, but if you're not taking a lot of hits you might not ever notice it. Generally you'll be taken down by good hits that nail one of your weak areas or by hard hits that noticeably rock you first (grayscale screen effect) before you drop to a follow-up. If the AI is able to put you down for the count, it's because they nailed you with an absolutely perfect shot, and that should be extremely rare on Normal mode (which is the \"balanced\" mode). The other modes increase the AI's punching power and lets them drop you more easily with single hits (in addition to letting them shrug off your hits better and boosting other stats) and are intentionally meant to feel one-sided. Duke and Moneymaker also hit a little harder (and can shrug off hits better) than the rest of the roster, so it's easier for them to do, too.", "billylewis7Mar 15 at 5:38 AM\nGreat!\n\nJust bought the Quest and this was one of the first games I bought due to the ratings and even though my body is sore (shouldve started on easy) I can say that I can see endless hours of enjoyment on here. Worth the money!\n\nHelpful | 1", "pj656Apr 17 at 3:40 PM\nIts hit and miss but cheap\n\nOkay second time writing this review. Honestly this game led to me punching my wall earlier because I could not recentre the game as my opponent was constantly running out of my guardian and into my wall wall and I could do nothing about it. My play area is roughly 3mx1.8m, and the game forces me to play facing the shorter of the 2 lengths. I believe it would've still happened with a fuller 2x2 area.\n\nThat being said the game is a good workout for 6 when I bought it. Gameplay is very good and certainly gets you sweating, would be nice to get more opponents for flavour but the game has a decent replay value with a lot of flexibility in choosing opponent settings. Sometimes I have tracking issues playing the game but I suppose that's more the quests fault.\n\nBut not having the ability to readjust is just a massive mistake in my opinion. I know I could enjoy this game without worrying about my boundaries if I could play it facing the length of my room, but it feels so restricting not having this choice.\n\nAt the end of the day it's not bad,but it would be genuinely one of the better quest games regardless of price if ityou could use the recentring feature\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 17 at 4:26 PM\n\nThanks so much for reconsidering your review. You've shared some valuable info in this post, and I think I can help get things working well for you. First, though, please absolutely make sure the boundaries you've drawn only include areas you're willing to move and punch within and that you don't have them right up against the edge of a wall or other obstacle. It doesn't have to be a huge gap, but you do want to leave a little margin of error in case the Quest didn't put the boundary exactly where you thought you drew it. If you're in roomscale mode and your boundaries are clear, you should be all set as far as the opponent staying within your free space. The game itself is actually designed around 2m by 1.5m of space as a minimum (up to 4m by 4m maximum), but I list 2m by 2m on the Quest because that's what Oculus lists as their minimum roomscale size on Quest. The way the Quest picks its \"forward\" direction is a little mysterious to me, but I have a couple of ways in the game that you can change it. First, if you want to pick a completely new forward direction for the game to use, hold down the menu button for a couple of seconds - i.e., the button that's like the normal recenter button, but on the other controller. I use that one because the Quest handles recenter requests itself instead of passing the request on to the game, and it doesn't do anything for games that are in roomscale mode (the Rift lets the game handle the recenter request even when in roomscale mode, and that version of TotF uses the normal recenter button to pick a new forward direction, as you'd expect). Doing this will take whatever edge of your play area (the red rectangle on the floor) that you're looking at and make it the new \"front\" side. The next thing you can do is go into the in-game Settings menu and change the \"In-Match Turn Direction\" setting. That makes your forward direction different when you're in a match compared to when you're not in one. You can use that to, for example, make the menu screen be 3m side-to-side while having the matches be 3m front-to-back, which is probably what I'd recommend for the shape of the play area you have. Please feel free to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com, and I'll be happy to help if you have any questions about getting these configured.

I just wanted to respond and let you know that you do have arms, but they are invisible. The game doesn't know where your arms are in real life, but your forearms come straight out from your gloves as if your wrists are tightly wrapped, and then your upper arms go from your elbow to where the game thinks your shoulders might be (which isn't especially accurate). It's very easy to bend your wrist a little on accident and send your forearms somewhere you're not expecting, but knowing it works this way may help a little bit. I'm trying to get a sequel project started with multiplayer, so watch out for that someday. There still will be no stamina gauge, but \"button mashing\" shouldn't be an issue for the same reason it wouldn't be in real life.", "quanster76Feb 11 at 6:31 AM\nMuch better than expected!\n\nSo before I bought this game the videos didnt encourage me to buy it.

He aint no sucka in the ring, he knows the mitts but he holds guard too long. Work joes ribs till he lowers his guard more and more, while protecting yourself and... now we have a new local hero.

I won't leave just another rave review because all the great things about TOTF have already been done to death.\n\nFirstly, I wish that there was more leeway to break an opponents lazy guard and to punch through the gaps like in real life. Lomachenko is a great example of using different angles to sneak past the guard. Most common is being able to punch through the triangle formed by their glove on their chin by stepping out on a 45 degree angle. Also the upward jab to sneak through the small gap in their front guard.\n\nThe second thing I would love to see in the next iteration is the ability to fully customize the style of the A.I using actual styles like counterpuncher, defensive, aggressive, slugger, boxer, sloppy guard. Being able to create a realistic opponent who has bad habits and favorite punches.\n\nI definitely can't wait to see what lies ahead for this simulation, no pressure!\n\nHelpful | 2", "landenpompeiiMay 6 at 12:30 PM\nMoney maker removal\n\nI cant beat the money maker guy no matter how many times I hit him\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 9 at 4:53 PM\n\nThanks for the review. Some quick advice: If you're swinging really hard to try to take him down, try swinging less hard. While the relative strength of your swings does matter, the game is more about accurately aiming at the weak areas marked on the boxing dummy. The game adjusts to your strength by default, so if you swing comfortably it will work as expected. If you swing too hard, though, the game will just adjust around that, and it will be harder to keep up with. You can also turn this off (at the bottom of the Settings menu) if you don't want it to automatically adjust. Focus on making every punch count, and if you don't have a good opening then don't try to throw. Remember to move around your play area to keep your distance when needed. Do your best to avoid his swings, and if you land a good hit on him make sure to follow up while aiming for those weak areas. Make sure not to get too focused while you're beating on him, and back off before he recovers. As the champion, he represents the best of every opponent you've fought and is meant to be a significant challenge.", "gorgullMar 5 at 10:40 PM\n\nSo good!\n\nTwo little cons though:\n- the spectators :-o\n- could benefit from boxing lessons\n\nBut for such a price, we cant ask for a lot more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "jornostikosJul 11 at 3:11 PM\nBetter workout than expected.\n\n\n\nHelpful | 0", "TheOrsimer117Jun 24 at 8:01 PM\nThe physics and fighting is remarkable\n\nI'm quite glad I found this game, and was more than willing to purchase it for 10 dollars\n\nHelpful | 0", "Sly_dsApr 4 at 4:35 AM\n\nReminds mme of when I use to spare\n\nHelpful | 0", "KrispyCabbage_Feb 28 at 1:00 PM\nBest fitness game\n\nThis games is probably one of my favourite but it could do with different fight locations more often like maybe the higher you go on the fight part the different the surroundings\n\nHelpful | 0", "Stewboy222Feb 28 at 5:25 PM\nBest workout ever\n\nJust mike many others, I gave the game a try and within minutes I was sweating like crazy.

When you throw a hard punch, it's possible for the spring in the controller's battery compartment to compress and make the battery lose contact. Users have been fixing it by putting small rubber bands around the battery or inserting things into the battery compartment to keep the battery in place. Send me an email at fyiandev@gmail.com, and I'll send you some links to posts people have made about the problem and how they fixed it, and I'll help out in whatever other way I can.

It really does tick every box for me in terms of what I want from VR. I find TotF perfectly balanced; immersive, fun and rewarding. It's already been a benefit to my fitness and overall health. It has proven longevity (I purchased last year). TotF also works really well as warm up for real boxing drills and is an asset to anyone looking to hone their skills . A lot of thought has gone into game design, it is easy to pick up and compellingly challenging. It triggers those competitive instincts, making for a fantastic motivated work out where you just want to fight one more round... and then another! You can tailor settings and modify attributes, pushing your proficiency as you start to progress, adding extra rounds and increasing difficulty. In my opinion TotF also fits perfectly with the capabilities of the Quest, being untethered in a boxing ring while playing this is an absolute buzz. Another huge plus is that the developer (Ian) is truly passionate and dedicated to his user base and appreciates feedback, going out of his way to obtain information that Im sure will help create even more special titles. Its amazing that this near-perfect game is the work of one guy. It reminds me of the old, old days (Adrian Stephens on the Beeb yes Im old). I really look forward to the next iteration but dont see myself ever tiring of this rock-solid boxing simulation. If you want to get trim and shed some weight in 2020, get this!

When I got a VR headset boxing was high on my list hoping there would be a good game out there.

Now my review-Good things: The fighters look great and they show damage, such as a bloody nose when you hit them. You have to move around and bob/ weave or you will lose. This, along with blocking and punching from all different angles makes for a great workout. You will sweat and end up talking about your fight! Areas that could be improved: The spectators look like zombies and your corner-man doesn't give any advice. It should allow Player vs Player and have an online match making and ranking system. A couple of commentators would be great! Maybe add a new fighter every week for download to keep it interesting.\nOverall, this is one of the best games that I have ever played!

I'm glad you're enjoying TotF! I did want to mention that the game orients in the direction that your Quest tells it is the \"front\" direction, and unfortunately there's not an easy way to tell the Quest to pick a new front direction without running through Guardian setup again (and even then, it's not exactly clear how the Quest is choosing the front direction). The option in the Settings menu wasn't added to fix this issue, which is why the wording isn't straightforward for this context. Ideally holding the recenter button on the controller would pick a new front direction (which is what happens on the Rift version), but for some reason the Quest doesn't notify room scale games that the user tried to recenter. I've asked Oculus to allow this, but in the meantime I plan to release an update that lets players hold a different button to reorient.", "Nix0327Jan 7 at 1:39 PM\nGreat boxing sim. Patience is key.\n\nLove the fact this game is based on hit accuracy foremost to succeed in this game. Really doesn't matter on the strength of your punch, but helps when you do score on a weak point area on the opponents. Tip practice on the training dummy before you fight. Learn the weak points. Overall if you are looking for something other than Creed, which I own, this is a real experience. Also you can play this game even if you don't have 6.5ftx6.5 feet. Your play area you've drawn out will be the play space in the ring. A red grid of the place space is drawn in game on the canvas of the ring,and the guardian grid will pop up normally, just stay within your play space. Just give yourself some room to move a little bit, more so infront of you and behind you, and a little for some side movement. I play in a rectangular play space 4ftx6.5 and it has been fine. Now buy this game, good price, great workout!\n\nHelpful | 4", "Erick2218Feb 9 at 7:03 PM\nThrill of the fight\n\nI have tried a couple boxing games on the oculus now. This game rocks.

It offers a great simulation of a boxing match and I find the fights to indeed be thrilling. However, they can become frustrating due to lack of guided training or instruction. There is a menu card on the main screen that gives some tips, but not much else. You have to figure things out on your own and train yourself.\n\nThe game whats you to focus on timing and hitting specific points of impact to maximize the effect of your punches, like in real boxing, but never really gives you instruction on how to do that or feedback of how you may be doing it right or wrong.\n\nThe most you get is a training dummy with the correct impact points that you can train on and a window to the side that displays hit data but you kinda have to figure it out on your own. To be fair, there may have been a brief explanation window when you first play explaining this concept, but I can't find a way to bring it back and reread it. They are also heavy bag, speed bag, and focus ball training modes but unless you already know how to use them your not going to get any help from the game.\n\nAlso there is a man that stands behind you while training, or ringside when fighting, silently watching and judging but offering little else. I think he is either meant to be your trainer or a perv that just likes to hang out at the local gym watching people. You can punch him though, so thats something.\n\nIn the end I would recommend the game for the exercise and the challenge of the fights, as its not too expensive and fun, but don't look to the game to help you improve in your bouts. You'll have to look elsewhere for instruction.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 4 at 8:29 AM\n\nThanks for your honest review. This is all very fair criticism that I completely agree with. I'm the sole dev of TotF and most of my development time was spent on the fighting mechanics. The goal was to make it so real life boxing approaches and technique would work in the game, and so while I wasn't able to add in-game guided boxing training, you can use real-world boxing tutorial videos and apply what you learn to TotF. I've tried to price the game appropriately to the level of content and polish that I was able to provide.", "m4dd0g.ARQEFeb 27 at 7:05 PM\nGood workout !\n\nGreat to speed up the heart rate and have fun doing it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "NyxnnJan 9 at 4:45 PM\nBy far the best quest workout game\n\nIm pretty fit and about average weight and this game makes me sweat.

You're not only meant to dodge the ghost's punches, but you're also meant to swing back, too. It's a full fight like the normal ones, but with the gimmick that you can only hit the ghost while he's swinging at you. Think of it as if when you can't hit him, he can't hit you, but when he materializes in order to hurt you, you have the opportunity to hurt him, too. In any fight, you can clinch the opponent for 5 seconds straight to end the match early.

Combining the stats on the training dummy and the match stats and making it all persistent would be great for tracking progress.\n\nHelpful | 1", "soxincincyDec 30 at 9:02 PM\n\nReally well made game.

I was addicted after the first couple of fights.\n2. I do a lot of dance style workouts on Beachbody and was looking forward to the dancing games on the Quest. But the workout I've received in this game is different. It is the best workout on the Quest, especially in you want to build stamina. This game has become my go to workout. I did not expect a gaming system to provide a solid workout, but this game delivers.\n3. This game is very affordable, I got it on sale, but it is easily worth more than the list price.\n4. The fighters all appear to have different styles (esp. on the higher difficulty levels), so there is also quite a bit of strategy involved, just like the real thing.\n\nMy wife got me this system because I am an avid gamer. But this program is more of a simulation than a game. The graphics do not have the 'wow' factor of my other games. But this program's simplicity is functional and simply beautiful. I will never experience the inside of a real boxing ring, and thankfully never experience the pain or blood involved. But the intensity of this experience to me, is what VR can be all about.

So far when players have reached out to me about this problem and we look into it together, what has been happening is that their fist has been passing behind the opponent's head. There's some sort of predictive behavior or something like that with Oculus's tracking system that causes fast hooks to drift outward. The faster your hook, the farther out the tracking drifts, as if your arm is longer than it should be. This can result in you being able to hit the opponent from farther away than you should be able to, and it can cause your fist to reach past the back of their head causing you to miss. The best way to address this is to punch a little slower. Boxing style hooks thrown by pros are in the 14m/s range, so if you're seeing much higher speeds than that on the heavy bag then try throwing your hook more by rotating your body with a locked arm and less by planting your body and whipping your arm. There's also an in-game setting that can help prevent the behind-the-head drift issue (called \"Drift Protection\"), but if you turn that on then you absolutely need to be sure that your floor height is calibrated correctly, as the setting limits the distance away from you the glove can go based on your height.", "vagueone007Dec 26 at 6:43 AM\nRealistic / Great workout\n\nI liked this better than Creed, its a better boxing simulator.

When I throw a right jab...hard...my boxing glove literally flies off into the ring ( my controller stays in hand) is this part of the game play? i.e my punch was so badly timed my glove falls off? And thirdly... Coming from creed 2, although I like the ruggedness of the game, a little more crowd variation ... Animation differences wouldn't hurt, seeing different characters clearly doing the same motion in the background... I think I'd prefer an empty gym. On the plus side tho... You have to really punch hard to get these guys...it's an excellent warm up to any home excersise routine.\n\nHelpful | 27\nDeveloper ResponseOct 25 at 11:16 AM\n\nThanks for your review. 1) This is a limitation of the Quest system software when a game is in \"stage\" mode like TotF is. The game is never notified that the user tried to change their view. I let Oculus know about this, so hopefully it's something that gets updated in the future (and my code for handling this from the PC version is still there, so it should suddenly just work in TotF again if Oculus fixes it). 2) There's a known issue with the Touch controllers where throwing hard punches can cause the spring to compress in the battery compartment, which makes the battery lose contact for a fraction of a second, which causes tracking issues like you're describing. Users have fixed it by inserting a conductive shim to wedge the battery in place, putting sticky shelf liner in the battery compartment to stop the battery from moving, or by adding a tighter spring to the battery compartment. 3) It's just me working on the game, so the kinda lame audience members are the best I was able to do. It was even worse in past versions!

However this game really surprised me, the hand collision for s start is very good allowing you to defend peak a boo style, duck and weave or go for more of a Mayweather style slip and counter. Ive only got a small space so fights are all on the inside but imagine with more space you can start to use range as well. I started out just throwing some different punches to see how the opponent reacted and then decided to throw a signature left hook...boom the opponent goes down and I thought, how did the computer know I threw proper technique with that one, later when I discovered the heavy bag I realised it was monitoring the punch power and quickly realised to be good at this game is going to require actual skill. Instantly I was more invested and started fighting as I would in real life, holding back some energy for those big ko punches later on. Finally I have never sweated so much playing quest, the only downside being I had to keep stopping to clean the lens. Reason its not 5 stars for me is there isnt much of a story, would like to see a bit more emphasis on working through the ranks and becoming champion selecting who you want to fight and which belts you want to fight for.

This make the game completely unplayable for me.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 26 at 7:21 AM\n\nAs mentioned in the game's description, you MUST have 6.5ft by 6.5ft (2m by 2m) of real-world space to play in, and your Guardian boundaries must be set up in room scale mode around this free space. Your Guardian boundaries should not be drawn anywhere you can't move and punch into. This requirement is because you're expected to physically move around your play area like it's a miniature boxing ring, and there is no joystick movement. The game uses a special mode on Quest called \"stage mode\" that allows the game to map to your Guardian boundary play area size. When a game on Quest is in \"stage mode\", the Quest's recenter button stops doing anything and the Quest doesn't notify the game that the user is trying to recenter, so TotF doesn't know and can't know you're holding the recenter button. Even if it was able to, since the game is mapped to your play area size and location, the game still wouldn't shift to recenter around you because that would make the in-game play area no longer line up properly with your real-world play area. On Rift, I do respond to the recenter button by changing the side of your play area that you're facing to be the new front side. On Quest, I've had to move that functionality to holding down the menu button on the other controller, since I can't detect when players are trying to recenter. TotF was tweaked specifically for Quest, and then those changes were actually ported back to the other platforms that the game is on.", "NRGFormaLDec 24 at 8:49 AM\nAmazing!\n\nI absolutely love this game.

The game just wasn't built with multiplayer in mind, and adding it would require a major rewrite of how large portions of the game work.

And that's what I got. After my first day of playing it I was left sore and sweating. I now try to do a match at the end of my workouts to take up the remaining energy I have. I find myself swinging as hard as I can. Sometimes the tracking doesn't work and it's a shame but the majority of the time it sees my lightning fast punch and boom. I find it really fun to be able to for example hit my apponets in the gut and they drop their hands down as they crunch over and you can land a heavy punch to the dome. I think my only complaints about this game is each opponent seems to react and fight very similarly and so it doesn't really get more challenging to figure out their particular weaknesses. And I wish there was a social aspect of the game. Either fighting our friends or comparing scores on fights, maybe comparing punches or something. It's hard to talk to your friend about knocking this virtual dude out when he can say yep I did the same. It would be even cooler if there was part of the game where you could stand ringside and watch your friend fight a virtual opponent. You can cheer them on or cheer against them, *bet* on the fight and so on. Could invite a couple people in to watch. And then once that fight is done. Now it's your turn to fight and his turn to watch. Please make this a thing.

The red rectangle on the floor is what the Quest system software says is your \"play area\". I believe it's calculated as the largest rectangle that will fit inside your boundaries, but you don't have any more specific control over the size or shape of it than that. TotF is \"room scale\" only and the fighting always takes place within that play area reported by the Quest. If you want to change your play area, you'll need to redraw your boundaries. Recentering doesn't do anything because there's no point of reference to center by in room scale mode (and in fact, when a game is in room scale mode on the Quest - they call it \"stage\" mode - the recenter request isn't even passed to the game by the Quest system software).", "garye333Jan 27 at 8:59 PM\nAwesome\n\nThe Best game for exercise\n\nHelpful | 0", "ChasingNostalgiaDec 28 at 8:56 PM\nHeart Pumping\n\nI was sore for two days after buying this game.

However with careful initial placement and knowing where my furniture is I can just get by!! The game is very good value being one of the cheaper options for the Quest. You have to walk to the scales to start and then to the menu screen (there is no option to teleport) you can then train on the various items of equipment or go into a fight. You can choose your opponent and select a difficulty level. You then have to go to your corner to start the bout. Your opponent then appears in front of you ready to fight. The early matches consist of 3, 2 minute rounds each separated by a corner break. You can either wait out the whole time or choose to get back in the action. I must admit to needing a break as the boxing is quite intense!! At the end of the match the judges give their scores and the referee declares the winner. You are also given the option to view various stats about how you performed!! This is a good companion to games like Box VR giving you more of a feel for real boxing and you can see your opponent taking damage as the match progresses.

It also serves as a great workout, the first time playing I was actually soar.

Ive done a little stand-up MMA and I feel like this game does a great job simulating boxing. Short of a haptic device which comes out which hits you in the nose, this is probably as real as its going to get, at least until a new generation of hardware comes out in a few years. Great damage modeling, and a fun experience. I also have Creed, and although its a great game, I feel like Thrill of the Fight feels more realistic and gives a more enjoyable workout. If you want to feel like youre in a movie, get Creed; but if you want to feel like youre standing in a boxing ring boxing someone, get Thrill of the Fight. It has a slick interface and feels polished, although theres not a ton of bling. Its more about the simulation than the storyline. To me, this is a good thing, although some may prefer Creed if they care less about the simulation and more about the bells and whistles of a story. TotF still offers a workout on the bags, but it doesnt obnoxiously force it upon you for pointless thirty-second sessions, like the competition does.

Even on easy, you will feel like you need to clean your headset after each match. The game gives you a handful of fighters and three different locations to fight. You can progress through them linearly and adjust the difficulty along with custom options. It also gives you some training modes like the heavy bag and speed bag.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out for me is how visceral it feels. Landing punches and swinging your arms feels so accurate and dodging and looking for an opening gets intense. You'll push yourself a lot just trying to get a knockdown and make no mistake that's a hard thing to do. It feels like an actual fight, not some arcadey fight where you know you're going to win.

I also recommend that you stick to Normal mode, as Endurance and Outclassed are specifically meant to make your hits feel less effective to force you to work harder (which is why it's called \"Endurance\" and not \"Hard\").", "hmallar1Dec 24 at 6:28 PM\nSweatfest\n\nI easily burn 200-400 Calories every time I start this app. The physics are realistic and it is extremely satisfying.\n\nHelpful | 0", "toastedmikeJan 11 at 7:26 AM\n\nSimple and works, love it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "dex.edwardsNov 26 at 5:02 PM\nGreat workout and very immersive\n\nI bought the Quest hoping to merge my enjoyment of video gaming with my recent adoption of fitness and exercise.

The hand tracking is impeccable; I just finished a one-minute sparring match and I'm still catching my wind about 10 minutes later (hey, throwing 50+ punches in a minute is exhausting!). The modeling is wonderful. I can walk right up to the referee and look at him from an inch or so away, and he looks like a real person (mostly) -- he even reacts with a curling of his lip when I raise my glove near him! I think that this game is amazing, and that it is an effective and fun boxing simulator, as well as an incredible aerobic workout.\n\nAgain, everything in the game is controlled by your hands and how fast you can move them. Your opponent drops his guard for a second to throw a punch, and you have that long to punch him in his gob. Or goolies. (I'm not really British, but you get my point.) If you're looking for a holodeck where you can punch another person, this is it. I play this in the middle of the day, and it really helps to get me \"out of my own head.\"\n\nThanks, devs!

I loaded up again today and didnt have the glove fly off, I am right handed. I have a suspicion maybe my ceiling fan was affecting tracking. I must say tho, its very disorienting when the glove flys off into the distance, it would be good if the tracking loss was more constrained. The quest has gotten better with hands in front of the headset but I guess the glare is still a problem sometimes.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseDec 26 at 7:13 AM\n\nHey, I'd like to help out with this if possible. I've had a few reports of people saying their right hand is flying off, but so far all of those people have been right-handed and have kept their right hand in the rear and put their left hand out as their lead hand. Do you happen to be left handed and are keeping your left hand in back? If so, what might be happening is that the Quest cameras may be losing track of your rear hand when you're guarding. Another issue that's been reported is that very fast punches that comes to a sudden stop (like a lightning fast jab or cross) can cause the spring in the battery terminal to compress, causing the battery to lose contact with the other terminal and blinking off power to the controller for a moment. This usually results in the controller either freezing in air where the power dropped out or flying off in the direction the punch was headed until it reconnects. Users have fixed this before by inserting a conductive shim to wedge the battery in tighter, replacing the battery spring with a stiffer one, or lining the battery compartment with sticky shelf liner to hold the battery in place. I've also heard some people say that fast, wide, looping hooks will cause a tracking issue as well. I'm not sure exactly what it is about that style of punch that's causing the issue, but I think it may be that a really wide swing will cause the controller to spend too much time out of the sight of the tracking cameras while you're \"loading up\" and then the high force of the swing causes the controller to fly off in a direction before the cameras can reacquire tracking. You can go to the in-game Settings menu and turn on the controller outline option if you want to verify this is a tracking issue. Those controller outlines are positioned directly by the tracking issue, so if they're displaying a problem then it's a problem with where the Quest thinks the controllers are. If there's any way I could help further or if you want to discuss, please email me at fyiandev@gmail.com. Hopefully this info helps. Thanks!", "loregnumNov 27 at 12:46 PM\nI love it but...\n\nI really do like this game as it is one of my favourites but getting true knockouts is beyond ridiculous. I only won by TKO or scorecard in all the regular matches so I set up some custom ones with 10 knockdown TKO rules and 10 round fights with the opponent at default health. On the first fight (Ugly Joe) I knocked him down 44 times before finally getting a true knockout on the 45th in the 9th round. Yes, 44 before the final one. Next fight (possibly Joe or the first fighter before him) it took 31 before the 10 count one. In the third fight, I just gave up after I got to probably 20+ with most of them (probably 90%) being red damage uppercuts to the chin. I also adjusted my mass multiplier in that third fight to be higher to see if it would change this. Nope! The whole mass multiplier thing seems glitchy/broken as well.\n\nTo go with that, on so many of those red hit uppercuts, the opponent was flying back and looked like he was dead yet started to get up as the ref reached 1 or 2 in the count! What the heck is that? Again, red damage punches which are supposed to be the best and it's not like this was only on the first or second knockdown. We're talking the same crap after 15+.\n\nFor a game that is supposed to give a real world experience, this is not real world. No boxer would be getting up on 1 or 2 counts with clean uppercuts to the chin after being knocked down 20+ times in 3-4 rounds. No boxer would be getting up at all.\n\nThis really needs to be fixed. I don't even think Mike Tyson would get true knockouts in this game until he's at 30+ knockdowns. I shouldn't have to adjust the chin/health of the opponent lower than default either to fix this though I doubt it would even matter.\n\nHelpful | 9", "caublasianNov 11 at 4:49 PM\nBest boxing game I've played on here.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to get into a ring and punch the he** out of someone without being knocked out then get this game haha.

These modes didn't originally exist in TotF. The default fights worked like they do now on Normal, and players were meant to use the Customize menu to tailor they fights however they wanted. I got a lot of feedback requesting presets for \"challenge\" modes, so I added the Endurance and Outclassed modes.

I try to emphasize this in my store description. The second paragraph (of two total) is dedicated to describing how much completely empty free space is required to play. Unlike most other games, TotF is a true \"room scale\" game, and games in \"room scale\" mode on Quest (called \"stage mode\") aren't notified in any way when the player uses the reset position function. All of the fighting action takes place within your play area (which is automatically calculated by the Oculus software as the largest rectangle that fits within your boundaries), and you're expected to physically move around within that space. In that concept, recentering wouldn't do anything because it wouldn't change where your play area is within the real world. Again, I don't try to hide this at all, and it's right there in my store description that you need 6.5ft by 6.5ft (2m by 2m) of free space.", "cyclohexeneFeb 1 at 12:02 PM\nBrutal cardio workout\n\nAwesome workout for your arms and great cardio.

You can wear them down over time to make them easier to knock down, but they don't have a hidden health bar that you're chipping away at with each punch until they fall down or anything like that. Instead, each punch you land is looked at to see what effect it had on the opponent. You can get a knockout with your first punch if you land your best swing perfectly to the side of their chin or you could land a million light hits in a round and not affect the opponent at all. Make sure that if you get a yellow or red hit, hear them grunt, and see them with a dazed look on their face that you try to follow up to secure a knockdown before they recover (but don't overexpose or overtire yourself in the process if it's just not happening). Their dizzy/confused face is the same thing as when you get the black-and-white screen effect after you take a hard hit. Also, if you feel like you should be hitting harder than the game is allowing you to, then you might want to go to the very last option in the in-game Settings menu, turn off \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" and (slowly) increase the sliders until your punch strength feels like what you want it to.

The presentation is clean and no frills and you can be sparring in 30 seconds after you open the game but I highly recommend at least spending some time hitting the practice dummy to learn the opponent's weak spots . This will help immensely in the fights . Each opponent has a different style and looking for openings and counterpunching after dodging or blocking is much more effective than swinging wildly . This is what makes the game so great - only clean punches do damage to your opponent and your own endurance is not artificially limited . To that point, you will find yourself improving very quickly as your punching accuracy, timing and real life stamina improve . I have never had more fun getting a workout and the manual adjustments on all variables of your opponents allows you to tinker until you create the Frazier to your Ali.

Fighting rounds is a fantastic workout, expect your heart-rate to go through the roof and lose those kilos working out. I really like how they use the 2x2m playspace, it's the first game where I actually feel I am walking around and using the space to move around the fighters. I would class this as a boxing simulator, and would not be surprised it genuinely improves your skills. The opponent behavior feels super realistic, down to restraint, expression and heavy breathing, I have experienced genuine thrills from outsmarting my opponent and knocking them out, judging subtle cues such as breath, stance and expression. I can't wait to jump back in. So far I have Beat Saber and Creed, both will have me coming back for a long time, but there is something about this title that hits a level of realism other titles have not yet achieved. Much respect to the team. The price at 14.99 was perfect for me, between box vr and this made the decision easy, especially as the screenshots were graphically not enticing, yet did give me the impression this was a purist title. I would love to have a training or feedback mode that focuses on blocking and technique, especially since there is the ability to adapt bad technique in VR.

Now that said, Ive only played this for a couple rounds and I wonder if your character has to be upgraded? The game seems to judge speed and accuracy well, but it doesnt seem to measure follow-through. I feel like Im hitting a lot harder than its showing and the first fight it seems impossible to drop him and Im constantly punching a bit past his temple and jaw with minimal reaction? Is it due to the players character being low level? **Update** Actually nevermind I found the auto adjust damage setting and turned it off. With the 1:1 ratio I can drop the first guy easily but the harder guys later move faster and more unpredictable which is exactly as expected! This is seriously a fantastic boxing sim- Im playing with my shirt off now and find Im taking the full minute breaks between rounds.\n\nAnyways, still a really fun game and most accurate boxing experience so far.

But more than that it's just so well balanced. You dont need to be a boxer to play it, but you'll definitely need to put the effort in and improve your sense of timing, speed and power. The fights are tough but fair and sense of achievement when winning a hard match or scoring a knockdown is amazing. I have just under the recommended play area but have had no problems as the pace of the fight is not frantic. This a well considered fight simulator and you need to pick your shots and always consider your defense. Lastly, for the money being asked it's an absolute steal.

Sorry I said that hate me now. Compared to all the 5 star reviews you'll probably disregard this one are you probably should. But uh this game to me at least is super dull and boring. Ouch right. The graphics are just bad and the fights are terrible. Your opponent litterlty stands their and swings at you every couple seconds and that's it. You can hit him super fast or slow doesn't seem to matter. Nothing changed theirs no life bars or indercaters as far as I can tell. Eventually he just kinda slumps over. The characters themselves are dull and not well animated. The rooms are also just boring Nothing happening at all. You just stand their swinging like mad at your opponent hoping that your doing some sort of damage. I rated 3 stars because apparently people love this game so I'm probably a small minority. I get its supposed to be realistic or something but it just seems dull. I've literally played 4 rounds total and I just can't seem to find any reason to play it. Now I'm coming with this perspective after playing creed so I get that this is an old port and is met to be old school. But honestly if I was alound to refund I would because I honestly play creed a decent amount. So do I recommend buying it... Sure support the vr community why not. Will I personally ever play this... No never I mean I'm probably just being harsh and I'm sorry for that but it was just a big let down coming from a 4.9 average star perspective.\n\nHelpful | 21\nDeveloper ResponseNov 4 at 6:14 PM\n\nThanks for your review. I appreciate that you still gave 3 stars despite the negative experience you had with it. You're probably a bit confused as to how others are managing to enjoy the game despite the experience you had, and I thought I'd try to provide a little bit of an explanation even if it doesn't change the way you personally feel about the game. TotF is meant to be more of a real-world inspired experience rather than an arcadey action game. There are no life bars because there are no life bars in actual real-world boxing. In fact, mechanically in TotF there's no behind-the-scenes life bar to show even if you wanted to see it because the damage system doesn't work like that. Instead, each hit you land is looked at individually to see how hard it landed, where it hit, and from what direction to determine what effect it had on the opponent. Many hits will just put the opponent on the defensive but won't really hurt them. Some may hurt them and eventually cause them to get worn down, but otherwise won't be much of an immediate threat. Some will dizzy them, which you can see from their reaction to the hit and through their facial expression, and you can attempt to follow up before they recover to secure a knockdown. Some can knock them down outright in a single hit if landed in the right way and to the right place. You're meant to use real boxing punching form, real boxing defense, and move around your real-world play area as if it were a miniature boxing ring as if you were doing virtual interactive shadowboxing. You need to play the part a bit, and you get out of it what you put in. Apparently many people are attracted to that more grounded and real-world inspired form of gameplay, and that's what sets TotF apart from the other boxing games that are available. Despite the boxing theme shared by the games, TotF is really nothing like Creed in the same way that Creed is really nothing like Knockout League. If you go into one of those three games expecting the gameplay from one of the others, you're going to be confused and disappointed. Aside from that, there are other shortcomings in TotF such as the visuals or AI capability, but that's a side effect of it just being me making the game, and I've tried to price the game appropriately for the level of polish and amount of content I was able to provide. If you do ever feel like giving the game another try, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the game or its mechanics if you want to email me at fyiandev@gmail.com.

Thrill of the Fight is a true boxing game. For $10! No gimics, no glitz, no glamor. Just simple straightforward boxing. For $10! You hit the opponents and they hit you unless you're skilled and dodging, weaving and blocking. The physics are pretty good given that you're not hitting something solid - welcome to VR! The pace is nice, certainly in the early rounds, and the stamina is yours, not some artificial computer simulated stamina. This encourages you box clever and hopefully, if you play enough and your fitness level rises, you'll be able to sustain the onslaught and increase speed and power.

If you're losing tracking when you punch as hard as you can, it might be because the force of your punch is causing the spring in the battery compartment to compress, causing the battery to lose contact with the other terminal and quickly cut out the power to your controller. Users that have had this problem have reported a variety of fixes to me, like by inserting a stiffer spring, wedging in a conductive shim, putting sticky shelf liner in the battery compartment, or even just putting a small rubber band around the battery to stop it from moving around as easily. If the tracking seems fine, but the punch isn't have the effect you want, try going to the very bottom of the in-game Settings menu and turning off the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" checkbox, and then using the two sliders that appear to set your level of strength to whatever feels correct to you.

TotF is roomscale only with a minimum supported size of 6.5ft by 6.5ft (2m by 2m). All of the action should take place within the red rectangle on the floor that represents your play area, and that red rectangle should be within your guardian boundaries if you're in \"roomscale\" mode. Although I don't recommend or support it, you can technically play in \"stationary\" mode, but the game will draw a 5ft by 5ft (1.5m by 1.5m) rectangle around whatever center point you had set up before you started the game.

The speedbag is horrible, it behaves as if it is on a track and not a free swinging connection; by that I mean it only goes back and forth but it doesnt go side to side or swing around in a circle. Thats too bad because it is the free and unpredictable motion of a speedbag that makes a speedbag worthwhile. Other than that I got much more of an actual work out than I expected.

The hit detection is wonderful and the subtraction of a stamina bar as well as freedom to dictate how you fight makes this game feel much more immersive than its competitors.\n\nHowever, the game is incredibly easy and has exploitable programming for its AI. While yes I have never been more exhausted after a session of gaming in my life the game only has the illusion of difficulty.\n\nLet me explain what I mean in the paragraph above this one.\n1.The AI doesn't seem to adapt at all. You can quickly just throw a right hook followed by a straight jab and will catch your opponent in a loop that the AI has no idea what to do about. Makes winning fights as easy as stunning the opponent until the time runs out.\nAnd,\n2. The AI also doesn't seem to throw more than a few set kinds of combos making it very simple to just block everything if you do need to take a breath in the middle of a flurry of right hooks and left straights.\n\nThe only other complaints I have are how the game wants me to physically move around my play space but you don't really need to. Why not allow some locomotion with a thumbstick?\nThen there's the fact that you absolutely have to punch extremely hard irl to be able to do any meaningful damage to my opponent if I get tired of winning by points. I'm not a small man. I'm pretty tall and fast. So I have no idea why I have to nearly throw my shoulder out to hit to register a significant blow.\n\nOther than that this is a great game and an absolute steal for $9.99. Not perfect by any means but still a great game.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper ResponseNov 4 at 6:47 AM\n\nThanks for your review. This is all very fair criticism. It's just me making the game, and so there are some limitations as a result of that, like the focus on room scale only and the basic behavior of the AI (which is also limited in its movement to not tangle up PC players and as a side-effect can be easily locked down). The reason I'm replying, though, is to help out with the punch strength issue you mentioned. There is no specific strength requirement to play TotF. By default, the game looks for your hardest punches and adjusts around those, so if you punch as hard as you can then you'll need to keep punching as hard as you can. The level of strength the game automatically adjusts you to emphasizes swinging at the weak areas marked on the boxing dummy, and they're intentionally a little hard to hit (and directional). My first suggestion is that you throw lighter, throw less, and aim for the weak areas to try to mostly only score high damaging yellow or red shots on the opponent. This might help with the monotonous punching issue you're mentioning and get you moving around your play area more for defensive purposes. If you don't like the automatic strength adjustment, though, you can turn off \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" at the bottom of the in-game Settings menu and use the two sliders that appear to set your level of strength to whatever feels comfortable. You might also try increasing the aggression slider in the customization menu to make the AI react less defensively to your blows to make them harder to lock down. I hope that info helps!", "VillleBNov 16 at 7:27 AM\nGreat physics and feeling, buy!\n\nI really love this fame. The gameplay is great and truly immersive.

As a solo dev without many resources focusing on a small market, I had to be laser focused with what I spent my time working on.

The idea was to try to replicate boxing as best as possible and just have it be a fun game to play in the same way people find real boxing fun, but the focus on the mechanics came at the expense of in-depth story modes or loads of extras.

The play space requirement is there to help avoid the \"slugfest\" problem you're mentioning. Having a big enough play area to stand outside of the opponents range makes a huge difference to the gameplay, which is why I stress it in the store description even though the game can technically function with smaller play area sizes. If you have real world boxing experience and/or have very fast hands, you may need to slow yourself down to 80% intensity if the Quest's tracking is having a hard time keeping up or is noticeably drifting outward. There is a damage slider - If you mean for you, you can turn off \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" in the Settings menu and will see sliders appear that will let adjust your power, or you can turn down the opponent's \"Chin/Toughness\" setting in the customization menu for a similar result. If you mean the opponent, you can turn down their \"Power\" in the customization menu. Requests for visual damage indicators are why the colored hit splashes were added to the game (blueish hits don't do much, yellowish hits hurt the opponent, and red hits severely hurt the opponent) - note that there isn't an HP bar that you're inflicting damage to and trying to empty to get knockdowns. Instead, you're trying to land individually damaging hits (primarily by targeting weak areas like the temples or side of the jaw and not just through raw strength - turning off the auto-adjust can make raw strength more of a factor) that can even potentially one-hit KO your opponent with your first hit if it lands right.", "Lunnin924Nov 1 at 7:51 AM\nWay better than Creed.\n\nAs a former boxer I can say that its far more realistic than creed only you get tired and can throw as many punches as you want. With that being said I have yet to be beat by any character even on the hardest difficulty haha.

Great game and its a great workout.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseNov 1 at 8:32 AM\n\nThanks for your review! I'm glad you're enjoying TotF, and I love hearing when real boxers \"click\" with the game. Because the AI is easier to hit than a real trained opponent would be, the game is designed to force you to aim for weak areas to drop opponents instead of just hitting with raw strength. Nailing the side of the chin can even score a one-hit KO with your very first punch in a bout (unless you're on Endurance or Outclassed mode where the opponents are artificially tougher). Since you're a real-world boxer, I'd also recommend you go to the very bottom of the in-game Settings menu and turn off the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" setting, and then use the two sliders that appear to adjust your strength. You may need to experiment with the sliders to figure out what feels the best to you, but it should help things feel consistent and maybe more in line with what you're expecting. You'll probably also want to use the \"Customization\" mode instead of picking one of the pre-set difficulty modes. You can then dial in exactly what you want from your fights. Increasing Chin/Toughness above 100% will make things artificially tougher and require you to wear down the opponent before you start seeing knockdowns, while increasing Power will make the opponent's hits much more deadly and require you to keep a tight defense.

Enjoyed enough to buy.\nIt's a lower than average game which stands out mostly due to the mediocrities of its competitors. When compared to non vr games it is very limited and less than average. So less than half stars. But not 1 star as it's still fun but that's because I like the exercise high which leads me to the conclusion It's not the game that's fun it's exercise. So the reasons this game is 5 stsr is because it tricks people into exercising and getting high... Funny how that works.\n\nHelpful | 9\nDeveloper ResponseOct 29 at 6:29 AM\n\nThanks for your review. The goal behind this game is to try to take advantage of VR to provide as authentic of a boxing experience as possible, not to try to make a traditional game with a boxing theme. The idea is that if real-world boxing is fun, then boxing in VR can be fun, too, if the experience is close enough, and it gives people who can't or won't box in the real world at least a taste of what it's like even if it's not a perfect re-creation. There is still a vast amount of room for improvement beyond what I was able to achieve on my own, but I tried to price TotF in line with what it does provide.", "fullhouse4Mar 19 at 8:27 AM\nGreat game\n\nI am 50 yrs old and this game is a great cardio workout and a blast to play.

That half star from perfect is the lack of environment and \"stationary\" crowd that just stands there staring. Would have liked to have seen different locations for different fighters and a more enthusiastic crowd... Have been through 6 fighters so far on normal and still fighting in the training gym with the same onlookers. Then again, it IS thrill of the fight and not thrill of the scenery right?\n\nThe mechanics are great. Each boxer has a different style and a different weakness. You can use one strategy on one like baiting him to swing ,that won't work on the next fighter. I give it 100% even on normal to get the most out a fight minus the moving around the ring and using the ropes. I actually boxed for 6yrs so I do a lot of movement in the game to get the most out of it. 3 rounds of nonstop movement is still a good workout.\n\nThe only thing in the game mechanic that seems a bit off is the knockdown. Seems the fighters get knocked down early on but get up and never go down again... as if their endurance and health doubled after 1 knockdown. Some rounds I score a knockdown with say 40k dmg....and the next round 150k dmg with nothing... I have yet to score 2 knock downs or a knockout in a fight.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseNov 1 at 12:12 PM\n\nThanks for your review! As a lone dev with a nonexistent budget, doing varied crowds that perform well on the Quest definitely wasn't my strength! =) However, you should only have three fights with the night gym crowd (Melky, Ugly Joe, and the Reverend). The 5th, 6th, and 7th fights (Lightning Luis, the Spider, and the Artist) should be in a different venue that's not the training gym and has a less visible audience. And then the 8th, 9th, and 10th fights (Duke, Matty, and Moneymaker) should be in a big arena venue. Since the opponents are easier to hit than a real trained boxer would be (especially one that's not limited by VR-friendly AI movement), the damage system focuses more on where you're hitting (emphasizing the weak areas marked on the dummy) rather than pure raw strength. Building up damage will help you get knockdowns more easily, but building up damage is not what determines when you get a knockdown - the exact effect of your individual swings does. Since you have some real world experience and have now spent some time with the game, you may want to go to the very bottom of the in-game Settings menu and turn off the \"Automatic Force Adjustment\" option and use the sliders that appear to adjust your strength. Only make small adjustments from the values the sliders start at (or try it without actually changing them at all), because even small changes can have a large effect on the feel of the game. Use those sliders to dial in the feel to whatever feels fun and appropriate to you based on your real-world experience - there is no \"true\" setting since everybody is going to have different body mass and be swinging differently (which is what the auto-adjust tries to make up for).", "anthony.west3Nov 5 at 5:10 AM\nDope!!!\n\nAffordable, realistic, fun boxing game that will work you.\n\nHelpful | 0", "KleezieOct 29 at 4:36 PM\nAwesome\n\nPlay it.

When the player punches it causes muscle pain on your dominant hand. And your not hitting anything and it can get addicted. Plus,\nthe repetitive motion is not healthy at all for your arms. In addition, the tracking doesnt work well while punching.\n\nHelpful | 25\nDeveloper ResponseOct 29 at 6:21 AM\n\nThanks for your review. Hopefully you were able to refund the game with Oculus. No one should ever push themselves to play a game they find is causing them to get hurt. Just as a note to all others, it is more helpful to think of this game like shadowboxing, another activity where people are repetitively throwing punches and not actually hitting anything. Make sure to punch with the rotation of your body, not just your arms, and don't overextend. If you're experiencing pain when you punch then stop and examine why you are feeling pain. You may need to change the way you punch, or you may possibly have a medical condition you should see a doctor about.", "GoldrenOct 25 at 4:32 AM\nCross Buy!\n\nGreat game and work out!\n\nHelpful | 1", "MRFINGERSOct 27 at 8:49 AM\n\nMultiplayer \n\nHelpful | 6", "doinyamom989Nov 1 at 4:56 PM\nMy theory is right\n\nThe most talked about vr game (except for beat saber) is always overrated garbage. The graphics are horrible, you actually have to have a big play space to play, there are no arms, the characters look stupid. I am never buying a game that everyone loves so much again, sariento is garbage, thrill of the fight is garbage, elven assassin is garbage, swords of gargantua is garbage. Idk what is wrong with people that they like such boring games.\n\nHelpful | 22"]
