Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement. All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.\n\nNotice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: Zhilanskaya str. 59, 02000, Kiev. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.\n\nArbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n\nAdditional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance based\narbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\nTime Limits. If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n\nWaiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.\n\nConfidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.\n\nSeverability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\nRight to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nSurvival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.\n\nSmall Claims Court. Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.\n\nEmergency Equitable Relief. Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nClaims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other partys patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nIn any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.\n\nThe Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word including means including without limitation. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Companys prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.

Were sorry that you faced difficulties when playing the game. During designing of the game levels we were trying to the greatest possible extent to take this issue into account, thats why all intervals where you need to climb are not long and they are combined with the intervals where you just move around. We are aware of the fact that according to the statistics a few percent of people are more susceptible to motion sickness and any camera movement in the game makes them feel uncomfortable. That's exactly why we made it a rule not to move the camera without a player. All movements take place only upon his consent and upon his actions. We spent hundreds of hours testing various mechanics and chose only the ones being maximally simple, comfortable and having minimal effect on vestibular apparatus. But it is quite conceivable that there are better solutions, thats why if you have any ideas or suggestions how we could remake the climb mechanics in teleport mode  please, write us at info@dream-dev.com. We continue to actively work on the game updates and we could revise this issue in one of the future updates. We hope that you will find a minute to check the game update, and maybe you will want to revise your review towards the game rating improvement.

This is a great game but I have some suggestions. You should work on incorporating a reload system for the guns, it would be a lot more immersive that way. I also think that some of the guns feel underpowered and headshots should do a bit more damage. Other than that, this is a great game and considering the specs of the oculus quest, this runs great.

(Revised review)\n\nI have picked up every early quest zombie shooter and must say, having had lower expectations here, it really blew me away.\nGuns are really super fun to shoot and serious thought has gone into the 2 handed weapons - it feels better than in any VR game I've personally played. Maximum props to the devs for that - I don't want to squint down iron sights on a rifle, waving my front hand around trying to line the gun up, I just want to hold them in front of one side and stomp around blasting like Schwarzenegger. The spread on the shotgun (which you pump between shots) and the lazer on the AR work amazingly, it just feels like it should. No toilet roll tube controller holders needed!\nThe enemy placement leads to tension at all times, till you learn to sideways walk down the halls (good luck jumpscaring me now!).\nAll in all the title is between the arcadey dual strike & the more traditional horror fps like Arizona sunshine. It's most like killing floor or COD zombies in feel to me, with its large amount of zombies. It's really action oriented.\nIt also has really good, functional climbing added in, which I love to see.\nOn the downside, it has the same problems all quest zombie games have - prepare to dome the same 6 or so zombies over again.\nFor the low price, you get so much cool stuff here.\nAs most reviews compare this to Arizona sunshine, let me add this:AZ has a massive amount of extra content and is more like a traditional game. It's less action-y. I really loved both games, but think the prices for both are fair and reflect how much game you get. For me AZ just edges it in shooting (I love its pistols), here, man is shooting fun too.\nThe devs are adding in more content, co-op across platforms would be so cool.\nAll in all well done devs, here's hoping we see more of your work on here in the future!

It can be fast-paced and you have to shoot fast which makes it fun. The development team of this game is the best I seen before. You can ask them about whenever a feature you like to see and they get back to you in a reasonable time.

I feel like my money been wasted I prefer playing drop dead double strike than.....\n3) Finally I hate the detail of the zombies very poor all this can fix by update patches but the Dev ignored the game for a long while.While other apps receiving regular updates monthly even less but this?!\nUpdate: I hate the game because it deliberately made to be hard there is no joy for a game made to be hard as for me.I'm seriously regretting not to ask for refund and now it just a piece of junks in my game library!\n\nUpdate: review to my previous nagative comments about this noble game, it was out of love of the game concept in the inception made me to purchase the game, but along the line I had some mix feeling about the game due to some difficulties I came across during the gameplay but now I'm hundred percent satisfied with the developer's detailing explanation in order clear all my misconceptions about the game.\nI just really concern about the future of the game because it is a really a great game with a lot of potentials.\nI withdrew all the previous complains I made 5/5 stars straight ahead, really the dev means business the way he took time to explain for me and advised me the way forward in regard with the game.Thanks man!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response14 days ago\n\nHey dankani05, Thank you for your comment! We understand that most likely youre upset because you spent a lot of time in the game but couldnt progress further. Were really sorry about this, we apologize. The main task of our product is to entertain and provide playing pleasure. Given that you read the comments to the game carefully, you could often see there the e-mail info@dream-dev.com. We reply to all letters that we get at this e-mail (we try to do this as quickly as possible). You could write us in any matter including the game playthrough, and you would get the answer to your question. 1. Most likely, you got stuck at the moment with the Big Boss and you were constantly trying to kill him. If this is the case, you need to run away from him further along the corridor. It makes no sense to shoot at him  in this part of the game he is invulnerable. There are hints about this on the wall at the beginning of the corridor. In addition, there is the full game playthrough on YouTube from other players. For example, this one: https://youtu.be/lsVcbQzHTzY. 2. Concerning the game updates. Not only we write that we make regular game updates, but we really release them. How do you think, how long does development of the new location take (with the new locations, enemies, weapons)? And, for example, addition of multiplayer mode into the game? And the new mode  Horde Mode? 2-3 weeks for each task? All this takes us months of everyday work. Now its almost 2 years that we have been working non-stop on this project. From the moment of the game release (September 2019), we have already released 9 updates. 3 of them were global ones. The first global update - Oct 18, 2019. We remade the game for the new type of controls  locomotion. The second global update - Apr 08, 2020. In that update, we added the new chapter, the Big Boss, new weapons and we also improved the graphics throughout the whole game. The third global update - Jun 12, 2020. In this update, we added secret rooms, collectibles, and achievements. The next global update will be with Co-op and it is scheduled for Q3 2020. Yet, that will be not just Co-op, in fact there will be a lot of other additional things available, e.g. the project localization in 6 new languages. We would really want to release the updates faster and be consistent with your expectations  the new update every several weeks or at least once per month, however, what can we do for a short period of time? Add several weapons or several new enemies? Would you be satisfied if the updates would be rather formal instead of being global? One more thing about already existing and future updates. All game updates being already made and the ones that will be made at the very least this year were and will be absolutely free of charge for all already existing players. We dont add the new locations in order to sell them as DLC or new modes in order to ask additional in-app for this. The roadmap of the updates for this year is as follows: 1. Co-op - Q3 2020; 2. Melee Weapons - Q4 2020; 3. Horde Mode - Q4 2020; 3. Concerning the way the zombies look. We would greatly appreciate if you could describe in a little bit more detail what exactly did induce such your reaction. Insufficient detailing of the enemies? Their animations? You see, its just not quite clear from your comment. And could you, please, also give an example of the game on Oculus Quest (in the same genre) where enemies look better than in our game? Oculus Quest is a mobile device and it has a number of technical limitations that developers have to face. We would be pleased to improve the picture in the game and we have everything ready for this, but we cant do a lot of things due to the fact that we hit a glass ceiling in terms of the capacity. But we love Quest for other things  first of all, for its mobility. And for the fact that actually at this point it is the simplest, most available and just the best way to consume VR content. 4. The difficulty level of the game. There is the choice of difficulty level in the game, and you can at any moment switch between Easy and Hard without loss of your progress. Of course, if you got stuck somewhere and cant progress  this wont help, but I hope that we were able to answer this question above. And in conclusion, wed like to say: We would really like if after reading of this explanation to your review you would at least slightly change your attitude to the game for the better. Should you have any questions  feel free to write at info@dream-dev.com. Well always reply. Kind regards, Dream Dev Studio VR", "EdmCaper14 days ago\nMy favorite zombie shooter\n\nReally looking forward to the next chapter and multiplayer. The weapons look great, and are satisfying to reload and look for ammo. The game keeps you on your toes always looking behind you. It's challenging and at sometimes frustrating to get past certain areas , in fact I had to watch a YouTube playthrough to figure out what to do with a certain gigantic zombie. My only complaint would be the hour or so I wasted on that zombie before giving up temporarily and searching out the solution online. Once I learned the solution and made it past the zombie, the lady (that talks to you throughout the story), congratulated me and confirmed that what I did was the only way to survive that particular zombie. Possibly I missed some clues during the play that would have gave me some insight but I don't believe so. I typically play games slow and look everywhere and explore as much as I can in games to extend their life.\n\nHowever, even with that very small issue, it never stopped me from being obsessed to continue and make it to the end.\n\nIt gives me the same satisfaction as Lies Beneath as far as keeping me on my toes, but also giving me an arsenal of weapons to carry and switch and use in combat. It's very much a 5 star title and those who enjoy shooting games along with creepy environments, this should be a no brainer.\n\nOne more tiny complaint but not worthy of changing my star rating or talking about in great length is that towards the end of the game there is an elevator shaft to climb up. Very easy to climb up, however no matter how hard I concentrated , it was extremely difficult to climb down. So much so, that after falling to my death over and over again, I decided to actually jump off a separate ledge to get me back to the main floor. However, I believe the intent of the game is to climb back down the elevator shaft. Again, I could be wrong, but I wasted a lot of time trying to do something as simple as climb down an elevator.\n\nVery much look forward to the new chapter. Great game that keeps getting better .\n\n(Edit: after seeing the developers comments, I went back and yes there are clues, and I was oblivious to them my first playthrough. I was merely looking for more ammo and not even trying to look for clues. So I mark this up to 'my bad!'. I'm happy to hear there was hints all along and it was simply just me that never noticed them. Oops)\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response14 days ago\n\nHi EdmCaper, Thank you for your review!

Currently, there are 9 types of weapons in the game  not 5: 1) 1911 MODEL, 2) AR-15, 3) DEATH EAGLE, 4) 59 SHOCKWAVE, 5) VECTOR, 6) SCAR, 7) SAWED-OFF, 8) G-17 TACTICAL, 9) MAC-10. If need be, we can send you all weapon location areas, so that you can see it for yourself that they are present there. All the things shown in Death Horizon: Reloaded game trailer absolutely line up with reality. Maybe, you mixed something up with the previous part of the game - Death Horizon (for Oculus Go), but it had much less content than the new part. The difference between Death Horizon and Death Horizon: Reloaded is profound  in addition to the fact that it is possible to move freely around the location in Death Horizon: Reloaded, there is also the climb mechanics in the new part of the game  you can climb the pipes, ladders, ropes, etc. - The new part of the game is several times longer than the previous part. - The new part of the game is better in terms of graphics. - There are many more possibilities in the new part of the game (e.g. its possible to interact with the objects). - Apart from that, we keep working on the game updates  for example, the next major update will be with co-op, after it  melee weapons update, then  horde mode update, and the new chapter update. All these updates will be free for already existing players  no DLC, no in-app purchase or anything else.

Stupid me, I missed it when it was on daily deal but even for the full 15 quid it is so worth it, it is absolutely brilliant. The satisfaction of wielding a couple of Desert Eagles and laying waste to a few of the undead in whatever fashion you fancy is just so satisfying. The immersion is just excellent and you do get a shiver down the spine when a few of them are running at you and you have to decide which one to pop first.\nAs a few reviews have said it would be a great addition if melee weapons were introduced, I think swinging an axe or a spiked baseball bat at a few of the undead would be just great but the developers do seem to read and reply to reviews so hopefully something will come in a future update up until then I'll put it on hard and just keep blasting away.\nJust buy it, you'll love it.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper ResponseJun 30 at 1:56 AM\n\nHey HarleyMadDad, Thank you for your review.

There is also throwable explosive canisters that explode when touching a zombie or being really close to one.\nLocations: There are multiple locations in the game you go through, and you get keycards to progress through higher level doors. The environment is really spooky and is like a warehouse type environment, but you are in a laboratory. And with the secret rooms update coming, youll be able to explore those places looking for those secrets :)\nClimbing: Climbing is a really big part of the game as no zombie game has ever done this before. Climbing is unique and its very spooky sometimes when youre above very big heights.\nLength: With chapter 2 just coming out, the length of the gameplay is about 2 hours and 30 minutes but with secret rooms coming and achievements, there is gonna be replayability. However, replaying the game now is still as fun as ever too. Blasting zombies while hanging from a pipe, etc.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIf you are a fan of zombie games and some good jump scares and spooks, Death Horizon: Reloaded is for you. A guaranteed 5 stars for its price, its uniqueness and for the amazing developers that are very active on their discord and here. BUY IT!!\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper ResponseMay 19 at 12:23 AM\n\nHey JourneyOnQuest, Thank you for your detailed review.

Firstly, the thing that attracted me to buying this game was the developer's attitude. They listen to the customers opinions, both positive and negative, and work very hard to improve their product. As a developer myself, I have played around with developing a game for the Quest (as a lock down hobby), and can say that they have managed to squeeze out some spectacular results from a wonderful, but limited machine. This game hasn't been built, but crafted and in a world where there are extremely powerful computers & games consoles, and software houses with hundred's of millions of pounds worth of budget, what they have achieved is almost mind blowing. Lastly, however good the game is today, I know that it will be better tomorrow, as they are continually adding improvements to it.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJul 9 at 4:38 AM\n\nHey nickblooruk, Thank you for your feedback!

BEST purchase I've made on the quest in a long time!! When I was looking for something new to play, there it was, right under my nose the entire time!! WHY IS THIS GAME NOT BETTER HYPED IN THE OCCULUS STORE???? It's not arizona sunshine. It has a much different feel and play style. More of a Res. Evil VR experience than other quest zombie games. Thats the charm. A little nostalgic, takes influence from it's predecessors, with the modern mechanics you only dreamed of way back when!! Weapons and weapon effects are outstanding (feel/sound) with great choices in variety. I don't know if this was by choice or some kind of limitations (character models look good) but I like the slightly angular look of the dogs! Throw back baby! This game is great with more to come.

This game is fun without the good reloading mechanics. I feel this game fits around the price, $15 is right ( I bought it on sale) but extra $5 will be worth it once the co op comes out. Ive played this game for a couple weeks before writing a review to make sure I got the full experience. At first I felt bored because I expected too much from this game just like everyone else who bought it. Although after a while I started to like it again. I feel this game is very fun zombie blaster, although repetitive levels and environments but still climbing and blasting zombies. I dont know what more I was expecting out of this game but I have high hopes for the multiplayer. I really hope its an actual multiplayer and not the dual strike bullsh* where you can compare your scores but not actually fight with others. Please developers let me know if you can actually play with your friends or not.\nAll in all, Im actually very satisfied with this game, I love the dual desert eagles and the machine guns. A little lighter environment would put some art into the game though. However once this multiplayer part comes into play, and if it is how I think, then this game is definitely worth the money. I feel a bit lonely when shooting zombies by myself but if youre looking for a good zombie killing experience without melee weapons then this is the best. Climbing adds a good factor although there isnt much. this game fits its price and is still in development so when you buy it keep in mind its not a full game. But that doesnt mean its not worth buying its still loads of fun and Ive put def a few hours into the campaign and still not completed. Exploding zombies heads with dual deagles is super satisfying and worth the money in my eyes. Im glad the developers are still working hard on this game and havent gaven up like Arizona sunshine. The only downside from this apart from Arizona sunshine is the lack of multiplayer because blasting zombies with friends is better than alone. If thats added then this is no doubt better then Arizona sunshine. The solo play is definitely superior to AS. Overall, this game is a good zombie shooting beta with secret rooms, variety of weapons and zombies, climbing, and satisfying killing. I wouldnt have spent my $15 on anything else. I will definitely continue playing\n\nP.S. adding rag doll zombie deaths would be so funny and also adds a sense of realism.

Played for weeks but I just play a level or two a day. Seemed to glitch out on me the first time near the end so I had to replay from the beginning. No worries it was a blast playing through again especially with my improved skills. Maybe the most under rated game on the Quest. Poppin heads was never so much fun. The more you play the better it gets. Great graphics, sound, music, emersion and game play. Each level is like a tactical puzzle as you must analyze and plan out your attack. If a level seems too hard to pass, like the boss levels, take a breather and use your head to figure out a workable strategy. Its not too short, as I have been playing it for weeks and Im still on the normal difficulty setting. The developers are responsive and have updated the game. Shows they care. Took about four sessions to get comfortable with the controls. Guns seem easier to grab now. When opening lockers work from right to left so the opened doors dont get in the way. When picking up objects aim high squeeze and move downward this way you dont grab the key card by mistake. Maybe it would help if you had to press the trigger also for the key card to keep you from grabbing it by accident. Other tips: Set it up for always run. Walking is too slow. Shot gun is slow you have to practice pumping and shooting quickly. Best to use when zombies are coming evenly paced so you have time to pump and shoot. This saves your other ammo. Throw weapons and canisters through doorways and across platforms so you can continue to access them. Another important strategy is hanging from pipes/ladders and shooting with one hand. This will help you survive some levels because the zombies cant reach you. This game is definitely scary and intense. Crazy hard near the end. Big Boss tips: Run, hide, lure and run again. Shoot him once gains a second while he laughs at you. You can run faster when not holding a weapon. Cant wait to play it some more. Im glad I bought it!

Climbing is cool...The variety of the enemies are great I've only got one real hang up..... You can never trust that you cleared a room... The enemies defy the laws of physics because I can clear a room with only one tiny ventilation shaft walk down the hall and a huge zombie comes out of that room...i end up taking myself out of the experience because my brain says that's not possible....the environment is really dark as well. It's a personal thing in sure but i would enjoy it a bit more of it was a couple lumens higher... Or give me a flashlight....lol five stars if not for that one thing.

I also noticed that at easier difficulty, spawning vents behind you are blocked off, which is a nice touch. I beat it once in normal before the chapter update, but I thought I might play a casual game on easy. So far, its great! Also, the gun range is GREAT! It allows me to appreciate the little things, like the gun collision, recoil, and how they actually handle. Given its a secret area, its hard to get to, so the climb is definitely a chore. Changing it to a lever you flick that opens a door on ground level would make it easier to access. Otherwise, the update is amazing, and definitely improved the feeling of a play through.

I must say it's a pretty great. I would probably say that most will be impressed. If I was critical, I would suggest more interactions and exploring. It would be cool to be able to pick up a zombie head and throw it at another zombie. it would also be cool if you could have malee weapons and be able to dismember zombies,but that's just a wish list for future updates. Verdict: it's a really great zombie shooter and good job by the devs.I love shooters in VR and I would highly recommend this game.....so just buy it already..\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 18 at 12:14 AM\n\nHi hail2theking28, Thank you for your review!

I really appreciate the climbing mechanic as that is something that I love in vr. My biggest problem is that some of the guns especially pistols dont aim like they do in other shooter because the angle is different and there is no way to change that. So if the devs could fix that it would be great with maybe a gun angle option for kinds of guns so that it doesnt mess up all of them. Im really glad that they keep updating this too! Definitely worth a buy if you want a more shooty zombie game than saints and sinners coming out later this year or whenever it comes out.

Regarding a possibility to connect two devices being logged in to one account to one multiplayer game, well see if it is possible to implement this from a technical point of view, keeping in mind the specificity of connection to the server and the need to identify different users.

Maybe there should be a training range or a controlled environment where you can get used to the zombies for the people who arent really that fan of zombies. I am looking forward for seeing coop mode. Although I dont have any friends with an oculus quest, maybe there could be added matchmaking for that.

However: I'm tired of looting lockers/places, because locomotion is a chore (e.g. there's a big delay after each teleporting). Guns and ID card can easily fall to the floor if I don't carefully put them onto my belt. Damaging the enemy has too little feedback (unlike Drop Dead), therefore less fun. Being damaged by enemy also has too little feedback -- sometimes I just suddenly die without noticing how, and it just immediately reloads the last checkpoint, which was very confusing (I thought it was a bug). Overall, I prefer Drop Dead, but this game can be just as good after some tweaks.\n\nUpdate:\nNow I love it. It's immersive and fun. Smooth locomotion mode made it good for my small space, though a little sickening. I like playing it on easy mode, at a relaxing pace. I love the various guns. The physics is very good. You can bump your gun against objects/walls.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 17 at 12:22 AM\n\nHey JimZM, Thank you very much for updating your review!

Im about 90% through my 2nd time playing and find myself repeating I love this game every time I end a session. Its not perfect (what game is) but it is loads of fun. Great way to escape and great use of VR to make you feel you are there. Im always amazed how spot-on the aiming is. Thanks for a wonderful game!! I cant wait to co-op with a friend (and make them go into a room first- haha)\nOLD REVIEW:\nI really love this game. Def had some frustrating elements before the update. I just played again (starting from the beginning) and the update helped a lot!!! I had so much fun blasting zombies. The gun action and graphics have really improved. Def LOVE the background music as well (it helps to know when zombies are coming)\nThe only issue I still seem to run into is grabbing the gun from my belt unintentionally when trying to grab ammo (then dropping it on the floor).\nI can also tell the throwing mechanism has definitely improved. Love being able to toss my 4th weapon (that I cant holster) around as well as the grenades.\nGreat job on the new update Devs!!!

Over time I realise I have played it through more than any other game. The recent big update has transformed the graphics and the extra campaign is great, in places it is very well designed. Everything happens in sequence and makes each section enjoyable to repeat as you learn the best approach to tackling it. I don't like the swinging locker doors that block off the next door along, neither do I enjoy having to collect the ammo at the restart of each stage. Leave the guns to be selected each time you restart so you can pick the most suitable, but the ammo is something you need, so it does feel a bit tiresome having to strip the lockers. Very much looking forward to future updates, I would also happily pay for new content. A good pair of headphones and the sound of the shotgun in action restores the star lost to those swinging locker doors.\n\nHelpful | 8\nDeveloper ResponseApr 23 at 4:20 AM\n\nHey Boulderhog, Thank you for your feedback and high rating for our game!

In September 2019 there was the project launching, then a number of the updates in fall 2019, then the major update on the 9th of April, 2020 (the new chapter, new weapons, improved graphics), then the update with Secret Rooms that is absolutely ready but we have to wait till the situation currently taking place in the US improves. Further on were already working on the next updates - Co-op, Horde Mode, New Chapter. Our roadmap is stuffed with the updates till the end of this year. All these updates will be free for already existing users, were not going to add in them any obligatory in-app purchases or sell this as DLC.

The looting in the game feels great, but it would be even better if you could loot almost everything, like shelves and filing cabinets. If they did this, they could add more pickups, but nerf the amount of ammo from the pickups. It does make me somewhat disappointed that the story isn't completely finished yet.

Honestly the game play itself, although well done, wouldn't stand out from the crowd on a regular game system, but that it's done so effectively in VR takes it to a whole different level. You will really feel like you are there, fighting off zombies in a dimly lit research facility. The controls implementation (shooting, changing weapons, using key cards, running, climbing) is first rate and once you learn it, becomes second nature and never breaks the feeling of immersion. There's teleporting for those of us with small playspaces. The zombies have good AI and shooting them feels real. The graphics, especially after the April 2020 update, are as good as the Quest is likely to produce (kind of like a PS2, but when your software is running on an older cell phone chipset, that's what you should expect) and are certainly good enough to create a high level of immersion.

However I feel like the gameplay loop can get very predictable and get repetitive the more you play. When you see a corridor, youll know zombies will come out the further you walk so you end up going back into a corner and killing them from there, at a certain point it loses its fun factor. Itll be hard to address this since its abstract and the game is already made, so significant changes will turn it into a different game. What Im thinking is adjust zombie placement so that each segment will be better suited for a certain weapon (ie. in long corridors spawn zombies far ahead of you to give you enough time to use your assault rifle, or have zombies come out of rooms in a long hallway close to you so a shotgun favors that situation, or have zombies coming at you from multiple sides to favor dual pistols). Maybe new armoured zombie types with weak points can spice things up too.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 1 at 1:51 AM\n\nHi jayloonar94, Thank you for your review and suggestions.

Played 10 minutes of it tried to return it and was denied. Was told to read the refund policy. Dont get stuck with an awful game like I did. Youre allowed a few returns and thats it then get cutoff without warning.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJun 19 at 1:35 AM\n\nDear DeepMellow, Thank you for your comment. It's really a pity that you didnt like the game and that you faced the problem when trying to make a refund. Developers have no impact on Oculus rules and have no access to the refund system. For our part, in such cases, we would prefer to refund the money to avoid such emotional reaction that you showed in your review. Concerning your complaint about the gameplay and graphics. Insomuch as weve been regularly releasing the free updates improving the game for more than 8 months now, we would greatly appreciate if you could find a minute and provide more detailed review. 1. You wrote that the game has bad boring gameplay  could you tell in a bit more detail what exactly did you expect and what didnt you like? What is the game lacking in your opinion? 2. You second complaint is terrible graphics. Could you, please, tell if you compare the game in terms of graphics with the level of PC VR or Console? Yes, the graphics in the game is not at the level of AAA projects of PC/Console. On the mobile chipset Snapdragon 835 being used in Oculus Quest, its just impossible technically. Oculus Quest is to a greater extent not about the graphics level, it is about freedom of movement, comfort, and ease of VR use. These are exactly the things we love this device for. At our end, we have everything ready to make the graphics in the project several times better. We can improve the quality of textures, add realistic light sources, post-processing, effects  but all this plainly bumps up against the technical maximum of the device. You would be able to see all these graphical improvements once the game is released for PC VR. Basing on the reviews from other players we can state with confidence that the level of graphics in our game is higher than in similar projects on the Oculus Quest platform (if desired you can check the reviews of the game yourself). We would be grateful if you could show us as an example of any game (in this genre) available on Oculus Quest that in your opinion looks better. Please, write its title and well gladly compare our product with the one that youll cite as an example. Product optimization takes up almost 40% of the development time. I.e. if youre developing the game for a year, about 4-5 months from this period are devoted to making the game present the necessary level of performance and the acceptable graphics level. But we understand and take fully into account that users dont have to know about this. That users have every right to want the graphics of AAA projects level even on mobile device. And if their expectations dont materialize, they can be very much upset. And as a consequence, they can write such emotional reviews. --- If we summarize everything: --- 1. Were sorry that you didnt like the game and as a consequence, you wanted to make a refund. 2. If we could affect the decision about refunding, we would just give the money back to you. 3. Well appreciate if you find a minute and describe what didnt you like in the gameplay, what did you expect and, maybe, your recommendations as to its improvement. 4. Were looking forward to seeing from you the example of the game from Oculus Quest platform with better graphics than in our game. We would really want to understand what is a good graphics for you and what should we strain after. You can always write your answer as the update of your review or at our e-mail info@dream-dev.com. We regularly read the messages and reply all letters. For our part, we would really want you to change your attitude toward our product for the better. We release the game updates on a regular basis making it better. We put 100% of the whole our team time into this and we release all updates free of charge for already existing players.

After Just a little while I was running and gunning like a pro, pulling off headshots on the move while dual wielding pistols.\n\n\nCons:\nIncomplete - at the time of writing, there are several features inaccessible, such as multiplayer and the final chapter of the game. Although the devs seem active, I can only rate the game based off of its current state.\n\n\nOverall:\nWhen I first purchased the game (it was on the daily deal) I was still new to vr and suffering from motion sickness. By the end of the game (took maybe a week of playing about 20 minutes a day) the sickness had almost completely gone, so it's at least good for training up your endurance.\n\nalthough the final chapter is missing, the length is about right, so I'm not sure adding a new chapter will add anything of value to the game, multiplayer possibly would be worth it, depending on if it's a death match or co-op.\n\nI prefer this game over Arizona sunshine myself due to the pacing and gunplay.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 27 at 1:12 AM\n\nHey MasterDecoySG, Thank you for your review.

Episode 2 introduces new guns, enemies and flow. This game allows you to create your own fighting style. After enough time, you learn how to deal with specific enemies and apply strategies vs just run and gun. The boss is intense. A few tips:\n\nChange your settings to running all the time. No need to walk in episode 2.\n\nTry ducking and peaking off edges with your gun vs nurses.\n\nThrow all of your weapons through the door into the first room. They can disappear sometimes when dropped after closing a safe room door.\n\nMaking it to the next door in episode 2 is life or death. When you get to the door, you need to slightly slow down the card reading process. If I was too close or tried to read the card too fast, it doesnt always work.\n\nLooking forward to episode 3. Great value and developers!\n\n\n\nAfter a few levels, you start to break into the story. Each safe zone levels up your weapons, ammo and opens a short dialogue. Its a rewarding process. When I mention retro, this feels like back in the day when you would look for satisfying games on the PC late 90s to mid 2,000s. This would fit in the gem category. Its a nice balance of simplicity while trying to figure out your playing style. I would throw extra weapons into a room and use their ammo up before going back to my main guns.

When I say that Death Horizon could have been the Arizona Sunshine of the Quest, I am not talking about graphic quality (though Death Horizon IS very average visually and on a GO level, not up to what Quest can offer) but in terms of variety of environments, situations and length overall. This game only offers the same textures and environments structure all the way, a way that is barely longer than an hour and without a decent ending!

You need to fight and that consumes to much ammo even with headshots. 2. Climbing to pull the switch at the top with more ranged zombies can be hard to do because of the splash damage range. 3. The ending area (the part that most will rage at) is just hard enough with ranged and runners but both at the same time requires to much ammo to pass the level.

Just played the next segment of the campaign. Multiplayer is on it's way and im quite hopeful it will be good! The shooting action is great and doing that with a friend would be even better. The guns are fun, shooting feels pretty realistic. I still think this game and Gun Club need to have a baby. The running speed in this game is excruciatingly slow, but granted they dont want you just sprinting through the map to win. Everything moves pretty smooth.

It was great back then and the most recent update as of writing this review, made the game even better. The new chapters have a huge step up in lvl design and gameplay, and when i say gameplay i mean that its not just about shooting everything in front of you so you have to think of other ways of making it to the next safe room. The new weapons are great too but right now we dont have enough lvls yet to play around with them enough in my opinion.\nWith these new powerful weapons the ammo limit becomes a bit of a problem, 300ar and 150 handgun ammo is not enough and should be increased or just removed outright, or even better put it as a setting option for the hardcore players to get a bigger challange to earn higher scores. The shotgun ammo cap is fine because the shotguns damage makes up for it.\nLastly the graphics are nothing out of this world but its good and fits games atmoshpere.

As to the giant (Big Boss), the hint about the actions you should perform with him is available at the beginning of the level (pay attention to the inscriptions on the walls), actually, in order to move on you need to run away from him (to the end of the tunnel, open the door and move on).

Got my pulse racing a few times. The graphical upgrade is really impressive. (This improvement has come at a cost in the form of more noticeable aliasing, but the positives far outweigh this one downside in my opinion). The new weapons add welcome variety to the combat. I especially like the sawn-off shotgun. All in all, fantastic stuff.\n\nUpdate: I've now played through the game several times. The mechanics are so smooth, the action so engaging, that I think this game has a lot of replay value. This makes up for the fact that it's a short playthrough. I feel I've got my money's worth so I changed my rating to 5 stars.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI loved it. Everything worked way better than I was expecting based on the negative reviews. I guess those are pre-update reviews?\n\nThis is a game that has moments of frantic blasting but also rewards careful aiming and ammo management. Aiming down the sights, as you would in real life, worked better for me in this game than any other shooter. The Movement also works well, especially moving while shooting. You can't rapidly strafe and sprint back and forth while emptying countless magazines like in an oldschool FPS, and that's a good thing IMO. Careful movements work brilliantly. It feels like there's a real strategy to playing well.\nThe climbing sections were smooth and added variety. More climbing would be great IMO.\n\nMinor complaints:\n1. Overuse of vents. There are about 40 human-sized vents in every hallway and seven in every room. Zombies *always* emerge from them. It gets old. And why would any structure have that many enormous vents???\n\n2. The disembodied hand. It's just too goofy. It seems more like something from a spoooooooooooky Halloween cartoon than an otherwise atmospheric zombie shooter.\n\n3. Having zombies make a noise before attacking from behind would give the player more scares and a chance to do something. When all you get is a damage indicator going off, there's no suspense or enjoyment.\n\n4. It's too easy. I went straight to hard mode and rarely had any difficulty finishing a level. I was excited to try \"Impossible\" mode but it turns out that just means no saving is allowed.\n\nOne huge complaint:\nIt's not finished! I completed it in a day over about 3 or 4 play sessions. And the ending is a big pile of nothing. Essentially you get a message saying \"to be continued\". I was all set to enjoy the hell out of this game over a week or so, and then it stopped.\n\nPs. In any future updates, varieties in environment would really be welcome. Flashlight levels, bright levels, open areas and narrow corridors. I think this is one key aspects of great VR games. Seeing the same color palette and structures over and over in VR becomes really opressive. Even if variations are superficial they can really help IMO.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 11 at 6:06 AM\n\nHey eoinok, Thank you very much for updating your review!

Simply put: It's excellent.\n\nNow, it did take me a little while to get used to it. This game has it's own pace which might differ from what you'd expect. Sometimes slow and steady is the way forward, other times, it's run and gun. You really have to allow yourself to relax into the game and you'll soon get a feel for what the situation requires.\nI had to get used to arming myself properly from the locker room between levels and approaching situations differently, but that keeps the game so interesting, even when the environments don't vary too much.\n\nOnce used to everything the game mechanics are great! The guns are amazing to hold and fire, and beat any other shooting game I've played. The two handed weapons, which I've struggled with in other games, are perfect here. Keeping track of ammo both on your belt and your wrist (held weapon) is a great device as when you're low on ammo, it really forces you to check each gun laying around a prey one has a few rounds left in it. Object interaction is also solid; opening and closing doors and hitting objects feels so real. I especially love how your hand will push things without needing to press the grip. This means you can use the tip of your gun to knock things, or just catch a swinging door before it closes. Throwing canisters to use as explosives is also very well done, you really feel their weight\n\nLove the graphical style too. Yes it looks softer and lower resolution than some but this actually helps it look more real. It may not be the sharpest or most defined, but it's actually my favorite looking game on the quest!\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 6 at 2:44 AM\n\nHey RattleKat, Thank you for your really comprehensive feedback.

Some of the hallways start to feel a bit tedious, especially as you can clear everything multiple times and yet still as you move a few more steps forward something spawns behind you.

You respawn in a safe room with your guns and ammo after your health runs dry. Accurate enough shots. 3 save slots for family members. Long enough to get your money worth.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\n No interaction with backgrounds, severe clipping on doors (your gun drops) Hopefully they can fix that up...\n Jump is extremely janky, looks so unnatural and difficult to time it.\n No side missions, no Easter eggs or secrets (that I've found anyway.)\n Holding items like guns reduces walk speed - a big gun in each hand reduces you to a dead crawl (plus no run button)\n\n\n* Developers released a fantastic update recently, the whole game looks better. Even the menus got a polish, the whole game feels more bling now well done guys!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 13 at 1:07 AM\n\nHi Tony.DiIuorio, Thank you for your review.

I had to go back to an earlier save spot in the game.\nI wish I would have been warned that proceeding was going to lose my progress.\nAlthough this may be a good thing, because I now know some options that will save my bullets.

Zombies do not have physics. There are no melee weapons at least so far into my playthrough. I don't really like it maybe you will\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 8 at 11:55 PM\n\nHey Skynyrd333, Thank you for your feedback. Oculus Quest is based on mobile processor (Snapdragon 835), the same is installed in Samsung S8. In addition, for VR its necessary to count up two images at once (for each eye)  and this is an additional load. Realistic physics you are writing about in your review is relatively easily implementable for PC projects (insomuch as there is used power of computers), but for mobile devices such as Quest this is quite difficult task. Thats why for the time being you wont find any game for Quest that would be fully based on physics and at that would have normal graphics. We understand that its absolutely not interesting for users to know about the limitations that developers face, but anyways we have to take into account the device functional limitations. We put a lot of efforts to improve the game  e.g. in the previous update we improved the graphics, added the new content. In a little while there will be another update - with secret rooms, collectibles, and achievements. And in one of the next updates we want to make something you wanted to see in the game  to add melee weapons.

Some have said the graphics aren't great but I disagree... with the limitations of the quest hardware in mind, this game looks great. The Zombies look good and can even be quite frightening when they are 2ft from your face or sneaking up behind you. If your easily scared by Zombies DON'T buy this game. There was more than one occasion when I thought I was clear only to turn around and have a zombie right behind me... that will almost always make you jump. There are plenty of other jump scares in this game too. I have only done a couple levels so far but from that experience alone id say get this game!!

The graphics are also pretty bad but honestly the graphics dont really matter. No matter how fake the graphics look I still found myself getting immersed in the game and having a good time. Would recommend! I would give the game a 3.5 but I cant so let just pretend its a 3.5\n\nEdit- Wow. Just Wow. I am beyond impressed with what the devs are doing. They were already working on most of the concerns/dislikes I had. Ive never seen any dev team care this much about bettering their game and creating the best game possible. To top it all of, the game is literally 15$ I would like to re-word what I said before the graphics are pretty bad I didnt mean theyre terrible cause they arent. Hands down the graphics are better than Arizona Sunshine, but I do think the zombies could use a bit of a graphical upgrade along with some of the wall textures. I also think some more gore would make the game a lot better. Other than that the game is great, their is a good amount of weapons to find. This will be the best 15$ you ever spend!

I am still early into the game (about 16%) but was so blown away I had to take the time to review. Thats something I rarely do! I usually give a game at least a few weeks worth of plays before reviewing but thats just a testament to how good this game really is. So lets hit some of the winning points!\n\n1. Music and immersion will leave you truly feeling like your in a real life horror film! Personally I shut the music off only so I can hear if a zed is shuffling up behind me in the heated moments.\n\n2. Gun play can feel pretty good pistol is pretty solid (pro tip: you wanna save on ammo dont be afraid to get up in the undeads face and pop them between the eyes) the assault rifle I typically one hand but that probably has more to do with the oculus controls then accuracy of weapons.\n\n3. story feels pretty solid even hiding the mystery of who you are (YouTubed this info) I wont give it away here but looking into this game and what it had to offer led me upon this info.\n\n4 variety. With different weapons you can find what suits you best.\n\n5. Free content!!! Im not gonna say anything that this hasnt already been said by others or for its self. Support these guys! Not only do they listen to the fans but the also reward the fans with free content unlike some other zombie games (cough Arizona sunshine cough) that charge you for DLCs to access parts of a game that should have already been included or at the very least tagged on up front.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n\nmelee weapons (if this hasnt already been added). Sometime your in a jam and it would be nice to conserve ammo... maybe even throw a knife at a zombie.\n\nCoop missions. Team up with others as part of a Horizon clean up crew. What other nightmares lurk in those labs? ( feel free to use that )\n\nSpecial weapons?? Flamethrower, explosive bow, auto turret, etc.\n\nKeep up the great work guys!

Also relies too much on the zombie behind you theme. You walk into a room and clear the zombies. walk into next room and zombies appear behind you from vents or whatever from nowhwere. Why a secured facility with high tech secured doors have so many man sized vents that seem to allow any Tom, sally and harry to get in really spoils the atmosphere and experiance. The random zombie noises are annoying also.I also hate leaving guns behind full of ammo..Having said that its good to shoot twin carbines. The shot gun is nice to fire too and the sounds are satisfying.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseApr 13 at 1:03 AM\n\nHey Gedel, Thank you for your review. Every review is important for us. We are constantly improving the game by releasing new updates. Regarding the places of zombies appearance (e.g. large ventilation) we hear such complaints on rare occasions. But if logical aspect is important for you, it will be pretty much expanded in the next update (in May, when well release the update with secret rooms), and then it will be further explained in the update with the final chapter (most likely that will be in the fall).

Such a shame.\n\n-update-\n\nSorry dont no where to actualy reply to the response.\n\nNot in a bad way but i had no idea there would be any clue to defeat a boss (or pass a boss) as the rest of the game was just point and shoot so natural reaction was to unload everh bullet lol.\n\nDefo maybe add more hints in... and as for the playing position i dont think ive ever played a shooting game seated  .. only driving games.. also reset the position and it stayed as a giant so a manual belt adjustment feature would defo help \n\nWhen this is added so im not 7ft lol ill happily alter my full review \n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 15 at 2:34 AM\n\nHey BeatzCreations, Thank you for your review. Lets begin from the new enemy  the Big Boss. He is bulletproof in this chapter, thats why it does not make sense to spend your ammo on him. The hint about this is available at the beginning of the level (pay attention to the inscriptions on the walls), but apparently this is not enough, and thats why well add several more hints about his invulnerability in the next updates. Actually, in order to move on you need to run away from him (to the end of the tunnel, open the door and move on). Regarding the position of the belt  it gets adjusted to your altitude. If you are playing in the seated position (the game doesnt provide for such mode and information about this is available in Supported Player Modes section), the belt really can be in some uncomfortable place. If youre playing in the standing position, there shouldnt arise such problems (but if they arise, then, please, in the device settings try to recalibrate your Oculus Quest). Alongside this, in one of the next updates were going to add the possibility to adjust the belt altitude  this should exclude such issues. Also, should you have any questions, you can always write us at info@dream-dev.com. We have high hopes that this information will help you to progress in the game and that youll find a minute to revise your review and change the rating. Thank you!", "jswiggsFeb 26 at 6:15 PM\nAwesome zombie shooter\n\nGreat game devs, I know it's already been said but about the reloading issue. The first game I purchased was gun club vr.

The movement is great I didnt get any sickness or nausea which your experience may differ, but for me it's common I VR. The game looks great for a stand alone headset devs did a great job with that. I personally love the guns in this game just touch your self to reload it's simple and focus on the shooting. There is more like the atmosphere and level designs being awesome aswell but you should experience them for yourself.\n\nSo let's get onto the cons which I personally can only think of two the first being no melee options do once you are out of ammo you have to run or die, unless I missed somthing. This isn't really a problem as you get plenty of ammo around the map although I'm a bit trigger happy. The second is how short it is. Just as you think the real fun and story is about to start you ar met with a\nto be continued. . .\nI'm sure there is more to come in the future but as for right now it's only a couple hours long.\n\nI've played through once so far on normal difficulty and can be sure I'm going in again with the next difficulty.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 25 at 3:31 AM\n\nHey levelpuke, Thank you for your detailed review.

The main frustration I have with the game is it does not allow me to change the Oculus home button to the right controller. Every time I grab or shoot in a heated situation, I inadvertently press down on the home button and find myself removed from the scene. I had this problem with Lies Beneath and found it offered a way to configure the home button to the other controller. If I don't have that option, the game ends up crashing causing me to restart the headset. I also find the weapons belt clumsy and the jumping function very clumsy. The shotgun doesn't work well at all as I can't seem to pump another round in the chamber without first holstering it.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 30 at 1:57 AM\n\nHey Choogie, Thank you for your feedback.

I wanted it but wasn't sure about it due to almost nothing more than seeing it took multiple headshots. I finally purchased the game based solely on how involved the developers were and that I wanted something with shooting and tension. I must say if anyone is reading this and on the fence at all then go ahead and buy this game. It is far better than the videos make it seem and it has alot going for it. The damage is actually done for a reason and it works perfectly, as it creates tension and keeps you looking over your shoulders. Reloads are smooth and the two handed weapons are done in a way that I wish more dev's would take note, since they feel very under control and natural.\n\nAlso if you are reading this take note that they are not done with the game as more modes are coming out and there is alot of talk of multiplayer coming. And they have been keeping things free so far. The checkpoints are frequent enough which is smart, because while I've not had motion sickness from it yet I know others do and it means they don't have to push through to get to a safe place and if you have to turn it off you don't lose a ton of stuff or progress.\n\nTo the developers thank you for this title. It is the action I've been craving on the quest and doesn't cost as much as some very similar titles. I appreciate all the support you've shown for this game and the players, and I just wish I had picked it up earlier.\n\nHelpful | 10\nDeveloper ResponseJan 22 at 12:30 AM\n\nHey theshinymonk, Thank you very much for your comments.

We watched the video and looked at the difficulties that you faced. 1. Of course, the first red button in the reactor room must be pressed. Because of the fact that the event with pressing didnt work, the entire further logic was broken. There is every likelihood that there was a bug after your death. All events in the reactor room should have been cleared if they werent completed till the end. The first action  the lever (you have pressed it before you were killed by zombies with the crowbar). Then the first red button, and then the second red button (the one that shuts down the reactor completely). Our guys from QA are now examining your video in order to understand where did the error take place. In order to progress you need to come back to the menu and press Continue again, all events associated with presses should be cleared and everything should work correctly. I want to mention at once that the reactor room is the final room in this build, but well add one more chapter to the game in a little while. 2. Also, we noticed the problem associated with the fact that the weapon that was in the holster didnt reload and you had to take it out of the holster and reload again.

Now with that being, there are many missed chances that this game did in fact miss\n\nHere are a few recommendations that could be added to give a better, realistic and spine crawling atmosphere:\n\n-MELEE WEAPONS!! There are many missed chances to make things such as a combat knife, to a glass bottle into a weapon. It would help the player at least have a chance if they were to run out of ammo, as there were many times I had to simply run for it with the bare ammo I had, and felt there should be an alternative to help save ammo on stragglers and such.\n\n-Extra Save slots! Once I beat the game, I wanted to try out the other game modes, but simply hesitated as the game Informed me all my data would be reset. There should be another save slot to save your work if you wish to try and play on multiple difficulties without resetting my data from the previous Save.\n\n-Realistic Loading! I know Developers mentioned this will be added in a certain mode (that I cannot remember) but this will make the game more tense. I like the reloading on the pistols personally and the primaries (Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Vesper, Etc.) but I feel like it should be available as an OPTION for ALL difficulties. Some players may want the feature for the feel, rather than difficulty, meaning it should be added to all difficulties as a Settings option for players.\n\nThese are just my recommendations, but for any new players looking for a decent Zombie game, youre in luck! The Quest market is very limited, but this is one of the better games on it. I enjoyed the game and its pace and think the Developer(s) did amazing job on it!\n\nThe game is a bit short, but Im aware there is another chapter coming soon, but you should have a 4-6 hours experience with the game if you take time to enjoy the setting and atmosphere.\n\nAll and All, game is amazing, and thank you all for your time, if you made it to this point of the Review, and to the Devs, amazing job, Ill be back for the next chapter!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 7 at 8:48 AM\n\nHey Saxiestmanhere, Thank you for such a detailed review of our game!

Its very nice to hear that you liked the game. As to additional type of weapon reloading (more realistic, instead of arcade), we have already received such comments. Thats exactly why in one of the next update well add additional PRO mode in which the whole weapon reloading will be maximally realistic. In the closest update we are now working on there will be added new chapter, more weapons, new enemies. After that were going to release the update with multiplayer and then the next step will be the things such as additional modes and possibilities.", "mrhoopalotJan 20 at 3:49 PM\nImperfections shadowed by fun game play\n\nRight after finishing Arizona Sunshine, I purchased this one after reading good reviews.

I am looking forward to horde mode.\n\nFor developers -- ran into some jumpy graphics when trying to push the buttons on various keyboards throughout the game. Also, I had to exit the game and Google \"how to jump in Death Horizon: Reloaded on Quest\" because I couldn't figure out how to do it in the game.

This game gives you a bunch of hand thrown explosives that you need to shoot but they are disappointing. I was excited to find these initially except they do t really seem to hurt the zombies and only hurt you. One of the few decent chances you get to use them are when you open a room. However, you open the room, throw the explosives and the door closes. When you open it, the explosive can has vanished and the zombies are now all at the door.\n\n2. Questionable checkpoints. I spent quite some time on a very repetitive fight fighting zombie after zombie where one after the other they would just keep coming and I thought and hoped it would be over many times but, no, here comes another zombie from the sky.\nI finally finish that encounter to have to climb up some elevator shaft, while Im climbing I look around for where Im supposed to go - the quest controller loses tracking and I fall to my death - I come back before that huge encounter. The game had given me nothing worth playing through that encounter a second time for. That was it for me.\n\n3. No multiplayer, if the devs deliver on this it could be worth playing. This game would make a half decent casual multiplayer shooting game. But solo its not worth it.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 18 at 1:19 AM\n\nHey Virtua Yogi, Thank you for your detailed review! We understand that not everything is perfect in the game, all the more so as different players have different tastes and points of view as to how should it be. Starting from the game release in September last year, the whole our team keeps working on improvement of the game and we keep releasing the updates on a regular basis. For example, on the 9th of April there was the global update in which we added the new chapter, several new types of weapons and improved the graphics throughout the whole game. And as soon as on the 22nd of June there should be released the next major update with secret rooms, collectibles and achievements. At the present moment were working on the next major update  addition of co-op into the game. After it there are no less interesting updates on our roadmap - horde mode, melee weapons, new chapter. All these updates will be free of charge for already existing players  no in-app purchase or sales as DLC. Its important for us to provide all these updates without additional payment to the players who are supporting us at the stage of the game improvement. Regarding your questions: 1). Automatic doors closing. Doors open using an id card and close automatically when a player goes out of the door action zone. We cant leave all doors opened in view of the project performance optimization, but you as a player can try to avoid going out of the zone of doors closing trigger action. I.e. you opened the door  threw the balloon and shoot at zombies staying within a radius sufficient for leaving the doors opened. 2). Progress checkpoints. The idea itself to save players progress in the checkpoints is not new and it is applied in many other games. In each Save Room (this is how we call checkpoint spots) there are all the weapons that you found in the game, and if you face some problems with passing through some area in the game, you can try to change the tactics (e. g. take the shotgun instead of the rifle). There are literally several areas (2-3 throughout the whole game) where the distance between Save Rooms is not the same (due to this it may seem difficult to play through one section or another). In this case, you can always switch to easier difficulty (come back to the menu, switch the difficulty and click continue), play through this section to the next Save Room and switch the difficulty back to the previous level. 3). Multiplayer. As weve already written above, multiplayer is deep in development. The Co-op release is scheduled for Q3 2020. We have high hopes that this explanation will help you to reconsider your review in favor of the rating improvement. Also, may we remind you that the new cool update is very close  were aiming for the 22nd of June. We hope youll like it! Should you have any questions, you can always write us at info@dream-dev.com.

Reviews like yours help us to understand the most problematic places in the game and improve the product in the next update. Firstly, were glad that you spent more than 2 hours with the game. And, eventually you passed the game up to the end. Secondly, next month there will be released the game update with continuation thereof. In this update youll be able to meet someone you expected to see. Regarding weapon slots. Yes, there are 3 of them (so far). But you can change the weapon to another one in any save room. Regarding weapon losing. You shouldnt worry that something will be lost. Everything comes back to the belt after a while (about 7 sec). Regarding headshots. Depending on the type of weapon enemies can die even with 1 headshot. Lets take that same Desert eagle. It brings down almost anyone with 1 headshot. Regarding collision when climbing. We have two variants  not let you in the concrete/metal pipe (if you are climbing nearby) or let your avatar climb through it (it is not very realistic, is it?). A little addition: A). We really read all reviews that we come across and they are important to us. And we are grateful to you for this review. B). We always look for the ways to fix a lot of things from reviews and the things causing the greatest problems for players. For example, in the next update there will be improved climb mechanics. We will maximally reduce the situations when player can fall down when climbing. Also, weve already improved (and this will be available in the next update too) interaction with the belt. Now youll be able to put your weapon onto the belt in any zone, instead of just in a little slot. And a lot of other improvements as well. We have high hopes that youll find a minute and check the game again when the next update is released, with a view to, at least, meet someone you expected to see.

Its nice to hear that you liked our game but its a pity that you experienced motion sickness. Everyone has his own motion sickness threshold. But it occurs because of sudden and quick movements and discrepancy between the real body position and the things taking place in VR. In our case, for example, it is possible in the event of speed increase due to the turned on auto run mode. Actually, if auto run is turned on we can recommend to turn it off. Also, there is teleportation mode  there are no such effects in this mode.

Even enemies should drop small loot.\nRandom enemy count. there are vents and cracks to spawn zombies after every minute.\nmelee damage? making gun a physics object is but good and bad , bad mainly because the rifle and shotgun in particular interact with the walls unintentionally.

I have definitely run into some issues where my guns get stuck on doorways and I drop them so that's something that I would like to see fixed. The occlusion zones also seem a bit of,for example,I tried to reach out and touch a panel early in the game and it pushed my character away from the console before I even touched it like there was some invisible wall which honestly made me feel a bit ill. Overall though,my experience thus far has been positive. I would only suggest that one head shot with any gun should be enough to drop a zombie. 2 bullets with an AR seems a tad much. I would definitely buy the game as is because it does seem like a very active developer who is addressing many of\nthe concerns others have mentioned.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJan 17 at 1:02 AM\n\nHey Valentinevandal, Thank you for your comment. In the situation with occlusion we have two variants  to push you out and keep you away from entering the geometry (that the way were doing now) or to allow you to go through the objects. We chose the first variant to make it more realistic. Sometimes we see reviews in which people ask us to allow them to bend over the table, but technically we cant separate players head and his body. The only point which we can use to measure the players position its his headset, at that the headset height makes no matter. As to headshots  well revise the gameplay (the number of zombies and places of their appearance) in the next but one update. In this update well increase the number of zombies and decrease the number of their lives.

To start a most very scarce and if you run out and youre at some sort of boss level/checkpoint you cant get more ammo unless you spare your shots wisely. Please add more ammo at the checkpoints. Also I finished the whole game and the boss was pretty hard if you guys could add maybe a grenade to stun him or something that would be great. Dont get me wrong this is an amazing game with serious potential I am stunned by the graphics and have really been into the story lately, but it still has some things that kind of need to be fixed. Another problem is not enough space for guns you have three slots for guns two secondaries and one primary I think you guys should add another slot for a primary on your back so that you can reach over your shoulder.

Its a simple zombie game that doesnt over complicate things. And i love it for that. Dual wielding pistols is cool and feels awesome. Also the climbing DOES NOT make me wanna hurl. Its actually great! And killing zombies is very satisfying. 1 problem i had was with climbing. After climbing up from a ledge or dropping down to something below i often got stuck in the ground and had to grab something and lift myself up out of it. Often having to actually physically walk to the said thing. Another thing which is mainly an opinion is the vector. Its an smg so of course it uses pistol ammo. But it goes on the chest. So. If you do carry the vector you'll have 3 weapons using one single ammo type because the 2 weapons in your holsters can only use pistol ammo. So i had no reason to carry it despite enjoying firing it (to conserve ammo). But overall a pretty good game a definitely worth the money\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJan 3 at 11:33 AM\n\nHey levitranquil, Thank you for the detailed review. Yes, weve already had several reviews saying that a player sometimes is stuck during climbing. Most probably, well fix this in the next update (or well make such situations very rare). As to SMG  in the next update well add the new chapter, and itll feature additional weapons. And most probably, there will be something similar in characteristics to SMG, but at that, it wont take up the slot on the chest (and perfectly possible there will be 4 of them instead of 3).

Guns are pretty fun to use.\n3. Has some scares if your not paying attention\n4. Devs that actually update the game\n\nCons\nThe story isn't bad, though it's a little bland in some areas to me..sorry..for 20$ I atleast would like to have some extra modes or some cheats (infinite ammo/ no reload/ ) wink wink.. don't take this as a jab or anything. I believe it is a good title and I'm sure the devs are going to keep adding on.\n\n\nrecommendations\n\n1. The sprint should be the regular walk speed, atleast that's what I think. When the zombies go ragdoll it's kinda funny, wouldn't mind if that was permanent and the disappearing animation was dialed down a few seconds.\n\n2. Some extra story or maybe different modes.\n\n3. I think the character should have a head lamp., there were times I wanted to see a little more area lit up. Who knows maybe y'all can make some dark areas.\n\n4. Multiplayer would be pretty neat, especially if y'all do some kinda local coop. Like 1 person is on the headset and the other is playing on a phone, or just both people in vr ;)\n\n5.

Thank you devs for this awesome experience because Im quite new to the quest and I needed an action packed game to start off with and you guys delivered. Thank you. You guys should add a back strap melee weapons the ability for your gun to jam in high difficulty for the spiter like zombie you guys should change the model for it you guys should also make your guns have the ability to have their slide cocked back or just be cocked in general. And I have some ideas for the story if you guys want to know not that make an ending but that have introductions for new enemys and maybe notes and logs that describe said enemys and maybe that explain what happened over time.

One day I hope to be a dev like you guys. Also you should be able to push and punch enemys but you still can be scratched if you hold them to long and the punch shouldnt be too over powered and add bodys around that coralate to both the story and the notes that I talked about,for example, set up a scientist covered in blood with a gun next to him. Then you spot a note talking about why he ended his own life and other things around the room or at the door of the room such as a zombie trying to get in and people could most likely put to gether the pieces that he was scared to turn or what ever makes sense for the plot.

Locomotion movement is amazing, climbing feels really good, in playing on impossible right now and it's surprisingly challenging! Some of the zombies run so fast the movement alone is enough to make you flinch and I never get spooked in vr. I play with headphones and it is indeed the best experience.\n\nThe only thing that throws me off sometimes if the direction of shuffling footsteps. Sometimes I'm looking at the zombies the are causing the noise behind me. Probably just zombies in the room or floor above me so I'm not sure if that's really an issue.

Most zombies will stay on the floor you left them but in some rooms there are zombies that I'm assuming are scripted to jump off the ledge to meet you.\n\nAgain my review probably isn't that informative and I apologize if it's not that helpful to the community , just felt there are a lack of reviews in the Oculus store for these games.

I've been on the fence about it for some time but decided to take the gamble whilst it is on sale.\n\nI am extremely glad that I took the gamble.\n\nI'm currently about 1 hour into the game and have the following feedback;\n\nThe Good;\n\nThe scale of the environment, weapons, items and enemies are perfect, everything feels right which greatly aids immersion.\n\nThe gameplay feels tactical, if you are smart with your ammo and spend the time to investigate and loot the environment, you will survive.\n\nThe guns feel good, they are positioned comfortably so that aiming feels natural and you can use two hands to aim the rifle to steady your aim.\n\nThere's a nice variety to the enemies appearance which prevents you feeling like you are killing lots of the same zombie over and over.\n\nThe ambient sound is perfect and had me frequently double checking corners and looking over my shoulder.\n\nThe inventory system is intuitive, reaching to your chest or hips to access weapons feels natural.\n\nClimbing fits this title perfectly and is implemented well without being over used, I feel that the times so far where I have had to climb have made sense in the environment and added to the experience.\n\nZombies react to being shot which gives weight to your bullets and adds a level of strategy when it comes to keeping them away from you.\n\nThe Bad;\n\nSome of the faster enemies look like they might be using a sped up version of the normal walking cycle animation which is a little odd but hard to notice whilst you try to gun them down!\n\nI feel some of the normal looking zombies take too many headshots to kill given I'm on normal difficulty, but I don't know how else you'd raise the difficulty if all headshots were insta kills.\n\nThat's about it, over all I think the game is a steal for this price and doesn't warrant the bad press I've seen it getting from some users.

I am not new to vr and I had this title on the go(wasnt my favorite) , but the go has its limitations. With that being said I was hesitant to purchase this version for the quest. This game is 100 times better than the go version and so much more fun then Arizona plus the the graphics are ten times better , literally no comparison this should be your choice with an off the rail shooter and its half the price these guys did a good job on this game and they are coming out with updates and added content. My only gripes with this game which these sorta weakened the experience.\n1. Lack of ambience music and overall sounds , lets gets some rock music in there or something.\n2.being able to two hand hold a pistol\n3.manual reloading\n4.

Cool aspect when it came to climbing on your own very different. The zombies could be a little scarier looking but all in all its cool when you can keep different guns on your person.One down fall is that it can give extreme motion sickness maybe just me but i cant play for too long. Using the joysticks to move around kinda makes you feel like your first person in a call of duty kind of game which is cool. If you have a quest then its a must have when it comes to zombie games.I gave it a 4 star only because of the motion sickness side of things. but the game is a 5 so far.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseDec 19 at 4:48 AM\n\nHey Urchickshubby, Thank you for your comment.

I find death Horizon particular fun and come back time again. The devs are particularly responsive and continue to offer regular updates. I did my second play through after the Halloween update and now am playing a 3rd time with the Christmas update that just dropped. Always fun to see what changes and additions are added. I think what sets this apart is the envornment the devs have created. No music just sounds. Creepy sounds that have you checking behind you every few minutes and up heighten the senses. And the setting. Tight corridors with lots of potential zombie hiding places. Great stuff. And the added dread of heights. First time through this made me as nervous as the zombies, And horde mode and multiplayer are incoming.\nSo I'm happy to give this ONLY a 4 since how can I increase it otherwise when these other additions drop!?\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseDec 21 at 6:14 AM\n\nHey R_Steelman61, Thanks for your comment.

The big ones make her shout big mother funker over and over till she or it dies.\n\nWhen I play Im cool as a cucumber but thats me.\n\nObjectively reviewing this game is almost there. There are a couple of minor glitches such as the gun getting stuck on walls when you accidentally wack it against one. The solid wall feel and scraping sound (genius) is quite a cool feature. When your pistol and hand does get stuck it doesnt really subtract from game play.\n\nAlso the explosive canisters when you throw them through a door to blow the funkers to pieces seem to disappear when the door closes which is frustrating.\n\nAll in all, not quite 5 stars due to the glitches, but a great fun game.

Now we are working on new updates.", "captainchazDec 7 at 10:06 PM\nWonderfully Immersive & Scary!\n\nI purchased this game just now for three reasons, and I'm so happy that I did!\n\nFirst, because of the reviews. I'd been trying to decide between this game and Arizona Sunshine for a couple of days, comparing reviews. Most recent reviews of Death Horizon have been glowing; the most common criticism was the lack of free locomotion, which has been added. Yet a number of even the most positive reviews for Arizona Sunshine nevertheless acknowledge dated graphics and mechanics, which brings me to my next reason.\n\nSecond, Death Horizon as a game in itself. Right from the menu screen, I was quite surprised by the immersive sense of presence I got from its realistic graphics and subtle sound design. I was creeped out -- and that was before encountering any zombies, who are quite convincing and frightening. I also found the gameplay mechanics intuitive and enjoyable. Shooting just feels right, and climbing was a welcome addition. Death Horizon Reloaded may be a reworking of the earlier Gear/Go game, but this version fits right in with the Quest's strongest offerings. I thoroughly suspect all of this is thanks to the third reason I bought this game.\n\nFinally, because of the developers' obvious care for customer satisfaction. Dream Dev Studio seems to respond to almost every review, thanking the reviewers and sincerely interested in how their customers think the game might improve. They've also certainly priced the game reasonably at $20 and, from what I understand, intend to offer several updates for free -- a new location, new enemies, and a multiplayer horde mode. When customer service is this great, I feel compelled to support the developers and sing their praises.\n\nDeath Horizon Reloaded is a wonderfully immersive and scary zombie shooter by developers who obviously care about their customers' experience and satisfaction. If you enjoy the zombie genre and want to support the burgeoning Quest community, buying Death Horizon should be a no-brainer!\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseDec 8 at 10:49 PM\n\nHey captainchaz, Thank you very much for your comment.

It does let you pull a magazine out of your chest sometimes to reload the weapon but it doesn't always work. Improve your reloading system And I could see adding Another star. Also on the reactor level it requires you to jump and grab on to a broken bridge but that grab doesn't always work going on 50 times now and still can't grab it have to chalk this up to a glitch in the game.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJan 20 at 2:22 PM\n\nHey ralphgarcia614, Thank you for your review. 1. About weapon reloading. Currently, reloading in the game is in Arcade mode. In order to reload the gun or automatic rifle, you need just to put the weapon close to the belt. Shotgun also has the simplified reloading mechanism (you should hold it with one hand, and with another hand, you should reload it using the fore-end (Pump-action shotgun). But weve already received a number of reviews where players want to have realistic weapon reloading, thats why we decided to introduce the new PRO mode, in one of the next updates. In this mode the whole weapon reloading will be as in real life. 2. The jump mechanics is not necessary in the game. The only place in the game that you wont be able to go through without jumping is the tutorial box about jumping. As to all the rest of places, you can go through them by getting hooked on something around you and climbing through.

This game is fantastic. It takes me around 2 hours to complete on Normal difficulty but I have yet to try it on a harder difficulty setting.\n\nThere were a couple checkpoints that gave me trouble the first time through and took multiple tries. This is one of the longest games Ive played on the Quest, and one of the more challenging, so I really feel like I got my moneys worth and have no regrets buying it.\n\nPositives:\n1) Intense: Ive jumped multiple times, got chills, etc. Great experience.\n2) Weapons: Pistols, shotguns, ARs, etc. provide for a diverse killing experience.\n3) Strategy: This game makes you think, conserve ammo, etc.\n4) Zombies: There are multiple types to keep things interesting.\n5) Play time: As I said, this is one of the longest games Ive played on the Quest.\n6) Difficulty Levels: Various levels for various people.\n7) Movement Options: Teleport and locomotion to choose from.\n\nNegatives:\n1) No Melee Weapons: Id love to be able to carry a knife or something similar for when Im low on ammo, or at least be able to pistol whip zombies or smash their face in with my shotgun.\n3) No Other Game Modes: The campaign is great, but some type of multiplayer mode would be awesome (think CoD Zombies).\n4) Save Game Feature: It would be great to be able to save more than one game so I dont have to restart from the beginning every time I want to show a friend.\n\nAll in all, great game that Im glad I played (and will continue to play)! Keep up the awesome work. Cant wait to see what future updates hold!\n\nUPDATE: I have been absolutely stoked to play Arizona Sunshine, but was let down in a big way. I have found the overall gameplay and controls on Death Horizon far smoother and superior to AZ, so just wanted to say great job.

Could you, please, tell what game on Quest (not Rift) in this genre has better graphics? 2. Repeating gameplay. How long were you staying in the game? And what variety in gameplay do you expect from zombie shooter? 3. Headshot. Using the simplest type of weapon you can kill the enemies with 1-3 headshots (depending on their type). Using more powerful weapon (you can find it in the game in about 15 minutes)  basically with 1-2 shots. 4. Weapon reloading. There is arcade mode of weapon reloading in the game - you need just to put it close to the belt. A shotgun is reloaded in the same way as in real life. 5. The game you mention  it is a rail shooter. I.e. in fact its a shooting saloon without possibility to move and without any additional functionality. In our game, we dont limit a player and give freedom of movement.

It helps you avoid the nauseating moments when you reach forward while your character cant.\nThe item slots work very nicely. Better than other games that implement the same mechanic.\n\nThe bad:\nI (personally) dont feel the story if there is any. Please add a decent immersive story.\nShort campaign.\nThe game is too easy.\nIt has no horde mode for as far as i can tell.\nCant get ammo out of guns :/\n\nThe ugly:\nThere are a number of game breaking bugs i have encountered.\nI keep shifting through the railings. I lean or walk too far against them and i fall right through to my death.\nIt happened to me relatively often that my character loses his grip while climbing which is very annoying.\nI died due to losing grip and falling into the abyss. I revived at the checkpoint and my character kept jumping. after that he levitated to the ceiling. it took me about 30 seconds of smashing buttons to get things back to normal.\nAt the reactor, there was a spot where i could reach to another plateu (climbing) and i ended up about halfway on the plateu. I guess the game didnt like that because my character slowely rose out of the floor and when he was free he made a giant leap into the air and i drop dead... again -_-\nI dont mind dying in games but dying due to glitches infuriates me.\n\nOther than the bugs that really need fixing, the game is good. Way too easy but good. I haven't tried easy or normal. I started on hard and the zombies are bullet sponges. It takes about 4-5 headshots to kill most zombies. It's not a game breaking issue but i rather had zombies dying from 1 or 2 headshot and have hordes of them coming from all directions. That would be a better experience.\nI still recommend the game because it is a good game.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseDec 8 at 10:35 PM\n\nHey bi7je, Thank you for the detailed review.

Though there are some flaws I hope the developer does indeed fix on. The weapon HUD though neat can easily get in the way of traversing the environment. Which results into the next major issue. Its the climbing. Yes the main feature technically. It is used a lot. At times its not bad and you can easily get around. Sometimes it can be frustrating. Due to the guns being holstered you can accidentally grab onto a handgun or your rifle/shotgun/smg and it can easily get annoying trying to get around. Sometimes you can lose your grip. And the checkmarks are through segments where you usually obtain the weapons. I feel I see that place more often than that. The zombies don't even kill me much. Its me losing my grip on getting through. The jumping is a bit \"meh\". It makes you jump a Luigi jump but its not very useful on zombie fights and only there to add \"mechanics\" on the climbing segments. The ammo is very scarce and at times your just running around and away from the zombies. Its usually at the parts where there are pukers. I am not sure if there are unlimited waves during those pukers but it feels long and I run out of ammo too fast. its only luck I find ammo. But regarding the pukers and the climbing segment, there is an annoying moment. When you first obtain the SMG, you kind of have to leave the area and \"partially\" backtrack. There is a moment where you climbing and you have pukers. Not only do pukers really damage you but you also have to climb at the same time. Not fun. I have died way too much on that part. It kind of made me a break on it unfortunate. Which is a shame because the shooting mechanics are really accurate. I like the smooth moving option but I wish the camera was as smooth and not only jerky with a sharp turn. With that said, its a fun game. I think with the flaws regardless, you will have a great time.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseNov 26 at 1:00 AM\n\nHey Halo44327, Thank you for the detailed review.

Im assuming that will get fixed though.\n\nHelpful | 9\nDeveloper ResponseNov 6 at 2:33 AM\n\nHey clwnbby420, Thanks for your review. Its very nice to hear that you liked the game. Starting from the previous update, there are two types of movement in the game - locomotion, and teleport. Some reviews are quite old and they were written as far back as when there wasnt a new type of movement  locomotion  in the game. So, now everything should be OK with this matter :) . Concerning the speed of the players movement  it changes depending on the thing you have in your hands. If a player has nothing in the hands  he moves quite quickly if there is just one gun  a bit slower, if a shot-gun  the slowest. We keep track of players reactions and should it appear that its necessary to speed up the movement of a player when he has a shotgun in the hands  well definitely do this in one of the next updates.", "ghostrider31Apr 12 at 11:03 AM\nGreat\n\nI love this game it is realistic and I was like jump scared but other than that is is amazing!!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseApr 13 at 1:10 AM\n\nHi ghostrider31, Thank you for your comment.

Makes clearing each room feel good. Guns are great and run smooth. The shotgun could be better. Sometime it wouldnt rack a round, Causing me to just toss it aside. The zombies are great. But their spawns feel lame. When they were just laying about and eating corpses, it made it look and feel better, Not empty rooms then they come in from nowhere. (Have some hidden like behind desks or alot more around corners or crawlers)\n\nReally hoping for realistic gun reloads. Being overrun and having to reload manually can REALLY make it intense. Being able to take the mag out of a random gun would be better the carrying till it empty and tossing it. Also the guns \"faze\" thru zombies. It would feel amazing to be able to barrel punch or hold zombies agaisnt a wall with the barrel before killing them. Even tripping them with a tossed gun. Lastly on weapons, The throwable canister feels to heavy to throw. Impossible to get in between a group and use it effectively. Maybe replace with grenades?\n\nA survival mode would definitely help the replay value of the game. Could definitely be a great addition to play for hours on end.\n\nOverall wonderful game.

This wasn't a massive issue and just lead to a couple of checkpoint resets.\nThe enemies come from all around you as you make your way through the facility they seem to be triggered to spawn when you are in vulnerable positions giving a good challenge and use of the smooth locomotion to run around firing at will.\nThere is a variety of guns to play with also and my only gripe was the pump action shotgun failed to load once and wouldn't pump although being fair, its not my go to weapon in any game.\nThere is plenty of play time to be had here and I had a great time playing this title.

Should you decide to play the game again and if you like it, well appreciate the change of your review and rating. Thanks! --- Hey clyde.hunt.92, Thank you for your comment. We are really sorry that you faced difficulties during playing our game. The mechanics of jump in the game is an additional option and it is required only in one moment - where the room with the jump tutorial appears and there is the need to jump onto the boxes. You can complete the room with the destroyed bridge simply by jumping to the lower platform, and then from the lower platform move to the other side (and then climb up the pipe). We filmed a short instruction for you with a jump video. We really hope that this will help you to figure it out. In fact, there is nothing difficult. Depending on the type of movement you select (walk or teleport), the mechanics of the jump is different. If you play in walk mode, you jump in the direction where you are going (standard mechanics for console / pc game). If you play in teleportation mode, when you press (and hold) the button, the jump mode will turn on. Keeping the button pressed you need to move the controller in space, and with the movement of the controller, there will appear the arc along which the player will jump. I.e. you will visually see the point where the player jumps to after you release the button.

Some took 4 Desert Eagle shots to the head. Still the best handgun though,... out of a choice between that and a handgun.\n- Dogs. Great enemies, shame they die with 2 basic handgun shots anywhere.\n- Ironsights, have to tilt controller down to the ground to look down them. Carpal Tunnel inducing.\n- Utility belt. You can stick 2 handguns in holsters and a heavy gun across the middle, also attach keycard to the belt. Good idea, until you try to pick up anything by the ground and pull out your keycard instead. Utility belt reloads the guns for you though.\n- No proximity pickup for ammo, have to use a hand to teleport it to you.\n- Disappearing guns. Had a Desert Eagle in both holsters, after a checkpoint they were handguns again. Cheers.\n- Only 4 heavy guns, all basically longer louder versions of Desert Eagle. Headshots still not guaranteed\n- Two-handing of heavy guns, have to dislocate your shoulder to use the iron sights and when you line them up there's a red laser dot there anyway. Unimmersive\n- Climbing. Randomly drops you, or glitch throws you across the room.

You need to press one button and (depending on the type of movement - \"walk\" or \"teleportation\") to tilt the left joystick in the direction of the jump (walk mode) or hold the button and to point with the controller where to jump  here the indicator that has appeared will help you (teleportation mode).

Its that right amount of scary that keeps you immersed. I say again, KEEPS you immersed! Other games can be fun, but this is beyond worth the buy. Additionally, the developers care. They have listened to us gamers and made adjustments/updates based on what we wanted. Not all developers do that. That itself makes it worth it to invest into this company.

Nevertheless, enjoy all zombie and horror fans!\n---------\n\nNew Rating 28.10.19\n\nThanks for being so quick on the motion control review.

However an autosave or even a manual save option per room would be really nice. If i need to jump out of the game, Im thrown back many rooms and thats just an unpleasant experience. Also the floor is a good few cms upper than it would need to be, while my guardian is set well. Still this game should be an instant buy for every quest owner, i hope that smooth locomotion is coming very soon as i personally hate teleportation, completely breaks the immersion for me.

This is the type of game that could greatly benefit from a random/procedurally generated Rogue Like mode that pits you with seeing how far you can make it with maybe some sort of currency and vendor to buy guns, ammo and health from in between sections.

First of all if you haven't got this yet and you love zombie/horror type games you won't regret your purchase. Definitely the most fun I've had with a shooter on quest. Alrighty devs, your rival Arizona Sunshine, another zombie/horror shooter coming to the quest this year will definitely take to shine. I absolutely love Death horizon, you've done a fantastic job with this game so I really hope to see more from you all in the future and really hope the updates will keep people interested and playing even with the release of a popular upcoming title. You said there's a new update coming so just wanted to mention a few things I've heard people talking about and my own suggestions to help keep your game being supported by old and new players.\n\n1. Soundtrack. Honestly the silence is okay to me, just hearing anonymous sounds is kinda creepy and gives a good horror vibe in my opinion. I think it would be nice though to certain parts (SPOILER) like the first dog encounter or long climbing parts to make it more intense along with the large hallway towards the end to keep the action from going dull.\n\n2. (Manual reloading) Quick reloading by just moving it up and down to your belt helps a lot so being able to reload yourself will make it more immersive and intense during swarm situations.\n\n3. Multiplayer/or co-op horde mode. Campaign is fun but once it's done it's done, only thing keeping me coming back is Nightmare difficulty to go for top score as it's nice achieving something and that's what people want. Hopefully you'll add more like this for the online mode.\n\n4. Challenges/mutators. My own suggestion, either set mission challenges or the ability to set modifiers that make the game far more challenging for the experianced zombie slayers. Stuff like double zombie speed, less ammo pick ups or fun ones like big head mode that either give you more or less score depending on the challenge. Maybe reward the player for score or completion of these with something like a weapon skin?\n\n5. Props. I can't pick up that coffee mug and throw at a zombie's head? Sad face.\n\nThose are my top 5 suggestions. Even if one of these things are possible then awesome! ^^\n\n(Updated)\n\n1st placement, I did it!! Nix0327 I think we just became rivals, or really great zombie killing partners in the future haha. If you want the best score you have to use the starting pistol. Points are based of hits and headshot kills. Weakest guns means more points on hit but if you want the biggest bonus you need to finish them with a headshot. Hope this helps everyone! I still need to experiment with the shotgun. Mutiple shells to the head, bigger points??? I actually died when I got top score by the way, didn't know it counted but thank goodness it did because I almost threw my controller. I looked down at the floor in disappointment with myself for like a minute as I got super cocky at the end by walking up to a big zombie spraying at his head, managed to hit me and as I was stunned it actually got me haha I should've stayed back. I might of got wayyy more score if I got to the end. Still happy though. Halloween update is a blast. Didn't expect those scares, nice job devs! :D\n\nHelpful | 6\nDeveloper ResponseOct 31 at 7:15 AM\n\nHey BluecoSilverscales, Thank you very much for very your detailed comments! Yes, thats right, we keep working on the game improvement and addition of new content. 1. Music. Were working on addition of music to the game. That will be optionally with the possibility to turn it off. 2. Manual reloading will complicate the gameplay. But considering that we get many reviews with such request we are going to make a special mode with completely manual (and realistic) weapon reloading. And to remake the gameplay specifically for this mode. 3. Multiplayer mode is under development and itll definitely be available. 4. Challenges/mutators. Its more difficult task on which were, in some sort, working as well. We understand (absolutely honestly) that it doesnt really make sense to complete the game over again. Thats why were going to add achievements, maybe optional spin-offs or tasks. 5. Props. The initial idea was to make it possible for you to interact with any object. But within the scope of optimization, we limited ourselves to just a small set. The thing youre talking about (grab the cup and throw it at the zombie) overall is possible and I think that well implement this in later updates (after addition of new scenes and multiplayer).

I wouldnt buy the game until smooth locomotion was added. But, post launch the dev added the option. Also, free post launch Halloween content was added (fun stuff).\n\nGame play is good. Though it can be a little formulaic in its loop. Move through an area, shoot zombies and find new key cards.\n\nThe story (with voice acting) is there, so I have appreciate it, though it is a little uninspired.

It really is like being inside an old-school FPS. The climbing mechanic is spot-on, I love being able to swing and jump accross platforms, I love the design of the levels and the baddies, it's all great.\n\nThe only problem is, this game is too short. I finished it in half a week - I've had more playtime out of free demonstrations. Are there plans to release more levels in future updates? Multiplayer? Maybe even a level design tool? I feel kind of ripped off by how short this was even though I *loved* the game and everything about it. I enjoyed the Daydream version as well and I can see how much progress they've made with the guns and the game mechanics - so why have they done so little with it?\n\nIt's like the devs had a fantastic idea for a game that would keep people playing for months on end, built a fascinating and addictive framework for a game, but lost interest and decided not to bother building more than a few levels for it and just knocked out a demo instead.

With shotgun such situation really happens sometimes and it is to a greater extent associated with the fact that there takes place a great displacement of one of the hands in the real space (in the game the hands are attached to the points on the weapon). To revert the shotgun to its normal condition, just release one of the hands and take it again. At our end, well try to minimize this issue in the next updates. 2. Concerning appearance of zombies. Do you mean that they appear right before your eyes (this happens once in a rare while) or dont you like how they come out of holes (fall from the ceiling)? We would appreciate some example or video.

You currently have to teleport everywhere and Im not a huge fan of this movement style. Also the AR, Vector, and shotgun are way off when holding controllers. The front controller has to be dropped down in order to align sights on them. This makes using a gunstock not very immersive. Maybe a gun adjustment would be helpful for this. The throwing of objects isnt very good ether. You can pick up these canisters that explode when shot or when zombies walk close to them and you cant throw them very far. So this makes it interesting when you throw it and have to teleport away and try to shoot it really quickly. Over all this game is pretty fun though and if the devs can fix these things Id rate it 5/5 easy.\n\nUpdate. Smooth locomotion is now in game. Much better than teleport.

This game, with a good pair of headphones, makes you feel like you're there.\n\nThe gameplay is a riot. Takes a few headshots to put the zombies down, so you better have good aim, and a quick trigger finger. The teleportation issue is being fixed soon, so i won't drudge on about it.

The climbing sequences are enjoyable as well.\n\nAnd THANK YOU for supporting teleportation. If people want locomotion, then by all means, include as an option.

But teleportation is more immersive for others like myself. We enjoy actually walking around within our guardian space and augmenting that with teleport. Magically floating along when our legs are stationary is immersion breaking to many of us.\n\nSome suggestions to devs:\n\nEnhance teleportation to be similar to Robo Recall (stick initiates the aiming arc, then tilting the stick allows you to set your direction upon arrival)\n\nPerhaps slightly increase the distance that the teleport is capable of.\n\nConsider allowing weapons to clip through walls and structures (when the weapon is held) Things get fiddly when Im trying to open lockers and the weapon is hanging up on things.\n\nPlease implement additional save slots.

When I saw it on Quest I thought I'd give it another go. It looked fun enough and perhaps more realistic than the fantastic but \"cartoony\" Drop Dead. Unfortunately, after half an hour I was extremely bored. And despite persisting through the awkward control schema I was ready to call it quits after an hour. Neat climbing action which I don't think would have been on the Gear VR version but it does little to drag this game into the realms of enjoyability. It's the same thing over and over with little variation. Oh, wait... look... Zombie dogs! An unexpected surprise but again, too little to improve the game. Constant short range teleportation further drags the action down. Visuals seem to have made no use of the Quest hardware. And the jump mechanism is simply ridiculous!

I was torn between this and a few titles of a similar concept and Im really happy I went Death Horizon: Reloaded.\n\nThe teleportation vs. locomotion works well. You can teleport and physically turn to escape danger and continue the attack.\n\nThe weapons are fun and interactive.\n\nPlaying this games puts me back to playing the old House of the Dead arcade cabinets.\n\nIn terms of updates Id like to see better height recognition / better belt placement. The ability to hold both the shotgun and rifle. A melee mode, could be knife / machete or bare hands but just some form of defense when out of ammo. More weapon choices, auto shotgun for example.\n\nThank you for the developers for an immersive game that works amazingly on the Quest platform.\n\nHelpful | 6\nDeveloper ResponseOct 9 at 5:52 AM\n\nHey SaviorOneZero, Thank you for your comment.

The shooting is accurate when aiming which is important for people who actually know how to shoot. The only thing I would like to see fixed or improved is when I try to grab a magazine to reload I often grab the keycard by accident and the magazine is really far to the right so sometimes it is hard to grab. Maybe there can be a second magazine on the left side of the keycard too.\n\nHelpful | 6\nDeveloper ResponseOct 9 at 5:51 AM\n\nHey LastActionHer0, Thanks for your comment.

It should fix this situation.", "DickDastardlyOct 20 at 7:17 PM\nA tense zombie shooter\n\nAlthough the game got off to a bit of a rocky start due to launching with no movement options other than teleportation, I have to give props to the devs for very quickly responding to community feedback and adding joystick locomotion. This has transformed the experience from something akin to looking at a series of disconnected snapshots of a zombie apocalypse to a tense and atmospheric shooter.\n\nGraphics aren't bad at all and performance is solid, with excellent animations and dingy, spooky environments brought further to life by sinister 3D sound effects (although the distant groans can get a little repetitive sometimes). There are also several points in the game where the untethered nature of the Quest really shines as zombies are approaching from multiple directions and you need to constantly be aware of what might be behind you. I almost jumped out of my skin a couple of times when I turned round to find a zombie right next to me about to lunge.\n\nThe weapons work well and are fun to shoot (particularly if using a gun stock). Reloading, however, is fairly arcadey and is done by simply lowering your gun to its holster, although I gather the devs are also looking into adding a \"professional\" mode with full manual reloading which should ramp up the tension considerably when you're fumbling to reload before the zombies get you.\n\nFinally, the game has some cool little climbing sections which break up the shooting nicely (and add an extra dimension of fear for those who dislike heights)\n\nOverall then a fun, atmospheric zombie shooter (if currently a little short at around the two hour mark). However, with additional maps, a horde mode and multiplayer on the way this is well worth picking up if you're looking for something less cartoony and more \"realistic\" than Drop Dead.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 14 at 9:56 AM\n\nUPD 14 May 2020: Hey DickDastardly, Thank you for your review and suggestions  we appreciate them. We are releasing regular game updates based on the feedback from our players, so any ideas as to the game improvement are very helpful for us. Just short comments concerning some of the things you mentioned in your review are as follows. 1. Climbing. We have already fixed the climbing bug in one of the previous updates. Please, make sure that you play the latest game version. 2. Horde mode and multiplayer. Well add co-op and horde mode a little later  in the next but one update. The nearest update (it will be available in a few weeks) will have secret rooms, collectibles, and achievements. 3. Reloading. Were working on making weapon reloading more realistic and well add a separate mode into the game with manual reloading as soon as we finish it  in one of the future updates.

Before I jump into it, shout out to the responsive devs replying to not only my previous review but others' as well. Now then, let's begin! The virtual hands and interaction with the world and objects felt pretty smooth and natural, even during the climbing sections. So far only teleporting is your means of movement (devs are looking into this). Nothing like dangling off something with one arm and getting headshots with the other! The weapons and recoil felt nice to handle. Reloading is more the traditional arcade style, place your firearm near its holster and you're good to go! I, myself, love immersion but I'm glad this style was chosen (although an immersive option would be nice, wink wink). You won't be busy fumbling around with your guns or mags trying to reload while you're being swarmed, which kept the combat pretty fluid. The variety was ok and felt progressive, when you found something new it felt rewarding. I didn't find myself using an smg much due to it taking from the same ammo pool as my pistols. If you ran out of ammo for your smg, your pistols were essentially null too in this situation. The shotgun felt a little clunky at times. Under pressure or on random occasion it refused to fully \"pull\" back, it might just have been my experience. Every other firearm felt great and all of them felt different from one another. Definitely try them all out at least once! The variety of zombies was just right for this game, nothing too crazy and just enough spice to keep it flavorful. The amount of zombies you encounter seem a little scarce but this was played on easy mode. I'm sure higher difficulties fill this in or provide enough challenge to compensate. The story, for those who care, seems like it's got something going and the team have something up their sleeves. I won't say more on the story, you're going to have to play it and enjoy it for yourself. Time crunch; Overall, I'm glad with my purchase and I'm glad to support the team behind it.

We just wanted to shortly comment on some points of your review. As to teleporting, we have released a number of the updates and now there are two movement options in the game  teleporting and free locomotion. As to the shotgun being clunky sometimes, we fixed this. Also, in the latest update we added the new chapter, fight with the Boss and made some improvements/fixes.

Were revising the jumping mechanics and well simplify it in the nearest updates. There are several ways to complete the scene you wrote about in your comment.

Hopefully, this information will help you to progress.

The idea behind it is sound enough; go from area to area (finding different colour key cards - like the original Doom) and battle zombies as you go. Pick up ammo, new guns and search the lockers, pick up explosive stuff and that's pretty much it.\n\nThe problem with the game is the movement. You use a teleport system and whilst some people moan about this, I have zero issues with it. At least, when it works correctly. This is not as precise as it needs to be. For example, go to teleport and it doesn't work properly. Hit the buttons a bit harder and eventually you move. It's frustrating but not a game-breaker and I am sure they could update it to make it a little more smooth in the future?\n\nGraphically it does the job. It's not the best but to be honest, with VR, for me it is more about the game play. Yes, the zombies all look a like with only a few different \"skins\" and they sound the same and pretty much move the same (so far) but, so what? It's still fun putting a bullet in them.\n\nWhat I do like is the guns. I'm three levels in and have so far played with a rifle, a shotgun, a handgun and a desert eagle. The latter is good for one shot headshot kills, the rifle is great for precision firing thanks to the laser sighting and the shotgun Is just good for carnage. When you use one gun, and then switch to another, it does actually feel like you're using a gun with a different power to it and that's nice.\n\nAnother nice touch is the climbing aspect in the game. You can climb broken structures, ladders, ropes and it feels responsive to do so and isn't done in many other games so, again, it feels new.\n\nIs this a worthwhile purchase? If like me you have had your Quest just sitting around waiting for something new to play - I would say it's worth grabbing.\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper ResponseMay 13 at 10:33 AM\n\nUPD 12 May 2020: Hi mattshaw, Thank you for your detailed review.

The only two issues I have with it is using teleportation for movement (luckily, they're actually working on making smoother movement, which is a big plus), and height adjustment. My sister is really short and when she plays the game she can't reach the belt and pull a pistol outta the holster which is a real big problem considering the game is based around gunplay.

Theres a part of the game that requires you to jump a gap and on the 3rd attempt I switched it off, the crappy jumping thing is not something that enriches the game, just allow the teleport to get you there rather than the jump. although I wont be looking to refund as I think especially with multiplayer it will be decent.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseOct 18 at 6:15 PM\n\nUPD: A new update with an additional improvements jump mechanic is already available for download.

This game is very decent but it suffers from very poor mechanics and decisions from the developers . Let me address what it got wrong first in the hope that the developers will update it.\n\nTHE CONS:\n\n1-The lack of settings customization is very annoying. Can I adjust the belt please? Mine is almost under my armpits and I'm 6'. This makes reloading and resting your guns a chore. The holsters are somewhat clunky, I lost my guns so many time thinking I've holstered it but in fact it's laying down somewhere in another room. And also, if I drop a gun on the floor, don't make it disappear so quickly, that's not how reality works.\n\n2-The locomotion is highly appreciated but far from smooth. There's always that feeling that you're dragging a boulder while walking. While running if you can call it running its like walking while limping. Holding down the thumbstick down for running is a good intention but in reality it feels awkward. Can I get an autorun setting please? I feel that when you're shooting you're walking/running slower, that's very annoying.\n\n3- This is a very poor decision from the developers to make you shoot a regular zombie point blank in the forehead 3 times with a Desert Eagle before it goes down. I understand that they wanted to add tension and probably drag the game time longer instead of more levels but this is not how the zombie universe works. If you shoot a run-of-the-mill zombie in the head once it dies, period.\n\n4- The door/keycard system is just frustrating. The door close 3 seconds after you opened it. It's not long enough for most zombies to get out, they kept getting crushed my the door. I spent as much time messing around with keycards in that game than actual playing. Make it a toggle switch.\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n1-Nice graphics for a Quest game. Nothing annoyed me visually. It's a good looking game considering its playing on some 2018 phone hardware. The zombies are well designed and they move well. The maps are very decent and you pretty much feel you're there.\n\n2-The shooting is pretty precise and challenging in a good way. Good stuff.\n\n3-Even if this game is clunky af, suffers from bad implementations, and needs customization options badly, it still is a decent game that is payable and challenging.\n\nI hope this review helped you decide if you want to get it or not. I hope th makers are listening and make this game great. I'm willing to revise my review if they fix stuff I mentioned.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseMay 17 at 10:08 AM\n\nUpdate 17 May 2020: Hi CarcPazu, Thank you for your detailed review. From the moment you wrote it, the game has been updated a number of times and if you check the latest game version (0.9.12), maybe youll like it more because it has a lot of improvements and fixes ads compared with the version you commented on. We added option section, autorun, improved interaction with the vest. We also improved the graphics in the game in the latest update. We also added the new chapter (the game is longer now), new types of weapon and other cool content. We keep working on the game and well be releasing more new updates, so there are many great things to come in the future. Hopefully, youll check the game again, and should you liked it now, well appreciate if you change your review and rating. Thanks. Regards, Dream Dev Studio. --- Hey CarcPazu, Thank you for the detailed review. We keep developing and improving the game, and comments like this help us to understand which difficulties different people encounter. 1. The option of flexible customization will be available in one of the nearest updates . There youll be able to choose the height level of the holster, turn ON/OFF the autorun, choose the type of movement (by the camera or hand) and a number of other settings. At this moment the position of the holster adapts to your height. In order to solve such issue it is often helpful to readjust the position in Oculus Quest itself. I.e. closed the game, adjustment of the position of the floor and space around you, and restarted the game. Concerning weapon coming back to the holster. We think that weapon should come back to the holster. Otherwise players will be losing it and this will cause a lot of problems. 2. The movement speed changes depending on the thing you have in your hands. If you have no weapon in your hands, the movement is quite fast. You dont need to hold the stick pressed in order to run. Its enough to press it once and then just to move it. And as Ive already written above  well add the autorun option to the settings. 3. Headshots. In Normal mode of difficulty, using the weapon Desert Eagle, if you hit the head, then 50-60% of zombies will be killed with one shot, and 30-40% with 2-3 shots and you need more shots only to kill fat guys (this is caused by their body weight). 4. Door opening. Door is opened using the card and it is closed if there is no player within a certain radius. While a player is near the open door it shouldnt close. Maybe, you move back straight after you open the door and in this situation  yes, it closes (this is how its meant to be). I hope that I managed to clarify the situation a little.

Multiplayer would be nice but glitches are priority to make playable. Sometimes when climbing you fall for no reason while still holding the grip button. I noticed this glitch fairly quickly and carefully watch when climbing for a good grip but it still happens somtimes costing me my D eagle. The AR15 in the safe room before you walk on the balcony of 85th floor glitches sometimes. It did this on a livestream to facebook and made your game look poor despite my best efforts to show it off. Finally after the room where you find the vector on 85F you walk onto another balcony with several zombies spitting acid at you. At this point when you aim AR or vector from over or between the railing the bullets hit the railing even though they shouldnt. The guns both struggle going above this railing as well. Nearly all videos of gameplay online end at this point due to death from this glitch or falling after killing them. Everyone struggles here. To make things worse i used the range of these zombies to test your are 15 at a slight distance and if i line the sights up it misses forcing you to rely on laser sight which nobody would use at that range as it move over the target quickly from minimal movement. In real life you wouldnt rely on it from that distance anyway, you would use the sights.

Problems with climbing sometimes may be caused by loss of tracking on controllers (i.e. we lose the controller  there occurs an abruption and a player falls). This often happens when there is lack of light (its very dark) or when the light falls within the cameras (e.g. when youre playing in the sunlight). We understand that this shouldnt be of players concern, thats why were considering a possibility to refine Climb mode with due regard for such situations. As for weapon behavior.

It's is better now, as before it was at a fixed rotation that was incorrect, but the solution is not much better. What the developer has done, is offset the rotation of the gun according the the controller rotation every time the gun is picked up. This means the gun can have different rotations every time you pick it up and always feel off. You have to stop playing, look down and line your hand up with the gun before you pick it up. Any other game would simply offset the gun to line up to the real world reference rotation of the controller. Why would you change the rotation of the players virtual hand from thier real hand? If I held a gun in real life, it would conform to the rotation of my hand, not an arbitrary offset. In vr the rotation of my hand is represented by the rotation of the controller.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 14 at 9:41 AM\n\nUPD 14 May 2020: Hi Ecto-1, Thank you for your review!

There are just too many bad game play mechanics in one game for it to be fun. From opening doors with keys(is this the 90's?) to a pump shotgun that's so glitchy it's useless. It's also very hard to see where your shots are going so it's impossible to correct your aim and the weapons feel weak because the zombies are sponges. So it takes forever to kill anything. Every room has like a dozen or more lockers to search for ammo and when you find it you have to get close enough and point at it to pick it up. Again, very tedious and it detracts from the gameplay. An FPS should be fast paced and flowing. This feels like a chore to play. The climbing is also a mechanic I could do without. It never feels natural in VR and it's way too easy to fall in this game. That wouldn't be so bad except the checkpoints are so far apart that I end up just quitting because I don't want to have to play through those last ten minutes again. What ten minutes? Doesn't matter and that's the point. There haven't been ten minutes anywhere in this game is want to play again. The graphics and sound are pretty mediocre too. The blood splatters and muzzle flashes are particularly ugly as are the animations.\nI could live with the mediocre art but the gameplay is too much of a chore to be fun.

They are much better than any zombie shooters out on the quest marketplace.\n\nThe weapons feel like they have their places and the weapon damage shifts seems well thought out.\n\nHOWEVER remove the parts of the experience that rely heavily on climbing just to go to another area. It was interesting at first, but the imperfect nature of grabbing the pipe cause many falls. The climbing honestly was so frustrating I didnt play the game for a solid week.\n\nMaking climbing a part is a good idea, but the current execution makes the game insanely frustrating.\n\n\nThe pistol, shotgun, and rifles all have the incorrect/awkward angle to the aim. Sometimes the rifle looks like youre pulling a Tony Montana. Iron sights on the rifle are not useful. However the pistols iron sights work wonderfully.\n\n\nNo multiplayer/additional wave modes is another draw back. But I understand that is coming in an update according to devs.\n\nI will reevaluate my rating after the update.\n\nP.s. a reloading mechanism that requires actually loading a magazine and cocking the action would be incredible.\n\nEdit: devs replied, and I dont think I was clear, the climbing is not in any way something that makes this game more enjoyable.

Problems with climbing sometimes may be caused by loss of tracking on controllers (i.e. we lose the controller  there occurs an abruption and a player falls). This often happens when there is lack of light or when the light falls within the cameras (e.g. when youre playing in the sunlight). We understand that this shouldnt be of players concern, thats why were considering a possibility to refine Climb mode with due regard for such situations.

Its got the atmosphere down, the voice acting is ok, and the classic arsenal of guns is here. The gunplay is surprisingly smooth although the shotgun can be confusing. Ammo is pretty hard to come by, especially shotgun ammo. Although not all weapons are made equal. Some are strong but waste ammo and others are well rounded. Id say the Deagle and shotgun are the best. The weapon models are too dark to tell apart for the pistols though unless closely inspected. The checkpoints are well dispersed for the most part but sometimes take too long to come. The climbing is simple as well, and you may be surprised by what you can climb. Gore effects are good too. One of my biggest grips is that the game has the same setting for the whole campaign, which I havent beaten. I hear its short (1-2 hours) and I feel like Im almost there. If this game had a horde and co-op mode, it would compliment the short campaign very well. Smooth locomotion is coming too, so look out for that.

No point in aiming, hence only 3 points.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 13 at 11:08 AM\n\nUPD 12 May 2020: Hey aCe369, Thank you for your review! Since you wrote your comment the game has been updated for several times and maybe now (with new types of weapon and improvements/fixes) it would be more fun for you to play.
