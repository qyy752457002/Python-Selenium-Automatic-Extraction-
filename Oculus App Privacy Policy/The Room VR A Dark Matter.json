I am new to VR and am a bit of a wuss and paranoid about things jumping out at me and being scared etc. There is none of that in this game but some very imaginatively creepy visual effects that simply blow your mind. It really felt like I had been transported to several fantastic imaginary worlds and I got to experience places and I never thought Id see! Almost like being in a fantasy film - the best game yet and I so want more...found it very difficult to leave this virtual world and didnt want it to end - very engaging. Dont hesitate to buy it is worth it!\n\nHelpful | 42", "OculusQuirkJun 3 at 12:55 PM\nA great family experience\n\nPlayed with my 14 yr old daughter and 12 yr old son taking turns and making suggestions. An excellent and great fun puzzling experience. We absolutely loved it. The attention to detail is magical, the puzzles the right kind of difficult and it looks spectacular, most especially the miniaturisation parts. Wonderful stuff.\n\nHelpful | 144", "Kreon-Rekon21 days ago\nA Masterpice of Storytelling and Puzzle\n\nI was introduced to the The Room franchise years ago and instantly fell in love with it. In my eyes Fireproof games has created one of the most immersive experiences ever since. And I gotta say: The Room as a mobile App Version was already nice... BUT HOLY MACARONI THIS STUDIO DOES NEVER FAIL TO SURPRISE ME.\nWhen The Room Vr: A Dark Matter released I didnt even think twice getting it. In fact this game (and FNAF: Help wanted) were the reason I even got me the Oculus Quest in the first place!!\n\nBut aight now I gotta stop fanboying for a bit and just get to the game itself. If youre into puzzling, creepy atmospheres and myths this game is the go to!\n\nNot just are the puzzles challenging and fun to solve but the effects in this game just take you away. You immerse yourself fully into the story and if youre familiar with the previous games it is just astonishing to see all the events of the past add up to the situation you find yourself in. I even shed a tear at the end cause I just found it so epic!\n\nYoull be going through 4 main levels in this game that each tell their own individual story. Every level comes with its own individual and familiar mechanisms that challenge you and your mind to progress through this surreal world. Youll be shrunken, small things get big and vice versa. Its a bit as if youre Alice in wonderland. Tho this world is far more mesmerising and amazing I can assure you!\n\nOne little thing I noticed is that it felt like the levels were a bit easier than what I was used to from the mobile app. However, Fireproof equals that out with a unique and wonderful story telling and amazing atmospheres.\n\nThis game is worth every cent and I just cannot Stress enough how it is a MUST HAVE for your Oculus library!! You wont regret it!\n\nSo what are you even waiting for??? Get this game now, seriously?!\n\nAnd Fireproof games: Please keep up your amazing work! You guys are the absolute best!!!! <3\n\nHelpful | 5", "hexadrine4 hours ago\nI need another game from Fireproof ASAP\n\nMy partner really enjoyed Fireproof's mobile games and bought this initially for himself to play before suggesting it to me. This is one of the best mobile experiences I've ever had - the puzzles were involved and quite tricky some of the time, and the world was engaging and beautiful. I'll be grabbing anything else Fireproof puts on Oculus, so hopefully I don't have to wait too long.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Connacemox11 hours ago\nMasterpiece\n\nI sincerely hope games like this one becoming more and more common. Amazing storyline, music and graphics. I was fully immersed and invested in it.\n\nI loved all of the chapters with my favorite being the Cottage and everything after it until the end. I had no problem solving the puzzles on every chapter, except the Village, the one in the church. I had to look up how to solve some of it and had me quite confused in some parts, so it is the only one I liked the least.\n\nAll in all, a big thank you to the developers and I hope there are more games like this to come.\n\n5/5\n\nHelpful | 0", "Winter.Wolf21A day ago\nPerfect VR experience\n\nWhether youre new to VR or not, this is a must try VR game. Similar to Red Matter (another puzzle room game) but much much better. Id give the graphics a 4/5, overall very impressive environments with great use of colors and animations , sounds (I recommend playing with headphones as there is a lot of creepy noises and whispers) 4/5 only because there isnt much dialogue, storyline 3/5 it was fun to see where each discovery took you but there wasnt much of an actual storyline that made you want to know what happens next, puzzles 5/5 they were fun, creative and some took me a bit of thinking and trial and error to figure out. (well done to the developers on that)\nOverall Id give it a 5/5 because of how well done it is In all the major categories that make for a great VR experience. Creepy, fun, and rewarding. Would love to see more of these kinds of games. If you read this far, just buy it already.\n\nHelpful | 1", "trishypooMay 31 at 7:54 PM\nBest puzzle adventure game ever\n\nI've been playing non violent adventure puzzle games on pc for 30 years.starting roughly with iconic myst etc. I was hoping to encounter a great game like this in the vr world and I am so happy to discover and play this. Great graphics. Immersive play. Great story. Puzzles are hard enough and thanks for the clues I dont have to cheat. I hope more and similar come out. This is the best game I've ever played in my life.\n\nHelpful | 51", "DreamCatcher073 days ago\nAtmospheric and wonderful.\n\nI have The Room series on my IPad and was excited to see it come out on VR. I was totally immersed in the environments which were eerie but beautiful. The puzzles are challenging but not too hard and l love the hint option. I hope that they bring out more of this series in VR (Hint, hint, Fireproof Games). Good job Developers!! \n\nHelpful | 0", "naveh43 days ago\nGiddy\n\nI was giddy the first time I entered a VR headset at a business. It was a year before I got my quest but my family mentally logged how exciting it was for me...how it truly felt like another world where looking down from heights made you nervous. This is the first game Ive played that made me smile and shake my head in awe like that. It was so clever, and beautifully crafted and each stage was unique and memorable. I look forward to their next offering. This is what its all about. Its a must experience in my correct opinion.\n\nHelpful | 0", "BaconManMan4 days ago\nAmazing Puzzle Solver!\n\nIn all honesty, I was a little skeptical of it from the first look. I didnt know if it was worth the 30+ bucks. But it was. This is a amazing game, with the world and puzzles being unique as interesting. I had so much fun with each level, and felt so satisfied when i pieced puzzles together! Probably one of the best sit-and-play mysterys on VR! The only problem I have was that there werent more levels to have fun with!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Virtual-Life5 days ago\nWait for a patch\n\nVR has come a long way on controls so why is there snap turn only with blinking? That implementation was used in older VR titles yet we have it in this game with no option to turn it off. I can live with snap turn but the blinking is very annoying. Wait for a patch that allows for an option to disable blinking and hopefully allow smooth turning.\n\nThey fixed snap turn to remove blink so I've increased stars.\n\nHelpful | 1", "rickc8910 days ago\nAmazing game\n\nI have played every game in the series, from the mobile phone games to this. This game is excellent and would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games / escape rooms. Only criticism is that I completed it too quickly (played it non stop) and wish there was another for me to work on.\n\nHelpful | 2", "abe.kleinfeldA day ago\nFantastic!\n\nI wish it went on forever. This game is so well done and engaging that youll lose all sense of time playing it. And I love that it uses teleportation as I always get motion sickness in games that dont have it. Bravo to the developers and creatives that worked on this!\n\nHelpful | 1", "batch2k17 days ago\nThis genre is perfect for this hardware!\n\nEscape rooms in VR!? Best idea ever! The Room VR was creepy but not scary. Really enjoyed the Egyptian theme and the Templar. Didn't care for the witch stuff. Hope you will make more games in this series for this platform but would like to see you stay away from that particular theme. Very immersive. Couldn't out it down. The miniaturization was really cool!\n\nHelpful | 0", "CasualJayy6 days ago\nLove this game\n\nI personally have always loved puzzle games. This is sort of like an escape room. I love when I figure something out and that provides the answer to 3 other things that Ive been stuck on forever. Can be frustrating at times but feels that much better when you do finally figure things out. I find it very rewarding and not too difficult, just need to think outside the box\n\nHelpful | 1", "FiascoTheAcidBike8 days ago\nAwesome Escape Room!\n\nI got this game in quarantine because I missed going to escape rooms and The Room did not disappoint! There are some really unique puzzles and challenges in this game that youll never see in a real escape room. Plus, it was nice to be able to set it aside and come back to it with fresh enthusiasm when I got stuck.\n\nI was a bit worried about being spooked too, but it isnt a horror game, so no worries there!\n\nNow that Im finished playing, Im excited to have my friends try it! I hope to see more content from the creators!\n\nHelpful | 1", "tom.weaver.3114Jun 4 at 7:33 AM\nUnbelievably good\n\nBest experience I have had in VR, and most immersive game I have ever played. Showed me what VR is capable of, particularly being able to miniaturise to solve puzzles inside artefacts like clocks and pipe organs and have experiences that are therefore impossible in real life. It lasted me several weeks and I was super sad when it was finished. I will buy every one of these that Fireproof make. Incredible.\n\nHelpful | 29", "trig9993 days ago\namazing game\n\ngreat game from start to finish great detail throughout . brilliant puzzles to work on to progress through the rooms\nonly down side could have been a bit more hard and longer cant wait to try out the new one if they make a sequel but all in all great game thank you\n\nHelpful | 0", "Durpy1310 days ago\nOne of the best titles on the Quest\n\nAs a long-time fan of the mobile games of the series, I was both exhilarated and nervous for the release.

How to put this though... so you make me into a detective in the 1800s, cool. But then within minutes of arriving, Im seeing fantasy vines coming out of a keyhole!? Forget everything else, I almost left the room for multiple scientific opinions on that alone. Ease into it in future games. I really wanted to dig into the man-made secrets of that apartment more before being taken from it. In the end, enjoyed it a lot. Some puzzles were too simple to be thought of as puzzles but there was a range of interesting things so Ill accept the mundane in the overall experience. I look forward to more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Bubblyart59Jun 18 at 11:09 PM\nAwesome experience!\n\nMy son surprised me with a VR headset for my birthday. This is one of the first games I purchased, having never played on any platform before and what can I say... it was an awesome first experience. The graphics are beautiful in every minute detail. The puzzles are challenging but the useful tips prevent this from becoming frustrating. I did find certain spaces a bit uncomfortable but found ways to minimise that.\n\nI loved this so much I could not put the headset down and I have since purchased the previous rooms on my tablet.

I.e, \"Congrats on your 3 hour bust of the puzzle. Now, here's another puzzle to solve!\" But Room is very strategically paced like Red Matter.

Fireproof Games did a wonderful job creating the perfect atmosphere for each area, using just the right mood music, sounds, and tactile force feedback. You hear and feel the levers clank as you turn a handle, or the rumble of a heavy stone door as it drags open across the floor.

That excitement was rewarded by an experience that fully matches the quality of the mobile games. The gameplay and story are very consistent with the mobile games, and the puzzles are as fun as ever to solve. The main difference is how much more fun it is for the puzzles to be literally life-sized, and the interactions to utilize more than your fingertips. The full game felt shorter than the mobile games, but I think the trade-off is worth it.\n\nHelpful | 1", "SpookyQQ2 days ago\nThe Room Dark Matter\n\nOMG this is one of the best games I have ever played!

But it has too many quirks to justify the current price of $30.\n\nFirst, you cannot walk freely around the level. You are trapped in a small area and have to teleport to different areas. The walking apace is so restrictive that it makes it difficult to reposition yourself. Second, there are a number of quirks that break the realism. For example, if you pick up a piece of paper and then drop it the paper will snap back to its starting position. In most games this would be nice but in VR it doesn't make sense.\n\nOverall the game is enjoyably. If they better adapted it to the Quest and dropped the price then it would be worthwhile.

All of the stellar reviews pushed me over the edge to buy it but I had a lot if doubts.\n\nIt ended up being pretty much what I expected it to be but done so well that it quickly won me over. Some of the best visuals on Quest, some truly brilliant player interactions with objects and how they connect to the puzzles and the environments and a great overall mood and pacing make it a real pleasure to play through and a bummer when it ends.\n\nTBH I didnt know what the hell was happening in the story and I'm still not positive now that it's over, but I was always engaged and eager to see what was next. One of the Quests finest experiences.\n\nHelpful | 0", "gax64Jun 17 at 7:58 PM\nDetective in 1908 England - Wow!\n\nFinishing with the British flag waving on the balcony, made me smile.

I love the way Fireproof designed puzzles, love the storytelling since The Room 3, love the attentions to detail, etc. The one thing that keeps this from being perfect, yet still deserving of 5 stars, is the lack of object interaction. Namely, manipulating the items in your inventory or hands to change them in one way or another. I'd like more puzzles like unlocking the orb in the Museum. Those just add a level of interaction that has been present since the beginning yet is very much lacking here. Thank you, Fireproof, for putting this amazing series in VR.\n\nP.S.

The other issue was that the story wasnt easy to follow. I finished the game without a clue what it was all about.

And by that I mean impossible without clues. Sure, a good 85% you can do sans clues, but it's one of those puzzlers that'll have you completely stumped for days, WEEKS, only to finally pull a clue and find out it was something you couldn't in a million years have figured out all on your own.\n\nI guess developers have to come up with a way for players to not simply breeze through a $25 game in 2 hours, but the way to that VR Holy Grail of longer (please! Longer!) game play shouldn't have to be via making it literally impossible without a clue.\n\nNot that your time spent clicking down the Clue Click is for naught. What developers have instead focused on is extremely rich design. You are literally inside the organ in an ancient Masonic temple at one point, in a dusty museum the next - and the artustic rendering is fantastic. The use of the magical spyglass to \"see\" spirits or floating crystals is visionary and exciting. The Art Direction and *background narrative - the story that weaves the world and the puzzle together - is well concieved and gorgeously designed.\n\nIt seems lacking in the puzzle part is all. Imagine joining a scavenger hunt, but your list of items required to complete it are dollled out, one by one, on a timer. The puzzle is indeed complex in a Rube Goldbergian way. The path through should be less of a laborious chore and more of an intellectual delight.\n\nA few more encounters with a spirit, voices, a narrator, a flashback here and there to a scene that reminds who we are investigating and why could go a long way. A string narrative thread throught gets lost in the minutia of the tedious moment.\n\nAll that and I am clearly a fan. I've come back to The Room repeatedly over rhe last few weeks, sometimes several times a week, for another go.

(The hint system reminds me of the system used in the old Infocom text adventures.)\n\nThe interaction with objects feels great. Once Quest's hand tracking leaves the experimental stage I hope this game is updated to use it.\n\nMovement is teleportation only, but it makes sense within the context of the puzzles.\n\nI binged on this game until my face hurt. :D\n\nMy only complaint is that I wish you could disable turning with the controllers. I prefer to turn simply by turning my body. When teleporting with the joystick it's easy to accidentally trigger the click turning.\n\nThe Quest is really on a roll this past month. Lies Beneath, Down the Rabbit Hole, and The Room are all top quality games.\n\nHelpful | 2", "SupesMay 3 at 12:32 PM\nPerfect transition form phone to VR\n\nI've been a big fan of The Room series on mobile and I've always wondered what it would be like to play these games in VR.\nWhen I saw this pop up on the Oculus store it was an instant buy and without question one of the best VR experiences I've had to date.\nSimple controls, puzzles that are challenging (but don't make the game frustrating), and a serious sense of immersion few other games get right.\nA massive part of that immersion is the atmosphere the game builds using the music/sounds, lighting, level (set?) design, and small details they focused on (for example, swinging your fire-starter from side to side fast enough will extinguish the flame).\nI cannot recommend this game enough to lovers of puzzles/escape rooms, it's also good enough for me to recommend to those who don't traditionally enjoy a slower paced game such as this.\n\nThanks Fireproof :)\n\nHelpful | 0", "dannyjk360May 2 at 5:19 PM\nEscape room on steroids\n\nAmazing immersive experience. Lots of puzzles with varying degrees of difficulty. I really like the way they incorporated hints. If you get stuck, I got stuck a couple of times, first they give you a little hint.

There was a lot of original ideas in this game, and you can tell they also spend a great deal on the atmosphere, creating a slightly scary design without really going to far.\nMost riddles make perfect sense and seem logical.\nI only needed two hints, one in the second room that actually helped me to learn how the game was thinking, and I would not have needed any other tips if it wasn't for a small bug in the 4th room. In the end I had to log out and in for it to work. This was the only time I had this though so it was probably a glitch.\nI do think its possible to finish this with no hints at all, so I advise you to try not to request any, you will feel much better after.\n\nHow it would get even better?

This is done in such a way that you might be nervous every corner you take. It's really good though and I'm still not ok with taking a heart out of a corpse but ya know as long as I don't have to do that again for a little while. The ending was really well done as well and the puzzles were great. Not so much as a hold your hand and walk you threw it but not extremely difficult either. For anyone whos played The Legend of Zelda these puzzles were about as challenging as either Twilight Princess or Wind Walker. The gameplay is a bit different from Zelda but about the closest thing I've found so far to it puzzle wise. For those who love puzzles this game is for you unless you can't handle creepy stuff then in that case it's not. Also there are hints for if you are stuck and some people may need them but some may not. The story is excellent but there's not much of a backstory though there doesn't really have to be. Voice acting would be good but there wasn't any. My favorite thing about this is each puzzle is different and there are so many varieties that you need to keep thinking. It's not like some things where it's just hide n seek to find a key and then need to unlock a box to get another key and so on.

It reminds me of Red Matter. It is nothing short of incredible that they managed such high level graphics on such a headset.\nThe puzzles are of medium difficulty. Nothing as frustrating as Riven or The Longest Journey (rubber ducky anyone?), but really accessible to all. And it is difficult to get stuck, which is great. Some of the game mechanics are amazing (such as entering a lock), and really fun to play with!\nThe environments are gorgeous. I didn't expect such variety in the environments, and they were all very rewarding. I particularly enjoyed the church environment and its locks game mechanism. I spent several minutes just looking at crystals spinning around me.\nIf anything, the story is the weak point. I have no idea exactly what happened. I may simply need to play the other Room games to understand? But even without understanding the full story, the atmosphere is expertly built.\nThe game is quite short (maybe 4 hours or so?) but worth it. Of course, it doesn't begin to equal things like Obduction in terms of content, but as a standalone puzzle game, it is great.

Gameplay is super smooth and very easy to play with minimum amount of space. The new mechanic of teleporting to a smaller perspective inside the objects was a really cool way to enhance the gameplay. The puzzles were challenging and satisfying to complete.\nOne small feedback - the final level was too easy/not challenging at all and felt like it was just there to tie up the story. Only cool part was the animation (spoiler!  ) with the kraken-like creature (  end of spoiler ).

But at the same time, never felt frustrated, stuck or tired in anyway. Which is probably an ok balance for a VR game. It has a different feel than a lot of VR games, it seems there is no physics, with freedom to do or go wherever you want. Instead it's kinda just like the popular 2D apps.

Each puzzle and area has it's own feel to it. Puzzles aren't too difficult but can be quite challenging at times and cause you to think outside (or inside) the box.

I wouldn't count the police station or the Egyptian tomb at the end as levels. The puzzles are definitely good and can be challenging at times. A lot of oculus Quest games are too short. But most of them are not $30. One of the issues with games like this is there is no replayability. There's no fun in replaying a game when you know all the answers. The graphics and detail in the levels are very good, especially for a quest game. I think at least two more levels would make it worth the price.

The puzzles are all so well thought out and clever, and I felt an overwhelming sense of accomplishment when I figured one out. My husband had to use some of the hints and I like how if you use a hint, the game makes you wait to get another one. It basically forces the player to keep looking around and trying, and hopefully they figure it out for themselves. It also utilizes the teleport system of movement which was a little trying at times (I would push the stick forward and would be too far to the left or right so I would turn instead), but I understand why they chose it. It's more comfortable for most players, it echoes the gameplay of the mobile games, and it probably made it easier to focus on making the areas you are able to explore that much more detailed and amazing.\n\nI think the only downside is that I finished it in a few days and I just wanted more!

In a game about mystery, the biggest mystery for me is what variety of arcane magic they used to get graphics like this on the Quest. And I'm not just talking about texture resolutions and polygon counts etc. It's also the artistry with which it's all been put together - the design of the artifacts, the animations. This is the best looking game on the Quest in my opinion (even better than Red Matter). It's also atmospheric, engaging and full of lovingly-crafted touches. Buy this game, it's worth every penny.\n\nNow, having made it clear that I absolutely love this game, I'm going to talk about one area where I feel it could have been better: the difficulty level. It's far too easy. While many of the puzzle devices you interact with are elaborate in their design, the solutions are typically very straightforward. Often you're presented with a complex array of switches, dials, sliders etc. and you think it's going to be a real head-scratcher, but then you notice that the solution is inscribed right next to the puzzle. In several cases, I managed to unlock these intricate-looking puzzle boxes just by blindly poking and prodding at different parts. I wasn't even trying to unlock them at this point, I was just playing with the moveable parts to get a sense of what kind of puzzle I was dealing with. And then the puzzle just solved itself. In many cases there are somewhat cryptic clues in the environment, but you don't really need to find the clues because cycling through all the possible combinations takes mere seconds. And in case anyone's wondering, I played with the \"hints\" option turned off from the start. (It's amazing to me that this opinion is even available, given how much hand-holding the game does anyway). To be fair, there were one or two hard puzzles per chapter, and I really appreciate the thought that went into them. Getting stuck for a while and then finally cracking these puzzles was very satisfying. But overall the A-to-B nature of the problem-solving was disappointing. This game could easily be twice as long and twice as enjoyable if it had more true puzzles and fewer \"put the X-shaped thing in the X-shaped slot\" type moments.\n\nStill, it's an amazing experience. Can't wait for the next one.\n\nHelpful | 1", "evandaganMar 31 at 9:01 PM\nStep inside the puzzle box...\n\nAs a fan of The Room games, I was thrilled to see this coming to the Quest, and it does not disappoint. The puzzles of the mobile games are literally expanded to room scale here, without losing any of the complexities that make the series so fun and challenging, such as the multi-stage solutions that require the use of certain objects or mechanisms in a specific sequence, use of an eyepiece to reveal different \"layers\" of gameplay, etc. The intricate design of the series' puzzle boxes extends here to the whole environment, with great textures and visual effects that make the most of the Quest's limitations. If you're looking for a challenging spatial puzzle game, this is it: a close second behind Shadow Point for this type of game on Quest.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's that the locomotion is kind of annoying: teleportation is fine as a mechanic in general, but here it often orients you in the totally wrong direction, and it can be really disorienting. I get why the devs would want to avoid free locomotion, but I wish the teleportation was more consistent. It would also be nice to have an option to use a different button mapping for teleport (not the thumb stick) so you don't accidentally hit snap-turn when trying to teleport. A small complaint, and overall this is a great game and I hope to see more in this series in the future!\n\nHelpful | 0", "andy.m.loganApr 1 at 1:31 PM\nMyst-esque puzzle game\n\nI was hesitant at first but ultimately really enjoyed this game.

Theres a simple storyline and ultimately a satisfying resolution once youve worked your way through the four levels/environments. The game is an escape room style puzzle game.

Fantastic VR.\n\nI've enjoyed Fireproof Games' Room series on an iPad, but this new adventure into VR is stunning. Been a few months since there was a must have Oculus Quest title. Room VR breaks through. The puzzles are cinematic. The rooms are a welcomed break for those of us currently sheltering at home. And how the developers use the VR space is genius. Fireproof always had the lens in the Room series that magically alters your size, but experiencing this in VR is way more dramatic. Another nice feature is Room VR has three player slots. This way you and your family can take turns solving puzzles and playing through levels more collectively. You can't all play at the same time, but you can be more in \"virtual sync\" this way.

Once I got used to that I realized it's still mostly the same. Being inside the game is a little spooky, just like the original except I'm expecting a monster to come at ... But it hasn't yet. This game also adds a NEW dimension, literally, to the puzzles which adds a new feel to the game which I enjoy. Also, I was worried about locomotion since original games had very limited ways to move to keep it from being overwhelming, I think they did a good job of being true to the original but also giving limited freedom of movement so you're still partially immersed.

I mean I wasn't expecting puzzles and escape room style games to be this fun and interesting, I was sucked in by the whole concept of this game.

Took me awhile to finish some puzzles they range from easy to hard, I found myself taking breaks from the game like I do normally to rest eyes, but continuously still thinking how to solve the puzzle. This is how a game earns 5 stars, I put it down and I'm still involved into the game. There is a clue helper for you if you just cant figure it out, I had to use it twice unfortunately. But with how long the game is and how many puzzles, I think that's pretty good...lol.

If you like Red Matter, then you'll like this game as well. The puzzles are entertaining and well fitted in the game. The only downside of this game is that you can teleport yourself only to fixed locations. That makes it sometimes too easy to solve a puzzle as you know \"there must be someting here\". When you can move around freely (either via free locomotion or teleporting) finding the puzzles is also part of the game. Especially if you make fully use of 6DOF. (e.g. that you have to squat to look under a table, in a low cupboard, etc.) That's what makes Red Matter just a little better than this one. But still I like the game. It's got a decent length for a VR game. I know that on other (2D) platforms there are various episodes of The Room. It would be awesome if the developers also create more VR episodes of The Room. I will definitely buy them all.

I know. With that said, the previous 4 non-VR \"The Room\" games sold on the iOS store for 5.99 (or less on sale). Yes, they were non VR titles. This 5th (?) entry into the series is on par with those games but aside from the VR aspect of it, that's exactly what it is - on par. Definitely playable, but I don't know if $29.99 is a fair asking price for a game that isn't very replayable and is only a few hours long. Especially when you compare to what this would cost on iOS. I give the game itself 5 stars, the excessive price point knocks it down a star. Not enough bang for you buck. In addition, smooth turning and locomotion (like others are saying) would make it much more immersive. Otherwise it seems more like The Room 360 instead of fully VR.\n\nHelpful | 4", "ScottRyanRealtorApr 11 at 5:34 PM\nAmazing hunt\n\nI loved how much I had to think and figure out!

It provides some great puzzle solving, fantastic spooky atmosphere that would genuinely creeped me out a little at times, and compelling visuals and environments. My only problem with the game is that It feels just a bit short, like I could probably get a refund for this game from Oculus if I wanted because of how little time it took (which I won't do because I really liked the game and want to support the developers) And there are a couple reasons why the game ended up being so short. First I feel a lot of the puzzles in this game are a bit too easy. It's often possible and simply easier to just guess and go through all possible combinations on certain coded gateways to progression in the story, and often I'd solve something on accident just cause I toyed around with it for a second, this on top of a lot of puzzles just seeming very guided and having obvious answers. Of course a lot of other puzzles I enjoyed greatly, that I won't explain due to spoilers. Second, I feel like the ending of the game after the 3 only real sections of the game (which were all great) really has some lost potential. You skip through a large interesting environment which ends up basically just being a long hallway towards the finish, where your next step is always extremely obvious. I wished after the rest of the game that the ending would be a culmination of the rest, and the hardest challenge yet, and it was a bit of a let down how quick it took to beat. Even the little pattern puzzles they place at the end of the game are explicitly easier than the ones in the chapter before, ultimately making the game feel like it sags a little at the end. Overall I loved the potential this game showed and I would love to see the next game from these guys, or even a hard mode to this one that boosts the difficulty of all the puzzles and would allow for a 2nd playthrough.\n\nHelpful | 0", "alan.trulyApr 29 at 4:35 PM\nvery good and beautiful puzzler\n\natmospheric and well made, puzzles are good and the hints when needed are subtle, but helpful\n\nHelpful | 0", "ron7136Apr 6 at 5:46 PM\nGreat\n\nAbout 3/4 of the way though and loving it!

The puzzles were challenging and even had me going for the hint system a couple of times near the end. The graphics were superb and the mechanics really showcased the immersion that VR can bring. I only have two negatives. The first was that the environments while detailed weren't very interactable outside of the puzzles. Other VR games have made me expecting semi sandbox environments to explore. The second was that the game was a tad short. While the game includes 4 rooms, the first is more of a tutorial. It could have done with one more room.

Then the \"puzzles\" take single-digit seconds to solve, or aren't puzzles at all just busywork (turn a handle, pull a lever, etc). Some puzzles are so simple you solve them by accident. A number of them need to be repeated. So I found the gameplay tedious and annoying and the fantasy plot just isn't for me though your mileage may vary on that.\n\nBut, I'm giving it four stars for the same reason I eventually played it all they way through: This is a remarkable technical achievement and looks *beautiful* for a Quest game.

That said it has 3 HUGE points to make it much better:\n1. Googles lenses: please open the inventory to activate them and not hiding inventory after activation is LAME. A gesture to activate them near your headset is a must have... can't foresee a reason for you to keep it in the inventory.\n2. Locomotion: at some points where the scenarios are meant to be scary and ominious, blink teletransportation is a no-go... you go, probably the worst is the templar catacombs... an amazing ending for the chapter where not moving down thru the spider webs and teleporting instead kills the whole atmosphere. I know it is hard to fix at this point and adding free locomotion with \"clue\" hotspots is a no go, but at least a walking transition between points instead of blink teleport... that can really summ up to the experience.\n3.

Or buy 3 games of 9,99 and have a lot more \"playtime\".

Beautiful environment. That's really a great job from the devs.\n\nBut there is point that I don't really understand. The dev should let the player wander freely in the environments. The different rooms have a great atmosphere and a lot of details. You really want to be able to just walk to the different point of interest, circle around the tables or boxes... things like that.\nBut the only option is to teleport to the different location. Then, once you are at a location, if you move a couple of steps away, you have a black screen with a message telling you to go back to the game area... That completely breaks the immersion.\nYou did an amazing job guys! Just let the players walk, with their feet or joysticks, and enjoy the beauty of your game if they want to. And keep the teleport to precise places of interest,but that could be activated with a trigger, or the right joystick. You can just have all of these systems at the same time, and let the players decide how they want to approach the game. I bought the quest to be able to walk. To be immersed. And your approach feels like the game was mainly developed for the Rift.\nWithout spoiling, during the last chapter, I feel I would have walked all along, instead of teleporting all that scenery. Just walk, enjoy the scenery and feel the tension growing as you approach the end.\n\nJust correct that and I will replay the whole game. And put 5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 1", "RobMcFlyApr 2 at 1:23 PM\nAbsolut perfect\n\nOne of the most impressive games ever. Thanks to the team!

It has some really great moments of discovery. I especially loved the church organ. So fricken clever through and through. Some minor issues I had with the game is the way the game mechanics from mobile version translated to VR. I played it sitting down which was nice. But I would've enjoyed being able to walk around the environments more instead of being forced to remain in a very tight window of space without teleporting. I think they missed an opportunity to allow players to truly explore. Otherwise it was a fun experience and I will def buy the next installment and eagerly look fwd to seeing what new puzzles they have in store.

The Quest casting is still in beta and it crashes each and every time, about 45 seconds into game play. Ive gotten colleagues to play the mobile game with their spouses but I couldnt recommend this one for couples. It doesnt feel like free game play where I can walk around at will; youre essentially guided to where the clues and puzzles are because there are only so many places to which to teleport. With the mobile app, we would often spend/waste a lot of (fun!) time looking in cupboards or places that had nothing to do with anything.

Its a VR point and click game and while i did enjoy my experience, point and click isnt really what vr is meant for. yeah it made sense in the flash days and was fairly nostalgic of those times but with this kind of technology it just feels limiting, especially given how streamlined the later levels become when theres only so many places to check for objects and puzzles. This game could seriously benefit from both a movement option and a more VR esque physics style like what we have in Red Matter. actually being able to navigate and look in every corner and being able to interact with things that werent necesarily important was huge for immersion (bc the faster the player moves through the levels, the less time theyll spend learning about the world, by the end of Red Matter i felt like i had a good grasp on the story and really understood how story elements were connected) and added a small amount of difficulty.\n\nHelpful | 0", "MrNarwhal30Jun 25 at 6:45 PM\nAmazing\n\nLoved the mobile game loved this too\n\nHelpful | 0", "AelektoMay 28 at 6:17 PM\nGreat addition to Room series\n\nIf you like this series you wont be able to put this one down.

The puzzles were exceptional and I felt very immersed in the worlds. I have only taken one point away as the hands did not always follow the tracking of my controllers which took me out at times. However it never reduced the ability to actually play the game.\n\nGraphics: 10/10. Wow! I must admit when I bought my Quest headset recently I was a little concerned that all the games I would be able to get would look Wii-Quality. Sure, the quality of a game isn't all about graphics. But I'm gonna factor it into my review anyway  The graphics of this game surpass anything I've seen on the Quest and that certainly increases the immersion. Top notch graphics work \n\nAudio: 10/10. Very immersive. Unsettling at times - mainly due to how realistic it is and how much it brings you into the world.

Great puzzles and controls and great story to boot. I cant recommend this game enough. My only request to the developers would be to allow freedom of movement for those with the room to do so, I 100% can see why the choice was made to contain the player from a design stand point and it serves the game well its just that the game is so beautiful I want to explore this world.

An official The Room game in VR. My expectations were high and the game has met all of them. All of them. I am consistantly and repeatedly mindblown by this game.

I miss the more involved boxes which I understand may not fit VR controls as much.\nBut that is not a complaint at all, as a first attempt at VR for the series it is truly a success!\n\nAlso as mentioned on other reviews, the experience compared to the previous titles in the series is much shorter than I thought. Took around 4 hours to complete, I would have liked to see just one more puzzle scenario so I can state it is worth the full price for ALL VR users, but saying that the devopers deserve all the profit they get from this as it is still a masterclass in puzzle design brought to VR!

The series progressed, from a box in one room to various rooms and later an entire mansion with portals to other locations, and now they've finally made the jump into VR, and Fireproof has excelled in every way as they play with their winning formula. Numerous callbacks and connections to previous games are sure to please longtime fans like myself all the while providing ingenious puzzles that, like the original and its sequels on mobile, takes advantage of the VR platform to great success.

Bought this the day it came out. Very happy to keep supporting the devs.\n\nHelpful | 0", "KaspizauslApr 4 at 1:28 PM\nGreat game\n\nAbsolutely brilliant.

Most amazing sun puzzles introduced after a new form of eye glass heck yea. But then they turned into 2 steps and then none. Right there at that moment when you saw the deadline of when you had to make this game that moment is when. Such nice rooms. I expected so much from Egypt. He's waiting at the temple. Its time for the drama. And its as simple as pick up and place for the last bit. I've followed you from room 1 on phone not allowed in beta but hey life happens. Every ending large. Left you wanting more. This ending answered the question that we knew since one. And an served right after the first box is dropped. I'm not gonna say cause spoilers. don't think I didn't noticed the 2.3 gigs download but then need files access for unzipping.... But remember have fun and make the game that YOU want to play and don't listen to the opinions of people who are going to say anything bad. Because I bet you..... They probably can't see.\nUPDATE: I had a dream last night the third puzzle was and all around you 360 but you had to teleport to the center of that room.\n\nHelpful | 1", "DrDon1Mar 27 at 9:41 AM\nAwsome\n\nKeep it up fireproof but its a little short for the price\n\nHelpful | 0", "atirathaMar 28 at 2:03 AM\nLoving it, few small remarks\n\nIt is The Room, just like we remember from our phones. Much more immersive in VR. However, given the pricing of previous installments on phones, I feel 30 USD is somewhat excessive for pretty much the same length as all the phone games. One baffling design overlook. When jumping between the points, you nevee face where you were going, making it a bit jarring to have to take your bearings every time you jump.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ReptileMkApr 4 at 10:15 AM\nExceptional\n\nExceptional\n\nHelpful | 0", "halfrojake87Mar 30 at 5:03 AM\nAwesome Game!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game!\n\nHelpful | 0", "WildWolf360Mar 27 at 3:14 AM\nImmersive\n\nPolished, very detailed.
