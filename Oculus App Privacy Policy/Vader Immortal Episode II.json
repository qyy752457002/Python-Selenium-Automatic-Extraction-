Just needed longer gameplay for the amount of money I put into it.\n\nHelpful | 171", "brett_dJul 29 at 4:49 AM\nGood story, the dojo is the main draw.\n\nDefinetly play through the story, its fun and well done. Short but for the price I am not worried. That said the dojo is the best bit in all three games. I find this the hardest given some of the times you are expected to get but lots of fun. Spent about 10 hours in the ep 2 dojo so far.\n\nHelpful | 5", "Gonefishiing2 hours ago\nGreat game with fun mechanics\n\nSuch a great addition to the Star Wars story with a engaging story telling, and unique game design. The main story is fun, but a little short. The saber dojo well makes up for it with hours of content and unlocks with unique sabers and more. The force ability is very well implemented and feels great. The only thing holding this game back from a 5 star is the lack of content in the main quest\n\nHelpful | 0", "jakecwolfJul 9 at 8:49 AM\nHaven't even played whole game yet\n\nThe only thing I could see keeping this game from being five stars is the complaint that it's not that long. and that's fair, its also kind of your own fault. I highly recommend starting the dojo before the actual gameplay. my family and i have played it for hours collectively and arent done yet. don't even move to the game play until you've mastered the dojo. it is part of the game and its hours of fun.\n\nHelpful | 11", "DotheDeuelJun 11 at 5:06 PM\nFinally feel like a Jedi\n\nThe campaign mode picks up where the last one left off and (just like the first one) it's beautifully done and laughably short. That being said you can now use the force and throw your lightsaber in the dojo. That's all you need to know. It is so incredibly fun to force pull droids into each other while throwing your lightsaber at a distant enemy that the campaign is entirely irrelevant. You will have an absolute blast every minute of the dojo!\n\nHelpful | 19", "Breedan12 days ago\nLoved it\n\nWhile I loved the story and dojo. I would also love the dojo to be developed with advanced features. Let me set how many can attack at once, how which type of attackers, attack delay times etc. I want to be able to increase the challenge in a custom way\n\nHelpful | 2", "rockwithtime3 days ago\nWouldnt buy myself, but very fun.\n\nIm not a huge star wars guy but regardless i still had fun playing. Personally i wouldnt spend the money on this because im not that into star wars. The series came with my quest purchase and im happy it did. If you like star wars and are intrested in this game i recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "IamStorm10 days ago\nLove the dojo\n\nOk five stars, but know this game is ridiculously short. I think like 25 minutes maybe. But it was crazy fun to play and got my heart pumping at one point. I wont give any spoilers.\n\nAnd the dojo is awesome. Im a level 50 Jedi and love the challenge its giving me trying to beat each level.\n\nUsing the force is super awesome. Id highly recommend trying this game out, and I cant wait to try out episode 3 as well.\n\nHelpful | 1", "DjWolffeJun 30 at 12:22 PM\nCoolest Star Wars experience ever\n\nCoolest thing ever. My first game on the quest. 11/10. Blows every other game out of the water. Some of my opinion comes from my obsession with Star Wars, but the graphics and storyline is simply amazing. Like other reviewers say, it's really short, and is probably not worth buying unless you plan on buying all three for the whole experience. If you're a Star Wars fanatic though, you'll definitely want this.\n\nHelpful | 7", "lamahunter3 days ago\nGreat addition to a ever expanding story\n\nThis game takes all of what is great about the first in the series and improves upon it. With the new game adding the ability to force chose oversized murder hornets this game is a welcomed addition to the star wars franchise\n\nHelpful | 0", "RoreoOreo10 days ago\nReally awesome game\n\nI have played all the games in this series and they were all amazing. I started playing this series after I got pretty settled into vr and yet it was so amazing I dont even like Star Wars that much would definitely recommend\n\nHelpful | 1", "awarth2215 days ago\nDifferent From Most Reviews\n\nI have no problem with the length of the experience, probably since im a 50 year old newcomer and Ive just learned to spell VR. :) But I actually thought using the force wasnt simple to master it took me a while to stop bringing the boulders straight at my face in the dojo. Graphics are tight throughout and the battles can be intense. Just dont let folks tell you its too short and easy. The dojo is fun and progressively more challenging and the story puts you in conversations with Darth Vader for $10 bucks! What more do we want?\n\nHelpful | 5", "Bandit_BawsJul 25 at 12:45 PM\nThe force is just.....awesome\n\nI cant even describe how awesome it is to pick someone up with your left hand, throw your lightsaber at them and then make it come back. Pick them up and bring them towards you only to put your lightsaber between you and them. The amount of fun I had with this game thats just 9.99 is astonishing, if you are thinking about buying this. Do it. (The dojo makes it worth the money!)\n\nHelpful | 1", "cousinbeefytJul 8 at 3:51 PM\nGreat but short\n\nThe game itself is just an amazing game. However I find it extremely short. even though it is long it just feels very short. I guess it's because we're just having too much fun in using the force and beating people to death with a lightsaber  but entirely it's just awesome and definitely deserves a five-star.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Mr.DILLIGAFJun 2 at 6:08 AM\nToo Short Even For $9.99\n\nLightsaber Dojo adds a little bit of longevity to the gaming exoerience, but the story is quick and probably not something you'll feel the need to replay again.\n\nI have all the Vader chapters. I'd recommend skipping Chapter I completely, maybe do II because of lightsaber dojo and definitely get III.\n\nHelpful | 7", "ComicalFlea8195May 5 at 1:02 AM\nReally good but...\n\nGreat game, Im not gonna mention mechanics and stuff because there pretty obvious though... This is to the developers: please add a way so players can try all the lightsabers, Ive been grinding for days and cant unlock specific lightsabers like the ones count duku(sorry if I spelled the name wrong)uses and stuff. I know many players will agree. Id be fine with there being another game revolved around the lightsabers dojo if it comes to it!\n\nHelpful | 43", "MadHatter42Jul 8 at 5:28 PM\nAwesome but way to short\n\nThis game is AMAZING!!! However, its way to short. I finished this episode in 30 min tops. The graphics were really cool but if it wasnt for the dojo training I would be upset with this purchase. The training aspect of the game is awesome. Of course I have to see how this story ends so ya Im gonna get the third episode. But I wish they would have put all three episodes into one package for $14.99 or something. Its not really a game you play over and over. Maybe after some time passes.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Sgt.Epic93A day ago\nVader immortal II\n\nI am 50 and my son is 12. We both love this game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "GJCorban9 days ago\nEqual parts overpriced and must-play\n\n- Incredibly polished and pretty but gameplay is so-so\n- Story is fun and Vader is terrifying in person\n- Dojo is eh, campaign is short\n\nHelpful | 0", "Mclk8322 days ago\nGreat but going to get costly\n\nGreat game but short... think about it as a movie broken down into 8 parts ... love the franchise but they got to keep it accessible to the fans!\n\nHelpful | 1", "TrentMBakerJul 23 at 4:10 AM\nRating\n\nThis was an amazing game, I loved everything about it except its just a bit short. There isnt much game time and because of that the game wasnt really as great as it could have been\n\nHelpful | 1", "BearlyawakeJun 11 at 2:52 PM\nDojo=Where you'll spend all your time\n\nI'm very angry at this game because...\na) I had so much fun in the campaign and now I HAVE to buy episode 3\nb)we just scratched the surfaced of force abilities making me want them so much more\nc)I derive so much joy from throwing the lightsaber that the sound it makes has started to annoy even me\n\nHelpful | 4", "tony.hiles.544Mar 31 at 1:48 PM\nStunning Vr showcase\n\nSimply put this is the most immersive Star Wars experience I have encountered and that includes The Void and their Secrets of The Empire. I purchased Quest after playing Episode 1. As a Star Wars fan this is a dream come true. I wont spoil the experience but there are some incredible moments and the sense of scale is truly impressive. Ive seen numerous reviews moaning about the cost or the length of the game. Ignore them. Its around 7.99 each chapter which is the price of a burger. VR doesnt have to always be 30 hour gaming epics. And this feels like an experiment to test the market. Lets not forget VR is still niche in terms of install base. Yes I would like more, as do all the negative reviewers. But that just underlined the fact that the Devs have got this right. For me these 3 titles have hammered home the fact that VR offers something traditional games cannot. I hope these sell well and we see expanded content. The thought of playing through areas covered in the original trilogy, Death Star trench run or battle of Hoth for example, leave me giddy. Fantastic job and a big thank you to the team that put this gem together.\n\nHelpful | 121", "Japrobe05Jul 11 at 10:48 PM\nAMAZING\n\nThe story is good and the playability is great the lightsaber dojo II is great with force. But its incredibly short I finished the campaign in one siting but me and my cousins have been playing the dojo practically 24/7\n\nHelpful | 0", "Punkster8816 days ago\nI'm sorry, but this is not worth $10\n\nLook, I absolutely love Star Wars. Everything about it is amazing. But this my friends, this is not worth $10. Bought it and beat it within 30 minutes. Honestly, it is absolutely insulting that this was a $10 experience. $6-7 is more fitting. Hopefully episode 3 is worth the price of admission.\n\nHelpful | 1", "YungTweakJul 16 at 8:58 PM\nShort, but phenomenal fun\n\nA little short for the price. But for $10, this is better than any Disney ride Ive been on! Worth it for the experience of being in a Star Wars movie. Cant wait to see what they do down the road with this franchise and VR.\n\nHelpful | 0", "SEAN07134 days ago\nThe game is good\n\nIt is good but short and I recommend\n\nHelpful | 0", "CJW201912 days ago\nYou can almost skip this one\n\nPart one was great! It made you feel you were in a movie. Part two feels like you are in a cheapish game. Bad visuals and bad choices. Uninteresting story.\nYou learn how to use the Force, so if you want to play the next chapters you have endure this one.\n\nHelpful | 0", "BloodyShanglongMay 19 at 6:36 PM\nBest title on Oculus quest.\n\nFor a free game it is worth the play, the story is surprisingly interactive. It's chilling standing in front of Darth Vader. The story is short (about 30 minutes) but the Lightsaber Dojo II is worth it. It's feels amazing to be able to swing, and throw your Lightsaber, plus you can use the force to pull or throw objects. Well worth it.\n\nHelpful | 7", "mrfly303015 days ago\nBest game ever\n\nThis has got to be the best game I have ever played so far.\n\nHelpful | 0", "guyperson1234Jul 20 at 10:00 AM\nFun\n\nIt was fun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVery fun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like the part where you use the force\n\nHelpful | 2", "un-masked-immortal24 days ago\nVadar immortal\n\nExcellent graphics fantastic Emerson but just not long enough\n\nHelpful | 0", "chrismgarlandMay 28 at 2:05 AM\nAbsolutely amazing\n\n5 stars to the games themselves, 3 stars for the price. Then again, I dont know what all it takes to produce something like this. An absolute must to own. Darth Vader is terrifying, and I wasnt even a Star Wars fan before playing this. I am now.\n\nHelpful | 6", "PhasmaKnightJun 22 at 5:04 PM\nGreat!\n\nIt was really fun and scary enough to scare you but not enough for you too stop playing I wish it was longer though. So about 4.5/5.\n\nHelpful | 3", "spyder_jayJun 12 at 9:44 PM\nI love this game, but...\n\nI really love this game. It is a great part of the story and has great graphics, but I always run into a couple situations that I believe to be glitches. Every time I fight against the sentinel droids (with my lightsaber), there is always a moment when their weapons pass through my lightsaber like it wasnt there. Thats an even bigger problem when I am at the part of the episode where I am about to retrieve the bright star (hidden chambers, my favorite part)and more sentinels show up. When they attack and I block with one hand, the same problem happens where the weapon would phase through my lightsaber. Also, I noticed that when I used the force, at times, my hand would stay in that force program, which is my hand still moving and working as if I am using the force but I am really not. Other than those things, it is a really good part of the series and I am looking forward to more Star Wars games.\n\nHelpful | 1", "MemefrogJul 26 at 5:31 PM\nGreat game, lots of content\n\nI got this game and was unsure at first, but when I played this, I loved it. The fight and dojo were my favorites\n\nHelpful | 0", "HUCK-007Jul 10 at 11:59 AM\nThe Jedi Way\n\nIf ever you wanted to be a Jedi in your life this is the app for you! I love it! The story is pretty short, but very fun. And the challenge modes are excellent! Can't wait to try episode III.\n\nHelpful | 1", "soulseeker13Jul 7 at 5:36 PM\nGreat but short\n\nGameplay is amazing get the first one before the second. The storyline is amazing but it leaves you on a insane cliff hanger so if you can buy all three in the same day so your not on as many cliffhangers.\n\nHelpful | 1", "brqm.pApr 28 at 5:40 AM\nCool game\n\nIt is an cool game. Bit short but that is not a big problem for this amassing game. If you are new to vr this is a game you must play. A good story line, fit in the Star Wars theme (not about the movies). The first time I had the power over an lightsaber it left like I was a real jedi. The arena/combat gamemode is also a good feature! This is a must do VR game.\n\nHelpful | 7", "BDanka15 days ago\n\nCant wait to play the third episode.\n\nHelpful | 0", "jeffrey.sparrow.3310 days ago\n\nJust Awesome\n\nHelpful | 1", "Bradycoolman15 days ago\nGood game\n\nI love the game and graphics\n\nHelpful | 1", "LagganisJul 21 at 11:05 AM\nThe dojos better than the game\n\nDont get me wrong the story was good but I enjoyed the combat at the dojo more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ZandCJul 21 at 10:43 AM\nThis game is AMAZING!!!!!!\n\nI am a huge star wars fan and once I tried this game, I fell in love!!!!!!

But truthfully the storyline is empty and not worth doing and so so short.\nHOWEVER. And its a big however.\nWith the lightsaber dojo (especially with episode 2) it is basically a childhood fantasy. Lightsabers and force powers. The way it works is absolutely brilliant, if not seductive on ways to the dark side by experimenting how to take down the enemys in different ways. Some will not like the wave based system, but if you get into it, for a second, your think your a jedi, albeit a potential sith.\nIn short 7.99 is not worth the price for the plot or story. Is it worth it for the dojo alone?perhaps.

I'm Bob Bumble.\n- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.\n\n\nA tri-county bee, Barry Benson,\n\n\nintends to sue the human race\nfor stealing our honey,\n\n\npackaging it and profiting\nfrom it illegally!\n\n\nTomorrow night on Bee Larry King,\n\n\nwe'll have three former queens here in\nour studio, discussing their new book,\n\n\nOlassy Ladies,\nout this week on Hexagon.\n\n\nTonight we're talking to Barry Benson.\n\n\nDid you ever think, \"I'm a kid\nfrom the hive. I can't do this\"?\n\n\nBees have never been afraid\nto change the world.\n\n\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\n\n\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\n\n\nWe were thinking\nof stickball or candy stores.\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\nThe bee community\nis supporting you in this case,\n\n\nwhich will be the trial\nof the bee century.\n\n\nYou know, they have a Larry King\nin the human world too.\n\n\nIt's a common name. Next week...\n\n\nHe looks like you and has a show\nand suspenders and colored dots...\n\n\nNext week...\n\n\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\n\n\nBear Week next week!\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\n\n\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\n\n\nIn tennis, you attack\nat the point of weakness!\n\n\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\n\n\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\n\n\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\n\n\n- Is that that same bee?\n- Yes, it is!\n\n\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\n\n\n- Hello.\n- Hello, bee.\n\n\nThis is Ken.\n\n\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\nten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\n\n\nWhy does he talk again?\n\n\nListen, you better go\n'cause we're really busy working.\n\n\nBut it's our yogurt night!\n\n\nBye-bye.\n\n\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\n\n\nYou poor thing.\nYou two have been at this for hours!\n\n\nYes, and Adam here\nhas been a huge help.\n\n\n- Frosting...\n- How many sugars?\n\n\nJust one. I try not\nto use the competition.\n\n\nSo why are you helping me?\n\n\nBees have good qualities.\n\n\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\n\n\nInstead of flowers, people\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\n\n\nThose are great, if you're three.\n\n\nAnd artificial flowers.\n\n\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n- Yeah, me too.\n\n\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\n\n\nBees must hate those fake things!\n\n\nNothing worse\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\n\n\nMaybe this could make up\nfor it a little bit.\n\n\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n- I guess.\n\n\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\n\n\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\n\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\n\nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\n\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\n\nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\n\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\n\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\n\nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\n\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\n\nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n\n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\n\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\n\nYou boys work on this?\n\n\nAll rise! The Honorable\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\n\n\nAll right. Oase number 4475,\n\n\nSuperior Oourt of New York,\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\n\n\nis now in session.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing\nthe five food companies collectively?\n\n\nA privilege.\n\n\nMr. Benson... you're representing\nall the bees of the world?\n\n\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n\nTalking bee!\n\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n\nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\n\nMr. Benson?\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n\nbut everything we are!\n\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n\nOall your first witness.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n\nI suppose so.\n\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n\n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n\n- No.\n- No.\n\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n\nYou mean like this?\n\n\nBears kill bees!\n\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n\n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n\nOh, please.\n\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\n\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\n\nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\n\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n\nI see from your resume\nthat you're devilishly handsome\n\n\nwith a churning inner turmoil\nthat's ready to blow.\n\n\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n\n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\n\nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n\n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\n\nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\n\nI think the jury's on our side.\n\n\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\n\nI'm a florist.\n\n\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\n\nTo a great team!\n\n\nWell, hello.\n\n\n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n\nDo we?\n\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\n\nLook at that.\n\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n\n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n\nA lot of ads.\n\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n\nNot as much.\n\n\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\n\n\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\n\n\nI've got issues!\n\n\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\n\n\n- You're bluffing.\n- Am I?\n\n\nSurf's up, dude!\n\n\nPoo water!\n\n\nThat bowl is gnarly.\n\n\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\n\n\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\n\n\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\nI don't eat it!\n\n\nWe need to talk!\n\n\nHe's just a little bee!\n\n\nAnd he happens to be\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n\n\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n\nAnd for your information,\n\n\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n\n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\n\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\n\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\n\nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\n\nto that woman?\n\n\nWe're friends.\n\n\n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow good? Do you live together?\n\n\nWait a minute...\n\n\nAre you her little...\n\n\n...bedbug?\n\n\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\n\ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n\n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n\n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\n\nHold me back!\n\n\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\n\nHe's denouncing bees!\n\n\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n\n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\n\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\n\nOh, I'm hit!!\n\n\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\n\nOrder! Order!\n\n\nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\n\nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\n\nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\n\nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n\n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\n\nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\n\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\n\nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\n\nOrder, please!\n\n\nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\n\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\n\nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n\n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n\n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\n\nI...\n\n\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\n\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n\nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\n\nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\n\nOh, my.\n\n\nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n\n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke.\n\n\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\n\nThat's it! That's our case!\n\n\nIt is? It's not over?\n\n\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\n\nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\n\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\n\nMr. Flayman.\n\n\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\n\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\n\nShow me the smoking gun!\n\n\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\n\nHere is your smoking gun.\n\n\nWhat is that?\n\n\nIt's a bee smoker!\n\n\nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\n\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\n\nLook at what has happened\n\n\nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\n\nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\n\nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\n\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\n\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n\n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\n\nVanessa, we won!\n\n\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\n\nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\n\nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\n\nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\n\nYou'll regret this.\n\n\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\n\nAll right. One at a time.\n\n\nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\n\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n\n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\n\nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\n\nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\n\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\n\nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\n\nevery last drop.\n\n\nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\n\nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\n\nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\n\nWait for my signal.\n\n\nTake him out.\n\n\nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\n\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\n\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\n\nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\n\nOan't breathe.\n\n\nBring it in, boys!\n\n\nHold it right there! Good.\n\n\nTap it.\n\n\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n\n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\n\nShut down honey production!\n\n\nStop making honey!\n\n\nTurn your key, sir!\n\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\n\nOannonball!\n\n\nWe're shutting honey production!\n\n\nMission abort.\n\n\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\n\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\n\nOh, yeah?\n\n\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n\n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\n\nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n\nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\n\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n\nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\n\nAnd now...\n\n\nNow I can't.\n\n\nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\n\nI thought their lives would be better!\n\n\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\n\nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n\n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThat is not the half of it.\n\n\nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\n\nThey're all wilting.\n\n\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\n\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\n\nBees?\n\n\nSpecifically, me.\n\n\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\n\nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\n\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\n\nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\n\nAnd then, of course...\n\n\nThe human species?\n\n\nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\n\nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\n\nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\n\nHow about a suicide pact?\n\n\nHow do we do it?\n\n\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\n\nRight, right.\n\n\nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\n\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\n\nVanessa?\n\n\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\n\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\n\nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\n\nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\n\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\n\nI know. Me neither.\n\n\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\n\nWait a minute. Roses. Roses?\n\n\nRoses!\n\n\nVanessa!\n\n\nRoses?!\n\n\nBarry?\n\n\n- Roses are flowers!\n- Yes, they are.\n\n\nFlowers, bees, pollen!\n\n\nI know.\nThat's why this is the last parade.\n\n\nMaybe not.\nOould you ask him to slow down?\n\n\nOould you slow down?\n\n\nBarry!\n\n\nOK, I made a huge mistake.\nThis is a total disaster, all my fault.\n\n\nYes, it kind of is.\n\n\nI've ruined the planet.\nI wanted to help you\n\n\nwith the flower shop.\nI've made it worse.\n\n\nActually, it's completely closed down.\n\n\nI thought maybe you were remodeling.\n\n\nBut I have another idea, and it's\ngreater than my previous ideas combined.\n\n\nI don't want to hear it!\n\n\nAll right, they have the roses,\nthe roses have the pollen.\n\n\nI know every bee, plant\nand flower bud in this park.\n\n\nAll we gotta do is get what they've got\nback here with what we've got.\n\n\n- Bees.\n- Park.\n\n\n- Pollen!\n- Flowers.\n\n\n- Repollination!\n- Across the nation!\n\n\nTournament of Roses,\nPasadena, Oalifornia.\n\n\nThey've got nothing\nbut flowers, floats and cotton candy.\n\n\nSecurity will be tight.\n\n\nI have an idea.\n\n\nVanessa Bloome, FTD.\n\n\nOfficial floral business. It's real.\n\n\nSorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.\n\n\nThank you. It was a gift.\n\n\nOnce inside,\nwe just pick the right float.\n\n\nHow about The Princess and the Pea?\n\n\nI could be the princess,\nand you could be the pea!\n\n\nYes, I got it.\n\n\n- Where should I sit?\n- What are you?\n\n\n- I believe I'm the pea.\n- The pea?\n\n\nIt goes under the mattresses.\n\n\n- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.\n- I'm getting the marshal.\n\n\nYou do that!\nThis whole parade is a fiasco!\n\n\nLet's see what this baby'll do.\n\n\nHey, what are you doing?!\n\n\nThen all we do\nis blend in with traffic...\n\n\n...without arousing suspicion.\n\n\nOnce at the airport,\nthere's no stopping us.\n\n\nStop! Security.\n\n\n- You and your insect pack your float?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHas it been\nin your possession the entire time?\n\n\nWould you remove your shoes?\n\n\n- Remove your stinger.\n- It's part of me.\n\n\nI know. Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\n\n\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\njust enough pollen to do the job.\n\n\nOan you believe how lucky we are? We\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\n\n\nI think this is gonna work.\n\n\nIt's got to work.\n\n\nAttention, passengers,\nthis is Oaptain Scott.\n\n\nWe have a bit of bad weather\nin New York.\n\n\nIt looks like we'll experience\na couple hours delay.\n\n\nBarry, these are cut flowers\nwith no water.

It allows much more creative freedom using the force, your lightsaber, and traps in an arena to bring murder on so many things throughout multiple rounds. You are scored based on speed of eliminations, amount of eliminations, saber duel form, etc. you get rewarded based on performance and unlock new sabers and gloves based on the results.

Though this particular episode is not as adventurous as the other two, you wouldn't want to skip it if you're going to try both episodes 1 and 3. I found the dark characters surprisingly intimidating, especially when I tried stepping to the side only to find they were still staring straight at me.

There are no consequences to worry about. Hit detection is meh, and the final duel was laughably lame. This is really just an immersive story, which is done really well.

The wait was worth it.\n\nGreat game, but... It seemed much shorter than the first episode. However, still top notch and the gameplay is very satisfying. The telekinesis mechanics are very well done. So many ways to vanquish your enemies. I just hope the ep.3 story mode is a bit longer.\n\nUpdate: after playing the game more and pondering my review, I'd like to say this: Although the story part of the game is shorter, the game mechanics are more complex and the Jedi Dojo 2 is far more complicated than the fist one. This is reflected by the fact that episode 2 contains about 40% more data than episode 1. So players aren't getting \"ripped off\" at all. We're actually getting lots more value with ep.2. And I must say, although the story mode is shorter, Jedi Dojo 2 has held my interest much more than the first one. You feel like a proper Jedi in this one. I can't get enough.\n\nPS: for everyone that whines about Quest games being too short, AAA games on a console or PC are 20- 80gb. When your entire drive is 64gb, this just isn't practical. Yes the games are much shorter, but they're also much cheaper. If you think you could do better, I encourage you to do so. Fact is, you don't know what you're talking about. Stop giving Quest games bad reviews because they don't live up to your ridiculous expectations.\n\nHelpful | 40", "K177AJan 8 at 12:00 PM\nAwsome but also awsome short!\n\nThe game is so much fun, but it is way too short...I was lucky to buy my Quest now( 01.2020) so I got the Vader Immortal Games 1+2+3 for free, but if I would have bought them, I would be frustrated like many others. When you wanna make a pizza in your oven at home, you can play one part of these games in the time the pizza needs. That's way too little in my opinion. If there would someone work on a game in this style that gives us 20 hours it would be worth like 50 or 60 for me, hell, maybe 70 or 80. But these little parts should be a demo I think.

One of the complaints Ive seen a lot is that it is too short. I really didnt notice that. If anything, it actually felt slightly longer than the first, but Im most likely wrong on that if so many people say otherwise. With this in mind, the saber dojo adds a lot more time on, especially when considering how it adds on saber throwing, which is incredibly fun. The force lock on can be a little wonky and when there are too many targets you can use the force on on screen, you WILL end up picking the wrong one and the force controlling itself is slightly wonky.

With the great graphics, detail, and immersive sence of depth and scale that can only happen in VR, I took my time in every new area and just soaked in everything about where I was standing. Also when you physically look up in VR at a towering rancor beast lifting his leg to stomp on you, WOW the sensation that envelopes you is way more immersive than you would get sitting on a couch with the rancor 10 feet away from you on a flat TV. Throw in a bunch of interactions with you using the force or your light saber, and also a great dojo wave fighter, and you really feel like you just came back from another world when it's done.

The real game here is the lightsaber dojo, and Im surprised many people seem to miss that. Many hours of game play there. It is a blast getting the force integrated into the action. Its fast paced and challenging with plenty of replay-ability. Episode 1s dojo was the most played game on our quest since day 1, and I have little doubt this will be right up there as well. I have had some tracking issues, which isnt too surprising considering the 360 action and speed of gameplay, so you have to be somewhat attentive of where your hands are, but it wasnt enough of a problem to stop me from already logging 5+ hours by day 2...\n\nIts really fun overall, but it loses points on a couple minor things:\n1- Some tracking issues in the dojo and story. 2- the way that everything goes black if you get too close to a wall in the story or step over the line in the dojo and it tells you to go back into the play area. 3- it generally just feels a little less polished in certain ways than episode 1. 4- the characters that are your companions kinda drive me crazy.\n\nHelpful | 2", "N7CreedDec 1 at 4:59 AM\nAmazing game, just too short\n\nCertainly one of the best modern star wars games made.

Every spectacular in every direction you look; but that detail comes with a price, mainly file size, it took my slow internet 4 hours to download a single episode and only about 15 minutes to play through.

And combat was phenomenal. All I have to say is it was amazing and short. Short but sweet. It will be super fun. And the light saber dojo is sooooo much fun. So is it worth it. Yes it is. Even though its short. Your getting a lot more than your paying for. $10 is insanely cheep for how immersive this game is. And even though the first one was the same price, and longer. This one fills in the empty holes with fun mechanics that werent in the first and fresh exciting combat with unpredictable moves.

Its not a 50-minute game. Thats like saying Battlefront II is a 50-minute game. Vader Immortal has a 30-50-minute campaign depending on how quickly you get through it. But it also has a Dojo that you can spend SO MUCH MORE TIME IN. Ive spent countless hours in the dojo in episode 1 trying to perfect my saber skills and blaster deflection. Its amazing. And now with the ability to use the Force, perform lightsaber throws, and utilize traps, I expect Ill be enjoying myself for another year before getting bored.\n\nSECOND OF ALL. ITS STAR WARS. STAR WARS IS BASICALLY REAL NOW, YOU ENTITLED PUNK. STOP COMPLAINING, OR MAKE YOUR OWN. TAKE A CODING CLASS, AND YOU. GO. MAKE. ONE. Well see how close YOURS is to being perfect.

It feels like you are in a passenger seat of a theme ride more than anything else, especially during the fight instances with the rancor. Largely the experience is about going to different way points where you freeze in place and then take some action. I was also frustrated by how little leeway the experience gave to to experiment and fail.

After that, I had extremely high expectations for the second installment, and I wound up disappointed. This one just didnt feel as much like Star Wars. I want to fight with an actual lightsaber, not some weird laser sword. It made it feel more like a knockoff. The gameplay was much shorter, and we didnt get many new developments in the plot.

I was hoping for more light saber combat, but more of it was using the Force, which, while fun, can be a bit janky. More importantly, my right hand wasnt working? Im semi ambidextrous so I like switching between my right and left hand with the light saber (mainly left), but every time I passed it to my right the tracking was all off and my hand did this weird flexing thing when I didnt press any buttons. I think it was a byproduct of either a) the game navigation or b) the Force mechanic. Its fine at certain points but then itll get real weird.

However it has two very big issues, thus the 3 stars. One, the story is short, very short, roughly 1/3rd of episode 1. It also lacks the nuance that made episode 1 really good. No \"behind the scenes\" Vader moments, limited characters, for all intents and purposes it simply treads water. The second issue is that it's treated as a separate game independent of Episode one. Meaning it takes up more space than it would had it been made more like DLC. It also means I can't seamlessly play ep1 through to the end of ep2. This approach also segregates the dojo, I have to unlock everything again, instead of keeping my scores and unlocks for ep1 and having new content to unlock in ep2, it's just doing a different dojo for the same stuff. What if I would like to replay the original dojo and spank it with force powers? As far as I know, not possible. Again, polished Star Wars experience, just marred by poor development execution and very short story.\n\nHelpful | 3", "DaPugE1Nov 14 at 1:25 PM\nBest game on quest\n\nYes short story.

The voice acting and the interactions are great, but it feels like not only is the story shorter but you also do less. There could have been a few more challenges at least. (It doesnt help that when you misuse the force in certain sections of the story, the game doesnt realize you messed up and it continues awkwardly like you did something right after a long pause).

Having more flexibility within the game to use more powers and even explore other side themes and places, even hunting for some easter eggs hidden by the developer would be nice. The game feels like a movie and your movements just go along with it, so more free will wondering around would be great like other PC games. The JEDI DOJO feature of the game is AWESOME and is the only reason I didn't immediately get a refund after 30 minutes of gameplay.

Rather than a VR game. That is reserved for the dojo. The single dojo that demands you stay put and seems to have an issue with using both hand's abilities as freely as I would like. The story mode serves as a very long tutorial for the dojo, although in this case, not that long.\nWhat it ISN'T: A single app with in-game chapters purchases and dojo updates. As a single game, replaying the story mode would make sense. Or just buy the whole game at once and have hours of enjoyment, building up your abilities the whole time.\nThis also isn't the best VR game I've ever played. It's very controlled. You stay in one spot and interact with only what it tells you to interact with. Even in the dojo, you can't just reach out and grab the objects and throw them around like you might in Robo Recall. The tools you've been given are meant to work in very specific ways. Games like Space Pirate Trainer do a better job of giving you the tools and letting you be creative with them. And this game is very static. Even in games with single positions, like Elven Assassin, you still have some freedom of physical movement.\nUltimately what this game isn't: Battlefront. Give me lightsabers, the force, blasters, free movement, vehicles to drive/fly, single mode and multiplayer. Give me a REAL game.\nOr at least stop making every game an intro to VR.

Yes, the game is short, 30-40 minutes tops. No, its not a ripoff.\n\nJust like with the first episode, youre in for a ride and one of the best VR experiences currently out there. Best of all, it truly does feel like Star Wars, in an age where everything Disney releases is bad to mediocre.\n\nGood graphics and design, good music, good storyline and sweet gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe dojo is what truly shines with this episode, and is what youll be spending most of your time playing. Lots of challenges and rewards, and using the Force to bring down enemies or toss your lightsaber feels incredible. Id have paid $10 for the dojo alone.\n\nThe people out there complaining and giving this game low scores are simply salty about the story being short.

Awesome graphics, a smooth and fun gameplay style, and a almost too good to be true feeling while playing. But the developers didnt focus enough on the story. You guys made the dojo thing really fun with all the customization and reward winning, but, its like you just stopped in the story. The story is good but it felt way too short. Why wasnt there more build up to getting the star! Why wasnt there more of a challenge when fighting the Sentinels? Why does the campaign last 25 minutes instead of around 50 like the other game? What I think what happened was that the devs wanted to push out the game but were getting too close to a deadline and cut a bunch of content ideas. This is what happens when too much of your time is spent focusing on a mini game than the actual story.

Also to on have one environment eas lacking in my experience and lack of the lighting force. It could be better the platform is good it just needs more diverse environments, maybe a battle on space with xwing and tie fighter's would be amazing.

As a lifetime Star Wars fan, Ill happily pay $10 for whatever time in the Star Wars universe I can get. Also, the dojo is way better. The ring you stand in feels a bit larger for one.

There is a lack of precision so it frequently feels sloppy. I wish it worked more like the telekinesis in the Espire games, perhaps controlling objects in 3d space using the right analog stick to simultaniously allow for free locomotion using the left in the future.\n\nSpeaking of free locomotion, I turned this on before starting the story. Perhaps that's why the story felt clunky, glitchy, and buggy at times. Worse still, the game crashed and ejected me into Oculus Home with an error code with less than 5 mins left in the experience.\n\nI don't like the new \"lightsaber holsters\". They are way too far forward, well in front of my torso, and too canted.\n\n\nThe dojo was my favorite part of Eposode 1 and I earned every star. So far I'm about 8 levels into the new dojo and I'm not liking it as much, mainly because of the sloppy force power mechanics. There was an insanely easy level that took 5 seconds and was a complete joke. It doesn't feel like it's building off the knowledge and skill I acquired in the Episode 1 dojo. It would have been cool to receive some sweet gloves or some other perk as reward for unlocking all the lightsabers in Episode 1.\n\nUpdate: I'm on level 30 now and the dojo has really grown on me. It takes some time to learn when and how to use the 3 machines properly. However, the one on the right does have a glitch as it can stomp right through a robot without inflicting any damage sometimes.

Stun, grab, throw one enemy into another, drag one into your lightsaber, block a blaster bolt and angle it into another enemy, fling your lightsaber across the room into another while continuing to force throw other enemies everywhere.

It is unbelievably short, and while yes I respect that the climbing sections and fight at the end took an immense amount of effort to make, the story feels unfinished. There's an element of combat and force powers in the dojo which the story did not even attempt to teach me. Instead, I was left to figure out saber throws on my own. Besides that, the steps with Vader teaching you force powers feels unbelievably rushed. It begins VERY suddenly with vader nearly telling me \"Hey, you have these abilities that youve never before demonstrated. Enjoy.\" I did not get enough time with Vader to truly figure out my powers, instead being left to a likely non-canon dojo that will teach me my abilities so I can inexplicably do them in episode 3.\n\nOne last small gripe. The saber I got during the story? That thing is far too cool to ignore. So why, then, is it not an unlock option in the dojo?

Unlike the last episode where you had to be protective and have patience, you can just smash and slash through tons of enemies with new abillities. I find the story in this episode to be a bit lackluster, but I am totally fine with it. This episode serves as a stepping stool which gives you new mechanics and sets up what is going to happen in episode 3.

As a game this gets 1 star from me, it was glitchy and jittery, more so than anything else Ive played. It made me uncomfortable and nauseous. The gameplay itself is extremely underwhelming, the force is a gimmick at best, the enemy AI is horrible. Its essentially an interactive movie but only 30 minutes long so more of an interactive trailer to a movie? It only cost 10 bucks So Im not too distraught over my purchase but there are 360 movie related apps (Jurassic World, Blade Runner) that are free and much more interesting than this. Granted Im not a big Star Wars fan so if you are a fan then take my review with a grain of salt but I think they shouldve waited and combined the first Vader immortal with this one and with all the others to come and then as a whole I couldve probably given it 3 stars.

First it would be the size of many GB, that most users could not download because of limited free space. Secondly, the price would be very high, perhaps 50 to 60, and hence that would drasticaly reduce the will of most VR users to buy it. At least now they can buy one episode at a time, testing if they like it or not. It is like buying in doses, spending few money every 3 months.

However, the story-experience portion is indeed notably shorter than in the original. There have been some additions to the dojo mode, namely use of the force and some environmental elements, which is great. But from its own promotional materials above, the dojo certainly seems intended as secondary to the main experience.\n\nAlthough I'm glad to have Vader Immortal II, it strikes me as overpriced. I can't help but compare it to Exorcist, another experience based on an iconic, decades-long franchise that I also thoroughly enjoy playing. The Exorcist experience is priced at $25 for a package of 5 installments, which makes each individual installment worth $5. As such, while I have no regrets about having paid $10 for the first Vader Immortal, I do think that Vader Immortal II ought to be priced at $5.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Peaceful_MindOct 19 at 11:11 AM\nEnded up playing side missions only\n\nAdding the force telekinetic experience of lifting objects worths the money, very well syncronised controllers vibration which makes you feel like really having some energy in your hands.

I would've even been happy if the game was delayed 3 months to make an extra 25 minutes of play time where we assembled the robot army and got to the entrance of Vader's castle. That would've made my review a 5 star but I just cant do that for this game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "QUIX1986Oct 12 at 1:37 PM\nHad more expectations\n\nI really liked the first one! This one is nice but short. I didnt like it when you have to walk to the bleu marker all the time to start an event, the game gets predictable that way. It also didnt gave me a great starwars feel, you start in a cave and it ends in a cave. You get a lightsaber but not really need it. Overall it was ok but for me, i was expecting to fight stormtroopers with the force and lightsaber but we get a fight with a big monster and some droid enemys in 2 areas that you easy repetitive can kill by pressing the force button. Buy the first one! Check this one on youtube and lets wait for the next one.\n\nHelpful | 0", "avidediterSep 26, 2019 at 9:46 PM\nWay too short...\n\nI loved the first one, felt reminiscent of the Void experience, except having Vader stand right next to you was jaw dropping! This game gives you that again with a few other startles, but I felt ripped off to get a 20 minute story for the same price. Hopefully the final chapter will be an hour but I suspect we will get about 30 min. The dojo is fun, but I still can't get used to the force mechanics. They are not as intuitive as I thought they might.\n\nAlso had a few glitches getting stuck outside the world while climbing and also trying to put away my lightsaber to climb. Had to quit out of the game about 3-4 times\n\nHelpful | 8", "sbskoonSep 30 at 6:47 PM\nTHIS COULD BE SO GOOD BUT ITS NOT\n\nHonestly guys Id much rather pay 60 bucks for a full length Star Wars game with double bladed lightsabers, duel wielding, blasters, more characters from the canon, etc.\n\nMore specifically though, this game is infuriating. There are parts that are so good. But the story is so freaking short. The story is the best part, and its like twenty minutes. Stop releasing twenty minutes at a time. Take two to three years an make a good game.\n\nThe most infuriating part however, is that the only lengthy thing in the game is the wave mode. But its so repetitive, come on! Make some new enemies! I love the unlocking lightsaber feature, but seriously this is a headache to play. It gets super difficult, not because it takes skill, but because you just throw in more enemies. That is bad difficulty, not good difficulty. It is also difficult because it gets so hectic at times, but if you want the game to be hectic, you need to absolutely NAIL the force detection and the lightsaber block detection. I cannot count how many times Ive race quit the game because Im doing really well, then you throw a million bots at me and the game doesnt detect that I blocked that laser, or hit that guy, and I cannot grab things with the force consistently enough. It detects fine sometimes, but then other times it doesnt for seemingly no reason! Especially when there is more than one force target. Seriously guys, if your going to release a twenty minute tech demo as a game, you need to nail the physics and gameplay not good enough, but perfectly. You have the budget, you have the time.\n\nThis could be so good guys. Listen to what everyone is saying. We want a good Star Wars game from you guys because its obvious youre capable of it, but you fall so short. You can do it, but youre choosing not to.

It helped that the 40 leveled lightsaber dojo was a ton of fun and had good rewards and ways to customize the experience. Episode 2 feels a bit half assed unfortunately. The story chapter feels like half the length it should be and the lightsaber dojo while better to play with force powers is just more of the same. Disappointing, was really looking forward to this one. Each of the story chapters should be at least 1 to 2 hours long. With all three chapters together at $30 I should feel like I'm playing a solid 4 to 5 hour video game campaign and not watching a film that's less than 2 hours long for the price of a full priced Blu Ray.

Things that the first game got right seem to have been lost in this part. I've had it crash twice to the point where the quest had to be rebooted. The mechanic for using the force is just not right. It shouldnt be so hard to pick things up and throw them where you want but it is. I've watched 3 people all try and struggle in the same way. Blocking strikes for opponents seems to be hit & miss (excuse the pun) On the first game it made sense whereas in this you constantly get frustrated & it starts to feel unreal as you attempt to move you hands into positions that dont match what you're trying to do. On the plus side the graphics are amazing again, what they manage to get that mobile chipset to do is incredible. I just dont understand how the mechanics that worked and felt right in the first game seem to have been lost on this.

Who wouldnt want to learn the force from the one and only Darth Vader? After you escape from the rancor for the first time it all goes downhill very quickly. You get a new lightsaber (where did my old one go) that i dont really like the design of, but i could handle that. You defeat the rancor and get told what to do in the next game and then its over...

I chose comfort mode and large parts of the game would cut to black and I realized I was missing set piece moments. It makes sense but I didnt think I would miss anything, I iust thought I would skip camera shake and ladder climbs. Comfort mode is kind of inconsistent too because there were times where the whole platform would move and then cut to black mid conversation. There is also a lot of depth warp and ghosting with the image in this game, more so than in others. Like other people have mentioned it is a brief game, but it is so basic I wouldnt want to play it much longer. I would give a 2.5 if I could but I will round up to 3 because the art is decent.

Unfortunately the sudden and overly aggressive constraints on movement detract from the experience. In nearly every room at some point a black flash occurs and I'm suddenly locked in place and unable to move without the screen fading to black and a warning telling me I'm out of bounds, making this feel more akin to a disneyworld ride than a game during these moments.

The battles are all on rails. This is a concept that all Star Wars fans have been dying for, but its all executed poorly.\n\nWith that said, the dojo is the best part.

It's a fraction of the length of Part 1, and nowhere near as immersive or exciting. Part 1 felt like a story that YOU are part of. In Part 2 you feel like a superfluous onlooker. There's nothing on the level of interaction that part 1 had, such as unlocking doors, working the spacship, etc. Instead, I get to push a lever at one point (that doesn't even react well to hand grabbing). That's pretty much it, besides the 'force' interaction.\n\nSpeaking of the 'force' usage, it's quite frankly awful. There are no real instructions on how to make it work, and it feels stunningly clumsy and useless. It also doesn't appear to affect your progress, if you can't do it, either (despite characters telling you of the need to use it).\n\nVisually, the game is also disappointing, with only a couple of cool moments, unlike the fantastic scene-setting and 'Wow!' moments of Part 1.\n\nThe game is gltichy as well. Within a short run time, I had to restart levels three, yes THREE times, due to a) not being able to move at one point, b) getting 'use the force' message permanently stuck hovering over my hands, and c) an outright crash.\n\nWhat on earth went wrong?

In Episode 1 I felt it was a demo plus and Episode 2 is also a demo plus. This accords with it being free on the rift but 7.99 on the quest. Is this difference fair? The major plus point is stunning graphics and the life size interactions with other characters in a film like scenario. It is also Star Wars. As others have mentioned it is oh so brief as a result you are no sooner immersed in the world than you have to leave it. The narrative is much more controlling than episode 1 . Presence involves more than spatial visual cues but also the ability to act. Episode 1 at least allowed for a minor puzzle element and choices eg how to open a door but not episode 2. Here you were locked and unable to move with no choices. I even tried bouncing items off Vaders head to get a response but sadly nothing happened and no consequence followed. There is a monster but it is not a danger although it did make me jump. The extra powers were nice but limited and contrived. I felt more involved in Moss, my favourite game, and there could be more tension at times. The training sessions were easier than episode 1 and I soon got bored.

We expect that you treat us better than this other than burning the lore from previous cannon for your cartoons and inventing characters never before shown in movies. Don't do this wrong...

But a few issues\n\nI really loved this first episode, and there's a lot of great stuff to be found here as well. I did run into a number of small bugs which made for an unpolished experience. The game screen went to black twice while I was playing, with the worst time happening at the very end of the final battle of the game. I could hear the characters talking, but the screen was just black and I couldn't even bring up the in get menu. Had to close the game and reload. There were also a number of weird graphical glitches I noticed. In darker areas when you would move your head and forth the image would smear... A lot. I found it super distracting. My in game hands were also somewhat glitchy, where they would be stuck sort of clenched or half clentched. Hopefully these things can be addressed in a patch, so maybe hold off on playing for a bit.\n\nI do wish the game was closer to the length of episode one. It took me about 25 minutes start to finish.

Thats in my opinion way to less for 10.
