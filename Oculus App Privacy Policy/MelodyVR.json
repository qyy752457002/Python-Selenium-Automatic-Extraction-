I check my internet connection on the Quest and I have an excellent signal. I tried rebooting the headset, thinking that would work, but to no avail.\n\nHelpful | 15", "CizurMay 27 at 6:45 AM\nFeels like a private concert\n\nMelodyVR have started doing free gigs out of their brand new studios in LA. I used the Quest and was blown away. It feels like a private gig where the band are playing just for you. Sound quality was excellent.\nThe resolution on the Quest is not that sharp. There is definitely room for improvement here because if you watch MelodyVR on your phone the resolution is very sharp. People need to note that this service is for everyone and not just a headset experience. They have made it so people at the back of a live concert can just pull out their phone and watch what is happening at the front by selecting one of the many cameras. It really is a brilliant service and very accessible to the masses not just headset owners.\nMelodyVR are supposed to be moving to a subscription service this year rather than you having to pay for each gig separately. This will make a huge difference as it is currently too expensive to pay for each artist. If it ends up 9.99/mth for full access then I would say it's excellent value.\n\nIn conclusion, it's well worth a look. When it comes to music you should be moved when watching/listening and I was moved. It felt very intimate. All that is needed is for the resolution to be improved.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 7:40 AM\n\nHey! Thanks for the review we really appreciate it. Your feedback about the resolution is noted - we're constantly improving the app and the cameras we shoot the shows with and it's definitely an area where we're always looking to build on.

Concert that I attended to relive memories of the night, I was disappointed to find the video quality was WAY below the standard that was expected.\n\nAs I live in the UK, super fast Internet speeds are not always available, and as such with no method of downloading what I have paid for to watch locally this is an issue. My average speed being 12MB.\n\nAdditionally there is no settings offered to select the video quality manually and wait for buffering if you would prefer. There is no visual feedback to even show what your current video quality is!\n\nMelody VR has so much potential but lacks user friendly features that are key for any app to be widely regarded as a success.\nThis app should come with a minimum Internet speed requirement or guide at least, as well as video quality settings even if it's just a 720p,1080p,1440p toggle or something/anything. For people with slower speeds local downloading should be an option for paid for in app purchased content.\n\nHopefully some of these features can be added in the future which would easily increase my rating.\n\nHelpful | 25\nDeveloper ResponseDec 17 at 6:47 AM\n\nThanks for the review, we really appreciate the feedback!

However if you are an avid fan of live performance and VR then this is good stuff . The people who put this together really had done some homework . If you want center floor seats for ten bucks then you deserve the veiw . It's primarily for the light shows , uhm Horray if you need hints on where to clap, sing or eh . Your real money makers are the stage views and the sound quality .\nTransitioning from one scene to another is best done after viewing a show or set all the way through as they are not seamless ,if you purchase and entire performance which is your best bet .\nIf you're a fan of any of these artists why settle for being in the audience, unless you know for that song that's where you want to be whistles,bells and all ,but the feeling of being on stage and up close is something that these minor flaws are easily forgiven for .

Thin on the ground in content but MelodyVR have recorded content with over 700 artists so plenty to arrive!\n\nEven if there are no performances to your taste right now its worth keeping the app for future content and recently the UK Wireless festival was live streamed for free all weekend and the quality was fantastic! Looking forward to seeing the platform grow!\n\nHelpful | 18", "lanoh89Aug 22, 2019 at 2:06 PM\n2d\n\nAll videos are in 2d! sorry but if it's not 3d I just don't think it should be on VR!\n\nHelpful | 21\nDeveloper ResponseSep 17, 2019 at 3:22 AM\n\nWere sorry you are unhappy with the app. Were constantly looking to improve, so appreciate your feedback and will make sure we feed it in to future developments.", "BobbiHereAug 28, 2019 at 3:05 PM\n\nI enjoyed thus far.
