To that end, features and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviourally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Pixel also does not allow our third-party partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13.\n\nPixel and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of that nation.\n\nPixel and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Pixel also uses this data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a game). Pixel and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.\n\nPlease note that Pixels partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and ad-serving purposes. While Pixel requires that companies comply with Pixels privacy policy before Pixel allows those companies to access our sites and services, Pixel does not actually control third-party data collection and use.

I play it every weekend. I usually play multiplayer because I love the horde mode and its even more fun when you play with others. My only problem for this game is that sometimes I cant drop the weapon Im holding it just sticks. I also noticed that whenever I reach wave 18 and if I get mobbed by zombies it seems like theres a glitch or the game freezes up. My only other issue is with reloading my gun, lots of times it will say weapon malfunction or the gun tends load slowly.\n\nI also think we should be able to wear two guns at all times or maybe we could earn some of the heavier machine guns when we get to round 15, since thats when things get intense.\nOther than that I love this game.\n\nOne more thing, it would be great if 3 to 4 people could play this game on multiplayer.\n\nUpdate: I still love this game, but what did you guys do on this new update. Multiplayer is all screwed up and I live for multiplayer. The game doesn't recognize when both players are in the game, instead, it tells us waiting for players. Hopefully, you'll have this issue fixed quickly. I spent so much time yesterday trying to play the game. This is my go to game, as I only like playing on multiplayer. So please  fix this quickly.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper Response19 days ago\n\nHi, once again we're really sorry for the issues you faced with our July 2020 update. I just wanted to let you know our latest patch dropped yesterday to resolve these issues. Please let us know if the issues are resolved for you and if so, please do kindly re-consider your review.

Campaign is super fun, gun reload mechanic is great, weapons are awesome (axe especially).\n\nFeatures that would make this game absolutely phenomenal is co-op campaign, up to 4 players in horde mode, and a slightly more advanced multiplayer experience.. for instance, protect a house where you have to purchase barricades, guns, and protect multiple entrances. That would make this game THE MULTIPLAYER fps of VR.\n\nHelpful | 12", "scott.osmond.96520 days ago\nMultiplayer awaiting players message fix\n\nI experienced the same issue with multi player not working on the latest update. I have a work around tho. Both players need to hit the left menu controller button. When the option says No or Return to Base select No. You both may need to do this a few times and wait a couple of seconds for it to begin but I have gotten it to work every time by doing this. Good luck and get those Zs!\n\nAlso, the latest update took away the mouth moving on the avatars! That was such a cool feature. Bring it back please.\n\nAnd one other work around for sound issues on multiplayer. I have rarely been able to hear my partner on the first try when entering drop dead. I usually have to exit the game completely a few times and pray that the icon next to my partners name is showing a microphone and not a headset. If it is a headset - you wont hear them. If it is a microphone, you got a chance. Workaround: You both MUST exit any party chats started in Oculus BEFORE you enter Drop Dead. Drop Dead is apparently confused when trying to pause a party chat.\n\nAlso, add this to your bug list as well, somewhere around level 12 in solo horde mode, you sometimes get a loud whirring noise that never stops until you completely close down the game while in Oculus home. This has happened to me several times in ultimate showdown and Graveyard modes. Probably happens in all of them at some point.\n\nThis is my favorite oculus game. It provides a real distraction from this stressful Covid situation. Its taken so much time for us to figure out these work arounds. To the developers: Please dont release an update without fully testing it. Now that we know how to get around the bugs, it would be super frustrating to have to do that all over again or have things appear with no workarounds that would kill one of the few distractions we have to rely on.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper Response19 days ago\n\nHi, once again we're really sorry the issues you faced with our July 2020 update.

For the love of God though, please let me skip the intro sequences during levels. If you are going to make a game where I die this much, at least dont make me sit through the banal talk at the beginning of each level. I dont need checkpoints, but I want to get right back into it if I go down. It feels so slow to get restarted and start actually fighting again. This is enough to just make me go play something else which feels quicker. Make the overall flow of the game quicker and you have an easy 5 star game on your hands.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for adding the ability to skip cutscenes! I encountered another weird thing though. Why does this game require internet, even just to play the single player campaign? Where I live, there is fairly frequent load shedding, and I had been hoping to hammer out the last 3 levels of the 3rd timeline during a recent power outage, but I was not even able to start the game. Very frustrating! I don't care about leaderboards or horde mode, which obviously require internet. I just want to play the single player campaign.\n\nFinally as a hint to those who have been struggling with the final levels of the game. Make sure to charge up the default weapon when using it. Rapid fire with this gun is almost useless. Two charged up shots to the head/chest can even take down the instant death driller guys. Makes the game so much more possible! I am hoping to be able to beat the 3rd and final timeline soon!\n\nHelpful | 3", "Luelle7821 days ago\nNew update killed multiplayer\n\nUploaded the new update now cant play multiplayer mode.

Only downside is that in horde mode you always have to start again from the first wave. If you always get to wave 20+, you don't really want to waste 20mins playing the super easy waves 1 through 20, just to have 5 mins of fun in waves 20 and beyond.

The graphics are not the best, but good enough.\n\nThis game is an on rails shooter, which means you wont move by yourself. But the game moves you to specific locations on the same map.\n\nThere is a great variety of maps, enemies with different weakness/strengths and a lot of different guns.\n\nThe game includes a cheesy story campaign, divided in 3 different timelines. Each timeline is basically the same story with changes in the events happening. Each one is also harder than the last. And with new gimmicks.\n\nExpect a fair challenge in timeline 3. It took me many retries to complete, but you will learn from your mistakes.\n\nEven after you completed the main story, you can compete on the leaderboards or try to compete in the horde mode. Lots of replayability.\n\nAll in all, great game! Must buy for any zombie shooter fan.\n\nHelpful | 0", "War_Fenrir5 days ago\nI dig it, but...\n\nThe game first off is a blast, I streamed it the other day and everyone had such a fun time watching as I did playing.\n\nMy biggest hiccup was in grabbing the revolver, at times it didn't track that well and resulted in a few close calls\n\nNext was having to hold down the grip buttons for such a long time when moving from round to round and retaining picked up weapons. Being allowed to holster 1 additional weapon would be a nice.\n\nMinor issues that I'm sure will be worked out in future updates, other than that the game is awesome, I'll highly recommend this game as a fun VR starter game. \n\nP.s.\nAny chance of gun customization or dual weilding revolvers?

Great gameplay and story line. Was enjoyable right up until I got about 90% of the way through the first act. There's one level called Monday's Base that's literally next to impossible to beat. I've now spent almost 10 hours on the game and played the level well over 30 times to no avail (there's a Reddit forum about it). It's infuriating and the rest of the game is a complete waste since I can't pass one specific section.

Love the gun selection and the melee weapons. The gun reloading system is fine, but takes some practise to master the fast reload while in the sweet spot as to not having your gun jammed as a penalty.\n\nMy only complain would be when I reach out to grab a gun or weapon laying nearby, it shows the circle but does not always respond fast enough, which results in losing time and consentration while being surrounded by zombies.\n\nThe horde mode is a lot of fun and a great way to practise.

But if you have more than one headset... the cost could add up! I wish this was adapted to 4 player... This game is 9 stars...\n\nSo why not 10 stars? Well... I think the game \"cheats\" too often. In multi plyr game, the revolver malfunctions & jams even when you are not reloading. All weapons jam/malfunctions when you are overrun by Zs. For example, in \"Damned Canyon\" scenario, level 13 has the most weapon failures... Whenever the Zs overrun in this level, all ur weapons are useless... all the time. It is still fun up to the impossible level. The other scenarios do not seem to have this \"cheating code\" that stops progress.\n\nAlso, there is a small bug that does not let you drop a weapon when you are overrun. This is realllllly irritating. You can shake your \"hand\" and press/release the grip button several times... but the code in the game says \"no... your dead and we will not let you continue...).\n\nCompared to other VR games, this one has to be one of the best. The controls are very easy and work as you'd think. I also have used \"Onward\" the the controls in that game are very difficult.\n\nThis is my favorite game thus far (out of 34 games)...\n\nHelpful | 0", "Blackberry7616 days ago\nLove Replaying\n\nWhen it comes to replaying a game repeatedly, that would be Drop Dead.

Lets be honest, everyone does not want to draft an email.\n\nI do hope that they take into consideration adding more people to play the game together.

However there would be a lot of things that could make this game better 1) Improve the story. This game feels like the story is made because your in VR like the characters always right in your face and trying to make you be like woah VR but I dont like that, along with that the missions are pretty boring and repetitive 2) The Zombies, there are zombies with Goddamn jetpacks... It makes 0 sense and not just that but they shoot at you too.\n3) A more realistic zombie game would have been interesting to see.

It's just about averagely glitchy for the quest I find and has not crashed on me yet (a first!).\n\nThe devs do update the title and the price is very good.

Shooting zombies is always fun and doing it with a friend just makes it better. Shooting a zombie off your partner's back or nailing a rocket just before it hits him is definitely satisfying. Unfortunately multiplayer can also be frustrating due to a few bugs/clunky systems.\n\nConnecting in multiplayer is more difficult than it should be. I often have to invite several times or exit and restart the game before we connect. The game uses its own voice chat for some reason and it always drops out at some point in the session. I'm not sure why it doesn't just use the Oculus party chat which seems pretty bullet proof. It would also be nice if it automatically put us together in the game if we're in a party in Oculus rather than going through the whole invite system.

The multiplayer is just two persons, but you can't move anywhere together. You are stuck in a spot, and you aren't facing the same direction, so there is barely any ability to interact with the other player.\n\nThere are four levels, but they get boring quickly. Each level ramps up in difficulty, but it's not gradual. At a certain level the monsters become too powerful and just overwhelm, while the previous levels are easy.\n\nWhat should be changed:\n\n1. 4 player multiplayer.\n2. Levels where you fight as a team, facing the same direction.\n3. Make difficulty increase gradually.\n4. Multiplayer levels that allow players to move about freely. Imagine being holed up in the Alamo and fighting the hordes around you.\n5. More multiplayer levels in general. But without the cheap shot flying guys who hide behind a building and you can't shoot them. Sometimes they spawn in an area out of reach from either player and you have to abandon the game.\n6.

It could use at least 4 more hoard scenarios as playing the existing 4 scenarios begins to feel a little repetitive after a while, but it's still loads of fun regardless. There's plenty of satifaction in clearing zombies off your partner's back that she/he wasn't aware of. It would also be nice if there was some rail movement through the co-op hoard environments for a different perspective of your surroundings. Dual pistols would also add to the fun as dropped firearms aren't always available when you need them most. If you like pure shooters, buy this one. More hoard scenarios would have earned it 5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 1", "MossOnRock19 days ago\nUpdate cured the multiplayer issue.\n\nThe reason to buy a quest\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response19 days ago\n\nWe're really happy the issue is now resolved for you, thank you kindly for the review.", "splitscreener23 days ago\nHow is that patch coming along ?\n\nMultiplayer has major issues.\n\nEither we cant play together, cant hear each other or cant see our hands.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response19 days ago\n\nHi, once again we're really sorry for the issues you faced with our July 2020 update.

I get that the social features are closed off to me, but if I know a friend of mine is on at the same time as I am there should be a way for me to create a game and allow him to join...... That puts me off a bit and it is the reason I didn't give the game 5 stars. My friend just got a quest and this was the first game he bought and we can't play it together.

Once you get used to it and can nail it every time you'll find everything is much much easier! I find the game to be challenging, but not frustrating difficult. It is pretty much all fun from start to finish!\n\nThe one gripe I have about the gameplay has to do with collecting limbs. Missions require you to collect a certain amount of limbs in order to pass the mission and continue to the next. You collect limbs by shooting them off of the zombies that are attacking you. You don't get a limb if you score a head or heartshot tho.... It's cool and all but it makes using some guns difficult because they blow the enemy to smithereens....... it just feels like it prevents you from using all your power. I like headshots and firepower and I feel like the limb collection keeps me leashed to a degree.........but....at worst it is an annoyance....shooting the legs off an approaching zombie never really gets old! lol\n\nI think this is a really good game for new quest owners to start with.

The story mode is ok but nothing to be screamed about as is often the case with most games that are truly just designed for simple usage, in this case blowing zombies apart. Ive met some good people on this game playing horde mode past and present and its just such a simple game to jump into with someone to blow some zombies apart! I love how the waves of zombies get naturally more difficult as you progress and it presents such an amazing challenge! The physics of blowing the zombies up with a decent variety of weapons is also extremely satisfying!

The game isnt scary .. but the zombies can surprise you if your attention is somewhere else and they come at you from a different direction.

It takes forever to get specialized weapons and when you do you only get to use them for a short time. Second, the only good part, solo horde has some fun gunslinger aspects, but thats about it. I get it, 2 handed gun physics is hard to do on a quest, and Id be fine if they didnt. No, the problem is how they dont really have a zombie game. The only reason it could be called that is because of the graphics. Instead of say, playing co-op with your friends, grabbing two lMGS and firing them into an oncoming mob and frantically trying to survive as long as you can, the guns quickly, and I mean QUICKLY run out of ammo. I get it, you dont want people firing constantly, but oh my god, the have to at least double the ammo on most automatic weapons.\n\nFinally, the thing that I hate the most about this game, is how like I said up top, ITS NOT A ZOMBIE GAME. You dont die from a horde of zombies, you die from some zombie with a rocket launcher! I get it, its cartoonish, but corpses shouldnt be able to use ranged weapons. Thats it. If they doubled or tripled the zombie count, added more ammo, oh, and fixed the weapon grabbing system, and most of all, got rid of ranged zombies, maybe, maybe then it could get a 4 star review.

The best way to summarize this game would be to say its the made up, video game in a tv show or movie that was made up to avoid copyright. The game itself feels hollow, and the whole \"time traveling dna\" stuff was just an excuse to reuse assets and levels, to stretch the game out more than it should have. The gameplay isnt that fun either, and feels poorly planned out. For one, you have to hold down the grip button to hold a gun continiously, which not only makes your controller degrade faster, but is tiring as you hold your gun at all times when playing, it could just be a toggle, or just using a button to grab and ungrab it. And some of the \"challenging gameplay\" just isnt that well thought out. In the third timeline, you have to disarm various zombie virus bombs by matching symbols you see to symbols on the bomb. This wasnt challenging because of that, it was challenging because the symbols shown to you when you need to disarm a bomb is so close to your view that you have a hard time making out what the symbol is. Another overlooked design is the weapon change from a reliable, accurate, powerful revolver to a scattergun, which you want to give back in sections like the canyon, where you need to protect a civilian far away from closeby zombies. They die from a single bullet, and you cant snipe with a scattergun, its just luck if you dont hit a target that will instantly fail you. The gameplays all on the rails too, which while is a valid game design that can be done well, really just holds the game back, especially with melee combat. The game doesnt make up for this in characters or story either, as in the story, you're an ex zombie who gained \"TIME TRAVEL DNA\" from an experimental serum, whos just restarting their mission each time they reach a bad end, the entire fbi is now just 3 people including you under a barn, your partner was the villians lab assistant, who she calls a \"n*zi f*ck.\" Which i had to censor despite this being a mature game, espite no antisemetism really being spoken or anything, so either she calls german people nazis as an insult, or she worked with a nazi without an issue, and despite knowing where mondays lab is from previous timelines, you just repeat what youve been doing to \"find\" his base, and you go to a cellar to \"grab a shotgun\" that not only isnt able to be used outside of that level, but never even becomes a default weapon. Theres even characters saying stuff like your time dna is destabilizing, and youll need to keep time traveling to live, but nothings done with it and its just left there. The characters and jokes arent even likable either, as civilians will just yell obnoxious things like \"last time i listen to my wife\" or \"im too pretty to die.\" If i wanted to hear more about bad marriages id just go to facebook where \"wife bad\" is the only joke around.\n\nIts just dull, and doesnt feel like it has any feeling put behind it. If you just want a basic shooter game for vr, get this game on sale, but otherwise you have options. Though what do i know, im just an unread review complaining about a video game online, just using this as a dumping place to put my disatisfaction with this game.

The flaws shine through once you attempt the multiplayer experience though.\n\nMy friend and I bought this game knowing that there is an online co-op horde mode. The issues start occurring the moment one of us creates a lobby and the other person tries to join. Once the invited person joins they are booted out within a short time frame.

Timeline 3 decides to go a different direction and makes you type in the puzzle code to Zombbombs, this to me shows a lack of understanding the games identity by the programmers. For 2/3 of the game you are a shootem up zombie game and then you become a puzzle game at the end?

The game is easy to pick up and quickly become proficient to start climbing the leaderboards. I went in somewhat skeptical but for a $15 price tag and the possibility of a good multiplayer experience, it didnt take much convincing to make the purchase.

Plenty of replayability with different modes. Great to jump in and kill some stuff in order to destress... great for the price.\nEdit: I had to lower my review 2 stars for the same reason others mentioned...faulty weapon grab mechanic and annoyingly repetitive intro scenes.

I would call it action rather than horror though. It starts super easy and progressively gets harder as you go. Each level is broken up by a pause in the game with how well you did on that segment. This was initially annoying as the levels are fairly short, but after playing for a while it's nice having a good stopping point. Well worth the cost! Very few issues. One thing I noticed is picking up a weapon from a far is sometimes a little weird and can be annoying in combat. However I was playing in stationary mode and that may have effected it.

It isn't gimmicky (unlike many other VR games that banks on VR novelty) and the gameplay is actually fun. Reminded me of those days spent in the arcade playing Sega shooters, House of the Dead. Great fun.\n\nThe good stuff: movement is minimal but still immersive. i especially liked how you know which direction the undead are coming, as the dev included a subtle indicator that works and isn't distracting. I liked the aim system, where bullets leave a trail so you can gauge and correct your next aim. More VR shooters should follow this! and the reload system is well thought out. I really HATED those shooters where they force players to perform a \"real life\" reload where you need to eject existing clip from gun, then pick up a clip from the belt, then put said clip into gun, then cork the gun.... i mean, come on, who has time for that nonsense? its a game, and lets keep players feel good playing their games. not fumble to perform some silly ritual just to get their guns reloaded!\n\nThings to improve: i loved the idea of melee weapons. i'm a huge fan of the game Left4Dead on PC, and hitting undeads with melee is... satisfying. But the melee physics in this game needs improvements. for one, melee hits isnt always registered. many times my bat or pitchfork would run right through an undead, and no damage registered. i wish this can be fixed, and also perhaps add some kind of knockback or pushback when we strike with a melee weapon. make it feel real, add some vibration to the controllers too.\n\nOne last thing - please allow players to SKIP cutscenes!\n\nHelpful | 1", "woodbackFeb 19 at 3:28 AM\nGood fun\n\nThe game is fixed so apart from turning around theres no free movement.

Overall its worth the money and loads of fun. However the game messes up a lot. Playing co-op the 2nd player disappears a lot. They come back right away but not until the person left alone is killed. Your supposed to be able to pick up Guns dropped by zombies but many times the gun gets to your hand and disappears.

You have to time the reload correctly, so I understand the skill challenge, but having such a heavy penalty for reloading errors instead of putting focus on aiming or choosing the right weapon for the job makes for an odd distraction. Also, when you have to start collecting limbs, it runs counter to your improved accuracy. Instead of headshots, you now have to shoot legs. So a bit odd how the game fights itself.

In fact, the last game I owned was in the 80's. I played Pong on my Atari for hours. Needless to say times have changed! I purchased my Quest about 6 months ago and this is my first review after purchasing many games. Drop Dead was my first experience on VR. A friend introduced it to me and I immediately ran out and bought my own Quest and downloaded DD as soon as I got it. Since I had no experience with any of this I had nothing to compare it to.\n\nNow, back to present day. Now that I have purchased and played multiple games I can give an honest review. If you're not one of those elitist, fussy VR snobs who complains about everything you'll love this game. No, you can't teleport or walk in DD, but in my opinion it's nice to play an old school shooter, and this as good as it gets! The graphics are awesome and this game is stil one of my favorites even though I also have Arizona Sunshine and Death Horizon, both which I also love. The devs really put alot into DD and I have played it for more hours than I care to admit. Awesome weapons. Characters in the campaign become your friends. This game gives plenty of action and when you finish all 3 levels the horde maps are enough to keep it interesting for many hours! The multiplayer is my favorite. I can play with random people, which I haven't tried, or play with a friend, and it's highly addictive! I can hang out with my buddy and blast zombies on 4 horde maps! It would be awesome if the devs added some DLC and more horde maps but i'm not complaining.\n\nBottom line: BUY THIS GAME! The price is fair compared to most games. You get more than your money's worth! DD was my first purchase of about 2 dozen games and it remains a personal favorite which is why I finally broke down and wrote a review.

Its comical and very entertaining. Very impressive. The ONE aspect that prevented a five star rating was the Zombombs I did not like the diffusing of bombs whilst being attacked. I did stop playing several times just due to boredom/frustration with the zombombs\n\nHelpful | 4", "francisflzFeb 24 at 8:05 PM\nFinally found a Good Shootting game\n\nBest game so far in the oculus quest .\n\nHelpful | 1", "5RiDiCuLuSriZZ5Jan 14 at 3:08 PM\nGreat Bang for your Buck!\n\nArguably my favorite game on Quest - if youre going to go spend $40 plus on another Zombie game, Id save your money and just buy this.

GREAT and Immersive fun \n\nHelpful | 1", "KennyLogginsVIJan 5 at 1:53 AM\nQuite Good With a Couple of Issues\n\nMostly solid gameplay, great visuals for a Quest game.\nThis is the first Quest title I've played where my vision felt like a limitation though. I grew up with lazy eyes and they were corrected by training my brain to use one eye for long-sighted things and the other for short-sighted things.\nIn most VR shooters this isn't an issue, but in this specific title I found myself missing far more shots than other VR games.\nIf you have any eye conditions, I'd be wary of a purchase. It's still mostly playable but I certainly found it frustrating at more intense moments of the game.\nIt's also kind of annoying being unable to skip dialogue when replaying missions. The narrative is entertaining, but it gets irritating hearing the same sentences repeatedly while waiting to actually shoot things.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Big.DowdyJan 7 at 5:05 PM\nGreat Game\n\nHaving just got my quest recently this one one of my first game purchases and boy was I not disappointed.

A lot of fun to play, and the story line is complimented by the really fun Horde mode. In Horde mode instances where weapon reload does not work very well in later rounds which results in getting swarmed. Melee weapons would benefit form increased durability as they have the durability of discounted Dollar Store equipment. Would be fun to have an additional pistol as a double wield option. Overall, highly recommend the game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "joro0414Apr 15 at 6:50 AM\nPlaying inside the Zombie Arcade.\n\nSo many games/apps are a little over priced in the oculus store, but this game is a hidden gem, maybe unhidden gem. IDK? Im probably at around $275-$350 into games so far, only had my Quest for ~2 months. I dont usually care for the whole zombie genre, but wow, this game is really fun and at $15, I feel its underpriced for the entertainment value, not that Im complaining. Graphics are good, Xbox360/PS3 quality. The girl is a video game hottie. You will meet her early on.\nNo puzzles to figure out, at least so far anyway, just shoot, chop, punch, stab, and blast the living dead, back to dead,dead. All action and fun, even a good story so far. Better than most of my $30 games. Better then Beat Saber, but not as good as Vader Immortal.\n5 game for $15, oculus make more games with this star to price ratio.\n\nHelpful | 0", "yeetkidoooooApr 28 at 6:07 AM\nYaaaaaaaas\n\nIts action packed u can jump right in any time and start shooting there is co op multiplayer ,single player hords, and lastly the campaign it has multiple mission that can be challenging and fun love the game it is ssooo worth it.(:\n\nHelpful | 0", "TitanUpSonJan 3 at 10:19 AM\nBest VR game so far\n\nImagine your a kid again (I'm 34) and your at the mall arcade with a red gun in your hand shooting zombies pointing at the screen.......

What surprised me and sets this apart from other games in the quest library is its polish game play and snappy controls. Shooting feels almost natural with the go to revolver and its small assortment of guns. Theres plenty to like here in this cheap package, a horde mode that has optional multiplayer, a single player campaign that has a good amount of levels (even tho it's the same 10 sets with different challenges), dual wielding, and options for sitting or standing play. I have put more time into this title then beat saber (which I originally bought the quest for). This game definitely deserves future updates and continued support, I feel there are some things that could make this game better, 1- options for customizing horde mode like starting weapons and individual round by round zombie lineup 2- giving the player dual revolvers( I definitely would love to do this being that the revolver is fun to use) 3- add long range type rifles 4- add rewards for earning star ranks in missions like weapon attachments 5- finally weapon customization.

I have to furiously shake my hands in order for the game to reload them. This is HIGHLY aggravating in a zombie shoot 'em up. In the earlier levels, not a huge deal, but later it means the difference between moving on being stuck on a level. Once this has been fixed, I will re-review. This does not happen on any other game I have.\n\nHelpful | 2", "PackoAirsoftJan 26 at 1:44 AM\nObsolete\n\nThis game was quite fun when it I first bought it. The graphics are cartoony and the guns look good. I think the melee weapons are cool. This game is fun for a bit but gets repetitive and boring very quickly. Now with amazing games such as Arizona sunshine and walking dead saints and sinners out now there is no point in buying this game. If the game was priced a lot lower maybe under 5 I would consider it. Now I just wished I'd of saved my money and waited for a better game.

There's a light story and a surprising amount of content -- making it one of the best deals in the Quest library. For the campaign you get 15 levels, and then 3 separate timelines that cover all those levels - with narrative and spawn points tweaked between them. At this point the few initial bugs have been stomped out and the experience is very smooth.\n\nCo-op is of course, a blast... and if you're wondering what would put it over the top to make it a 5 star game, it would be that the Co-op is only possible in 4 distinct horde mode maps. While this is nice and certainly extends the value of the game even further, it hints that the campaign could be just as sweet with another player as well.\n\nAltogether a great game and i happily recommend to other players looking for a nice, lengthly arcade zombie fix (that um... you don't have to pay $40 for).\n\nPixel Toys - thanks for bringing us this game!

It has a campaign, horde mode, and a multiplayer option to play the horde mode with a friend. Its a lot of fun and the latency is usually pretty great, leading to some fun, challenging and frenetic games. It doesnt have graphics that are going to floor you, the gameplay mechanics are simple, but shooting feels very accurate and the replayability is high. Probably my favorite fun Quest shooter righ now.\n\nOnly complaint- Gripping the weapons off the ground, or particularly the pistol from your belt, can be tough at times. A lot of the time I have to press the grip twice to actually unholster my pistol.

Nothing too memorable, as the weapon library is really thin.\n- repeating generic zombies, however not unusual for zombie games.\n\nOverall: great game really nostalgic to the genres of rail shooters.

It can be impossible to get them most times as pointing at them is way too sensitive and you can't lock on.\n- The reload function is fine, but too many times the game doesn't recognize the gun is in the reload position.\n\nI've opened tickets for the above minor issues.\nIf you're on the fence about buying this game, get it!

I need to know this issue will be fixed soon otherwise its the good old Oculus refund route for me.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseNov 18 at 1:06 AM\n\nHi SauXS, Thanks for your feedback and I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue.

Thanks, Pixel Toys Support Team.", "LABSmith13Oct 5 at 12:15 PM\nGreat game with potential to be amazing\n\nZombies are what got me into Vr in the first place and this game does it justice. The mechanics work very well and it is very immersive, so much so that that my sister in law (who hates computer games) absolutely loved the experience.\n\nThe single player option is well set out (completed first pass), but the multiplayer is what is going to give this game longevity. I currently play with a friend on the rift and its great to catch up while playing. However, there needs to be an increase in maps, as the four currently, while fun, are starting to lose their draw. Itd be good to when a different level of challenge Option, as having to work through the first levels is more of a chore and itd be good to be able to be more on your toes from the beginning.\n\nWhen Arizona sunshine is released on quest, this game will either be established enough to survive or will be silenced, depending on what the developers do/release to counter this big title.\n\nOverall, a solid 4 stars, but it could easily be 5 with some additional content. Also theres a bug in multiplayer where if one player taps the release button while holding the gun, a team mate can make a copy of that weapon by grabbing it from their hand. This has certainly helped us on some levels, but needs to be fixed.\n\nHelpful | 1", "LupinSaikoDec 18 at 10:18 PM\nLow Performing Optimization & Narrative\n\nThis is a rough game. For those that dont know, the Quest can achieve forced FOVeated rendering so that only the things near the center of your eyesight are rendered at a normal resolution and the rest is low res. Normally, its not too noticeable, in this game its terrible. Even with this massive amount of FOVEATED rendering the performance is still terrible with the frame rate frequently stuttering making the whole experience feel subpar. The developers had a controlled platform and still put in too many effects to maintain a stable frame rate: poor job.\n\nThis might actually be forgivable but the hamfisted narrative in what is basically an on rails zombie shooting game is not something easy to look over. I dont care about your silly time travel plot or the CIAs involvement in Zombies. People arent buying this game for that and being forced to watch it before getting to the poorly performing gameplay is tantamount to torture.

The gameplay is fun and ramps up in difficulty at a suitable rate, keeping the player challenged but not overly frustrated as they progress. Weapon control can feel a little fiddly at times especially when you're under pressure and it gets annoying when you're trying to grab a grenade from your belt and you accidentally grab the empty shotgun you tossed away, again and again until you're suddenly dead (one star dropped here). The range of weapons and zombie types is varied and gives more dimension to the gameplay.

Recently purchasing the quest and being an owner of a regular Rift, I can be a bit picky about what to buy and having played games like Arizona Sunshine, I didnt expect much out of this game. I figured its only 14.99, I loved Carnevil and HotD and I can refund if Im disappointed. I can say that this is easily one of my favorite games on the quest. Cons-grab function can be a bit finicky and have had several glitches on the lab level where a zombie with a pickaxe gets stuck trying to come through the door (please fix this part). Have also had an occasional black screen in multi-player. Also, wish I could skip some intro dialogue on levels Ive beaten. Pros- I love the gameplay so much. The axe is fun to use, the challenge is ramped up at an even pace, and multiplayer horde is surprisingly fun.

When this happens progress is not lost though, and when I go back into the game I continue from where I left off.\n\nOther negative is the cutscenes. The story is great and all, but I don't want to have to stand around waiting to get to the action as I re-watch what Ive already seen each time I die or want to replay a level.

Amazing back to back co op horde mode, but too few of those maps right now and there is no movement allowed in the arenas. Great with a friend tho the difficulty ramps up a little too quickly and I find myself wanting to plead with the devs right now to please make the missions co op, but maybe thats asking a lot on this system, I dunno.

I was on the fence about purchasing this game because of the reviews complaining about the size of the play area. The thing that made me go ahead and buy this game was a reply to one of the reviews by the devs claiming that they \"greatly increased the play area in which you're allowed to now move in inside the game\". Imagine my surprise when I load the game up and take one little shuffle to the left to center myself inside the guardian and I'm met with a \"please return to the play area\" message. This game is hardly a roomscale experience and the only reason I bought it is because of the developers false claims of roomscale integration.\n\nThe idea (in Horde mode) is that you stand there as loads of zombies pop out of the ground to attack you. Now as I've just finished drawing a guardian around my entire living room to battle zombies, it makes zero sense and ruins the immersion for me to be forced to have my feet planted in one spot. The whole time I'm playing the game I can't stop myself from thinking \"why the heck wouldn't anyone just move out of the way...\" There is no storyline reason that you have to stand there and it just seems like laziness or incapability on the developers behalf. Maybe if this game wasn't the price that it is, I wouldn't be upset. Or if the devs weren't lying to us in the replies to sucker more people in to buying a game that they're already being told needs improvements to reach potential.\n\nAside from my main gripes, the gameplay is repetitive and boring and there could be way better implementation of features. Magically grabbing items from across a field or behind a building is just lazy and would be solved if you guys take the time to add some kind of locomotion in the game. Or just stop lying to people and market this as a seated/standing game. Melee would be way more fun with locomotion as standing in one spot waiting for zombies to get to you is annoying and breaks the immersion for me as well. You can barely move to dodge spit from the spitters. If these issues are addressed I will consider changing my rating, but for lack of integrity and the greed of the price point I have to one star this game\n\nHelpful | 7", "guardzeroMay 26, 2019 at 6:43 AM\nAmazing Experience on the Quest!!\n\nI have had quite a lot of fun with this game in both regular game and multiplayer.

Today finally I played multi survival mode with my friend in a same room right next to each other. It was like a dream come true. 2 things I really want to ask to the developers.

I've never played vr before this. It's amazing. I found as a first timer I'm quite prone to motion sickness after playing a roller-coaster game but this game hasn't made experience any of that. There are a couple of levels that move you along smoothly and I didn't feel sick once. The gameplay is fun and the colours are bright. I hit what I was targeting and never did I feel the guns weren't following my movements. It's a fun game and honestly I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do. My only slight gripe is I haven't yet been able to play online multiplayer as I haven't had any success in joining a lobby.

It becomes boring to go through first easy waves in every multiplayer game and they still take lots of time, I'd prefer to be able to jump into action faster, or maybe difficulty could be adjusted so that even at first levels zombies would be faster and there would be more of them depending on how you're performing\nIt would also be nice to have more maps, 4 maps is just not enough\nStanding in one place also gets boring... Teleportation between predefined location in-between waves could make the game a lot more interesting, especially if players could take different locations\nAnd I don't know if the game supports more than 2 players at the moment, but I'd love to play 3-4 people games with friends\n\nHelpful | 2", "missourimedicJul 8, 2019 at 6:29 PM\nVery Polished and Fun!\n\nDefinitely one of the more polished games available for Quest.

Throwing an axe at a zombie, then force grabbing it back and dismembering the next one makes you feel like a superhero.

Has horde mode as well. Zombies jumping from above has great tracking and it always feels nice to crack a zombie melon with an axe. On the nitpick side, reloading can be a little difficult at times but i guess if it was too easy to reload maybe the game difficulty would be too easy. Maybe could increase the bounds by a little that the player can move in the future, but still, this is a minor issue. Overall its just a great title. Only tried single player so far. Keep coming back to this game/drop dead, robo recall and superhot. All worth the purchase IMO.\n\nUpdate: Great update by the developers. Noticeably better than before and before was awesome. Using other weapons like axes, etc feels much smoother and cooler (and easier to pick up at distances and reuse quickly) and the use of the weapons like main gun/shotgun from reloading to holstering area are better (and I had to play with lefty only due to a right/dominant arm injury). Even if zombies arent your thing the game mechanics make the game worth the purchase if you like shooters. Must buy game and perfect example of developers listening to their audience and acting quickly to make some great improvements on a game that was already 5 stars.\n\nUpdate remix: went through more solo horde modes and did multiplayer with some rando and game just gets better and better. Back to back with a buddy against a 360 horde with weapons galore is epic. How does someone not rate this game 5 stars?! Its 6 stars for the cost and I kinda question the reviewers expectations when they rate it lower than 5 stars.

I love to play but I sometimes get frustrated and turn it off because of the reload. Its touchy and it will cause you to die. Doesnt always read you are trying to reload so you have to do it several times and on the faster paced levels it will get you killed. Game is awesome itself but for such a key part to not function right takes a lot away. The fun part is killing zombies so reloading should not take much thought or effort. If every time I even kind of pointed down it reloaded this would be a 5 star game because the game itself is what vr should be but its playability suffers from bad reload mechanics. Awesome game!!... now make reloading easier!!\nEdit : I do have some problems with picking up items but to me the reload is more of an issue\nEdit2 : once you get into timeline 2 picking up items, reloading, storing items in your belt, using items in your belt becomes a jumbled mess... frustration is mounting\n3 : Im tempted to take away another star. To make the game harder they give you increasingly worse primary guns and then expect you to defuse bombs while being attacked while you play through the same levels over and over. Too bad this game has high potential\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nPost update review: I added a star because I finally got multiplayer to work. Im in the u.s. and I played with someone from u.k. and we were high fiving with our machine guns, telling each other when a zombie dropped a weapon. Picking up guns was no problem. This is what I expected from vr... probably more. I will bump up to 5star if the single player has been fixed which I suspect it is. Anyway Ill probably stick to multiplayer.

Hopefully the developers will be able to fix the spotty telekinesis as it is the only thing that somewhat holds this game back.\n\nHelpful | 3", "BigJohn_Jul 29, 2019 at 5:01 PM\nSo much fun\n\nI've loved this game since gear vr.

I do not understand the purpose of a gun malfunction. (Your gun shuts off or whatever. Happens when you shoot too quickly as you reload) Yeah I guess I can see that it tries to make this game a challenge, but I dont see it that way at all. Its so unnecessary and annoying.\n\n2. The life bars. About 5-6 hits, and you immediately lose. I wouldnt really see this as a problem if there was no gun malfunction feature. But since there is that feature, it just makes things way more complicated than it should be. The game doesnt really explain to you how to fix the gun malfunction in the tutorial. If your going to make zombies come at you at an alarming rate during the gameplay, why would you make it so annoying with a gun malfunction a___a\n3. The restarts. It would be great if this game had checkpoints instead of restarting from the VERY BEGINNING. With all the features i explained above, restarting is the most frustrating thing. I end up just tossing the headset and delete the game off from my VR, and plan to ask for a refund.\n\n4. This one isnt really a big deal, it just annoys me. I kind of hate how you cant really control what weapon you have. All the guns/melee weapons are temporary. The game controls what weapons you will use during the game. They work for a couple of minutes, and then they force you to get a different weapon in the next obstacles. Just seems too much. You dont really play freely.\n\n\n\nAnyways, love the graphics and the story line. This game kind of reminds me of playing games at the arcade.\n\nHelpful | 4", "BlazerDuckJul 17, 2019 at 9:45 PM\n\nThis is simply the best FPS game on the Quest right now.

For me personally, I've had a ton of fun with this already, haven't even played multiplayer yet. My biggest issue is that as I show off the headset to friends, it takes a little too much explaining to get my friends to pick up and play. It's odd to have to hold the middle finger button to grab a gun from the holster, perhaps a quick fix is if you fire with an empty hand, it picks up your gun for you. Many friends/family have died today mashing triggers unable to get the gun in a panic. Reload might be better on a button. i have zero issues myself with the control scheme, but it confused my friends. I mean this totally constructively, trying to offer perspective of novices to this crazy unfamiliar world of VR.

The auto-movement works well enough and 3D models are as good as roughly Quake III, but the smooth-as-silk frame rate makes up for any complaints about graphics quality. Blowing off body parts is very satisfying. I can't quite get axe throwing right either; the axes often go too low, but it's neat when you fetch it back and it chops off the leg of someone. Also interesting is how you can poke your gun through the top part of a shield right in front of you and kill the zombie holding it. I've had issues getting the ammo reload to work every time.

Drop Dead plays very similarly with the added intensity that only VR can provide.\nDrop Dead was one of my favorite games on the Oculus Go, so even if it had been a straight port, I wouldn't have considered it a waste. Luckily just about everything in the Quest version has been upgraded to take advantage of the new hardware.\nThe ability to hold two guns at once and use melee weapons changes the game play in a very satisfying way. With the added advantage, more enemies were added with way more zombies on screen at a time.\nThe graphics have also noticeably improved over the Go version.

The gameplay is beautiful, the aiming and throwing is incredibly accurate, and the overall experience is brilliant. If you want to get the full experience of VR, you should DEFIANTLY get this game. Its so worth it for $15 (which is very cheap, most games of this quality are $30).\n\nWith that being said theres one somewhat massive flaw that took it from a perfect score... which is you having such a SMALL play arena. I have a huge area where I play but if you even get within a foot of the end of your play area the ENTIRE screen goes blank and you cant see anything until you move back closer. With a game like this where its so intense a split second can kill you and you are constantly spinning around having your screen go completely blank is a guaranteed death for you. This needs to be fixed, and I truly hope it will. I understand letting someone know you are getting close to the edge of your play area or outside of the pre-determined area set by the game but theres absolutely no reason for the entire screen to go blank... one simple pop up will do letting you know to move closer to your play area or re-adjust with your Oculus home button is all thats needed and this is how most games are set. Please fix this!\n\nI would still highly recommend this game... my buddy and I played and it was some of the most fun weve ever had and experienced on any gaming platform and it was just a huge bonus with it being VR.

I thought was the second chapter of the game, not the same game I already completed on Oculus Go. Well, Im playing it again from the beginning, honestly the go version looks now like playing a 90s version of the game, and here you can use both hands! Ahem.. to be honest I never use both, but its a nice addition isnt it? :D\nI had to take 2 stars from my review: the game often get back to oculus home, I have to start the game again which fortunately was suspended, so I get back exactly where I was but thats frustrating nevertheless, I hope this will get fixed:)\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 30, 2019 at 2:06 AM\n\nHey nnsense, we're sad to hear about the issues you're having with being sent back to Oculus home and would like to help resolve this for you (and reclaim our mighty two stars!) please could you send an email to support@pixeltoys.com and we'll pick up from there :)", "MaMonroeJun 10, 2019 at 6:00 AM\nAwesome\n\nLove it.

This is likely due to the Facebook server issues that the platform has been experiencing since last night and into this morning.

Please try again and re-consider your review as this was out of our hands :) we hope to see you and your friend destroying some Z's in multiplayer! Update: Could you please ensure that your notification opt out preferences are set correctly and try again, \"friend activity\" blocks room invites by default from the Oculus side.

But when trying to cross play with my brother, Theres no way for me to add him as the game is tied to one account (despite there being 2 Separate VR sets).\n\nIf somebody knows how to fix this please help is appreciated.\n\nHelpful | 394\nDeveloper ResponseJun 3, 2019 at 2:17 AM\n\nHi patrrickk, This is not a Drop Dead Dual Strike issue, this is how cross buy works for all games on the platform. You don't get 2 copies of the game you get 1 copy that works on both devices. To clarify you get a copy for Rift and Quest for a single account. We are sorry for the misunderstanding and for your frustration. As this is out of our control we'd ask that you reconsider your review.
