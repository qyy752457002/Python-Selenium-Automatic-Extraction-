The background need to go black when video start or have different rooms or skins to watch in. Would be nice if you can control the tv size from normal to huge and great if you can do a 4 video split screen.\n\nHelpful | 45", "JasonIElderSep 15, 2019 at 7:48 PM\nTv provider\n\nWell download ESPN and I click on my tv service and it shows it but I cant log it in and says I must have a subscription and I have espn on my tv service\n\nHelpful | 27", "obi2kenobiMay 26, 2019 at 8:23 PM\nCool way to watch ESPN\n\nMight have to try this for next sporting even I am interested in. TV is basically the size of the wall. Might be better than my 48\" Vizio.\n\nObviously, you have to provide TV provider info to access it...\n\nInterface was easy and intuitive. Best video app for me so far.\n\nHelpful | 22"]
