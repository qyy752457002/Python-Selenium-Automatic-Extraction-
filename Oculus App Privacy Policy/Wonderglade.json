Play each game to unlock golden tickets to purchase in-game collectibles for your avatar but after my first impressions video I feel its overpriced for the content. 5/$7 would of been more acceptable in my mind. Possible one to check out in a sale \n\nHelpful | 35", "jonesq17 days ago\nContains a ridiculously stupid flaw\n\nI bought this game for my child but I wanted to check it out first so I played it for a while. It was OK, but apparently there is no way to reset your game play back to the beginning. Not sure how the developers could be so idiotic not to include such feature.\n\nHelpful | 5", "liam.banas476Jul 11 at 4:08 PM\nI like it but its more of a one time\n\nIts a fun game but it is a game that I only like playing 1 time and then its not that fun\n\nHelpful | 13", "SwitchStopJul 13 at 9:54 AM\nWii Sports Of VR\n\nThe best way to show off your Quest to someone who is unfamiliar with VR.
