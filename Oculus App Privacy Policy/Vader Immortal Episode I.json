I was 7 when the first Star Wars came out and i never couldve imagined that a mere 40+ years later, Id get to play a part in such a fantastic Star Wars experience. Sounds corny but it really feels like youre face to face with Darth Vader .. and hes as intimidating and intense as we all expect him to be. The graphics are fantastic. Id recommend spending considerable time in the Dojo to allow you to get really comfy with battling with a lightsaber. If you let yourself get immersed, you wont regret it. I have a GOOOOD feeling about this. :)\n\nHelpful | 395", "MichaelHibbettsJun 26 at 10:21 AM\nYoull be amazed how much fun you have!\n\nJust got my Oculus, and I had to try this. Like everyones review, yes this is short. Takes about 45 minutes to an hour to get through. For $9.99, its perfect. All three episodes will set you back $29.97. The story is great, especially if youre a Star Wars fan, and even if youre not, its still exciting. Found replaying this more than once was still enjoyable. I would love seeing other Star Wars experiences in the future.\n\nHelpful | 51", "brett_dJul 4 at 5:59 PM\nSuper fun.\n\nStory is short, 40 mins or so but the dojo is hours of fun. The climb in the first part is nerve wracking but well worth it.\n\nI was most impressed by the accessibility of the game, there are options for seated, reducing the opponents to 180 deg, left handed controls, audio options, skip climbs, reduced motion (shakes etc).\n\nHelpful | 23", "lamahunter3 days ago\nMASTER  PIECE \n\nThere is nothing more I can say than \"WOW\" I would love to say I played through the game distraction free but but a Lightsaber in two floating hands and that's a recipe for distraction. Anyways love it. Worth way more then the price point. Best series on the occlusion quest to date.\n\nHelpful | 1", "bigmickiJul 26 at 8:44 PM\nBest star wars gaming experience\n\nThis game is perfect in every way except being too short, but it's still worth every penny.If you are a star wars nerd, this experience is a must have for you, and, Even if you are not a star wars fan, the experience that this game provides will be 100% your money's (and time's) worth in my opinion.\n\nHelpful | 7", "Ayeandus15 days ago\nOne of the overall best OQ games\n\nLooks good, good story, fun game play graphics actually look current and not 10 years old like most of the games so far. Its short and ultimately 30 bucks but if you want an impressive experience this will do especially if you love star wars. Even with a few issues it still shines.\n\nHelpful | 3", "ryanscullin7 days ago\nBest Quest Title\n\nIf you have a Quest, buy this. It looks as good as many of the best PCVR and also has a good variety of solid gameplay.\nIf you are a Star Wars fan you of course need to play this as well. Something about seeing Vader and other Star Wars characters in front of you in 3D with realistic proportions and scale is really incredible.\n\nHelpful | 0", "rockwithtime3 days ago\nWouldnt buy myself but Very fun\n\nIm not a huge star wars guy but regardless i still had fun playing. Personally i wouldnt spend the money on this because im not that into star wars. The series came with my quest purchase and im happy it did. If you like star wars and are intrested in this game i recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Ivab_9 days ago\namazing\n\nthis may not appeal to some but for me it was hours of fun trying to beat all the lightsaber dojo levels the story was amazing too i havent even played episode II or III but im sure they will live up to the same standard\n\nHelpful | 1", "GreenFordPintoMay 30 at 9:07 AM\nLike living inside a Star Wars movie\n\nEpisode One is the real deal. You will be transported from your bedroom to planet Mustafar, where the surface is covered with rivers flowing with lava. There you will learn how to use a light saber to deflect laser gun fire and battle with light saber wielding robots.\n\nThis is a great experience where you can sit through most of it. The only time youll need to get up is during the light saber battles b/c some of your enemies come from behind.\n\nYou can use your controllers to move through the environments so that it feels like youre walking through the Darth Vaders fortress. There are a few places where you can just stop and admire the environment, but most of the time one of the characters prompts you to keep following them. But if you want the best experience just follow the intended pace of the experience because it allows for best immersion.\n\nYou can go back into the game another time and just sit outside the fortress to admire the volcanic landscape.\n\nThis is a good experience for newbies to VR because your sidekick robot voiced by Maya Rudolf gives suggestions like hit the buttons on the hyper drive, while youre standing near a panel of switches.\n\nBut I do think it is aimed at those who are at a minimum a casual gamer because you will have to fight using a light saber and that requires fulling committing to a battle in virtual reality. It really looks like someone is about to slice you wide open with a saber.\n\nIm a 55 year old casual gamer who started with the 8-bit Nintendo NES, and its amazing to see how far video games have come.\n\nHelpful | 50", "mrdawgmanlol10 days ago\nThe whole family enjoys the game!!!\n\nI have played this game myself many times. It is a great game for all the Star Wars fans out there. I showed my family the game and they loved it! Even the non Star Wars fans will like this game. I even bought the whole series! If you get an oculus device, this game is a must play!\n\nHelpful | 0", "nnaytonJul 20 at 2:23 PM\nVery Immersive\n\nThis was a really enjoyable game and fun to replay. If you are a star wars fan then this is a dream game, if not then you will still enjoy. Definitely top 5 games in my opinion, you feel like you are on a true adventure. If you are looking for a fun story game then I would 100% recommend.\n\nHelpful | 2", "SithbotApr 14 at 9:45 AM\nAmazing but short\n\nI love Star Wars. My friends joke I have a 24/7 loop of it running through my head, and this was the closest Ive ever been to being immersed in that universe. From being able to send my ship into light speed to dueling with a lightsaber, this was everything I hoped it could be. The small drawback is that it is an incredibly short experience (maybe a half hour at most), but its worth the price of admission and something I will go back and experience again and again.\n\nHelpful | 279", "ConorMullins21 days ago\nI believe this is the first vr star wars\n\nIf so, then I'm impressed. The story is captivating, to say the least. Lightsaber combat is amazing, and Mustafar is, to quote the game, \"Beautiful. Well, beautiful for a giant hellscape.\" I should also mention that the dialogue and voice acting are superb. Overall, I recommend this game to everyone with an Oculus Quest. It may not be my favorite vr game in existence, but it is still one of the best oculus exclusives for the Quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Ihrie3 days ago\nShowed promise\n\nSort of a retrospective on the first episode as Ive already played all three of them and it is sadly still the best of the three.\n\nI would say get all three if youre a diehard Star Wars fan, or if you just feel like it might be a fun experience. Just realize that its sorta down hill from here IMO. They never really bad chapters 2 or three but they dont really live up to the stage the first one set.\n\nI will again stated how much I dislike them being three separate games as opposed to say one game with episodes of DLC. There wasnt a lot of consideration to how much space all three episodes will take up on somebodys Quest IMO.\n\nHelpful | 0", "MaulerManny23 days ago\nThank you - thank you so much\n\nPerhaps this is colored by the fact that this wasnmy first VR game or that I am such a Star Wars geek that I'd play Star Wars Monopoly just for the thrill. This was by far the most immersive experience in the Star Wars universe for me. Perhaps a veteran VR user can nitpick on the level of interaction, refresh rate, detail, etc. I will not. I was too busy being in Star Wars. This is better than the Disney World exhibit - and costs less too.\n\nHelpful | 0", "RoreoOreo10 days ago\nAmazing\n\nI have played all the games in this series and they were all amazing. I started playing this series after I got pretty settled into vr and yet it was so amazing I dont even like Star Wars that much would definitely recommend\n\nHelpful | 0", "chrisnub23 days ago\nA Must Have\n\nVader immortal was the first game I picked up when I got the quest. Experiencing Vader standing right in front of you is truly an amazing experience, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Even though the story mode itself is not that long, I have gotten my moneys worth doing the Dojo mode.\n\nHelpful | 1", "KidDoc998 days ago\nFun but needs more risk\n\nWell worth the $10 and I plan to buy the next episodes. VR feels great overall with good environment interaction, good voice acting, good graphics.\n\nMy only complaints are:\n1) Lack of Risk- it seems like getting hit with sabers or lasers basically does nothing. I still fought and tried but I may try it again and see what happens if you just stand there and get beat up.\n2) I am not a fan of the teleport movement style, prefer steps.\n\nHelpful | 0", "TsquareVR628 days ago\nExcellent graphics, too short game play\n\nHey like a lot of reviewers I concur that the graphics are phenomenal and the Star Wars atmosphere is spot on, but right up front I have to say why split this game up into three $10 purchases. Make it one complete 3 (short )episode game for say $24.00 and youd have a real must have VR game on your hands. Just sayin\n\nHelpful | 0", "surfnscubamike8 days ago\nIf you love Star Wars\n\nThis is a must have if you love Star Wars! It puts you right into the Star Wars universe! Everything about this game is freakin awesome! (Note to developers) please please do more Star Wars! You guys nailed it!\n\nHelpful | 0", "cheyn04 days ago\nGood showcase for vr bit pricey though\n\nI would probably wait for a sale for these as they are short demo type be showcases not really a game.\nVery nice visual quality but it's an interactive demo. If this was half the price of rate 5 stars but for $15 you can't really say it's good value.\n\nAnd I love star wars.\n\nHelpful | 0", "JenspadJul 29 at 4:25 PM\nThis is the magic of VR!\n\nVader Immortal is what VR is all about this is what sucked be into what is now my addiction to the Quest and virtual reality. Let me first say that this is just part 1 of 3 of a complete game and I think it should have been sold as one game but at the end of the day it really doesn't matter as long as you know to purchase all 3 and play them in order. To date there is nothing on the Quest that compares to this. I grew up on Star wars and I cannot begin to describe the feeling you get when you are looking up at Darth Vader and he is talking to You! You are part of the story you are the star and although this is not an intense battle game that you have to \"Beat\" that is irrelevant because you want to stop and take in the environment and enjoy everything around you. If you want a shooter or a saber battle the dojo offers that as well so for those who rated this low or said it was boring you are completely crazy its obvious how much detail talent effort and time has been put into this. Can't wait for Galaxy's edge!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Darkspaceinvader10 days ago\nA measured review\n\nVisually the game looks incredible. Easily some of the best graphics on the system.\nThe sound quality is equally stellar. Overall, the presentation of the menus and the artwork of the scenery and characters is all very polished. There's a but coming...\nThe problem is it's a game that has been broken into three parts that you must buy and load separately: they can never be joined into one seamless experience.\n\nIf the developers had made this as one complete game and charged $25-29 I would've bought it. As it is I'll just stick with episode one and forego the other episodes. Episode 1 offers a fun introduction into the world plus a training Dojo which offers replay value. The storymode is visually stunning but not well written enough to entice me to buy the other episodes and have the hassle that that entails.\n\nIf you're looking for a great looking Star Wars showcase (or just a showcase in general) for your Quest then buy this episode: it looks cool and while it's only got a short story, the training Dojo is replayable and fun.\n\nHelpful | 0", "lethal-hamJul 28 at 1:01 PM\nWhaaaaaaaaat!...\n\nI love it every single episode is perfect the graphics are great the story is amazing I got my oculus quest like 5 weeks ago I could one series of a game or one game and when I saw Vader immortal I instantly bought the series it was a brand new adventure to me. p.s i love the light sword. Another p.s. you cant make a Star Wars game without Darth Vader .\n\nHelpful | 0", "Z3roKILLZ11 days ago\nA few adjustments and this could be 5*\n\nFirst Id like to say that the game is very well polished and for a VR game I was pretty impressed.\n\nOne note I want to make that was kind of frustrating was the combat. There was no way to move around during the combat to Dodge attacks or to dodge blaster fire. You were forced to stay in one place and use your light saber to defend yourself.\n\nConsidering that a lot of people have the space to play with a quest and are not doing standing room only this does take away from the VR experience.\n\nI would also not disable the light saber during the scenes and allow for some more creative and fun gameplay.\n\nThe visuals are amazing, and considering this is on the quest I was very impressed.\n\nHelpful | 0", "X_Sudey13 days ago\nAmazing game\n\nCompared to other quest games this is the most realistic graphics and makes me feel like Im in Star Wars. Everything is great except Vader feels like he loves KFC. I would 100 percent play another VR Star Wars series.\n\nHelpful | 0", "MiningMine0Jul 27 at 2:56 AM\nShort yet immersive and fun story.\n\nThe story of this game is great, I personally loved the beginning and seeing how star wars ships looked form the inside. It's also amazing seeing Darth Vader in person as his tall stature towers above you. Lightsaber combat is great and taught me why spinning your lightsaber cannot deflect blaster shots (Unless your general grievous). But what I should be talking about is the Lightsaber dojo. Hours upon hours of fun. Deflect numerous blaster shots. Strike down robots with Lightsabers, unlock different Lightsabers and teachings, and simply teabag your enemies whilst blurting out Obi Wan Kenobi Quotes. If you're a star wars fan, buy this game (and all the others that come after it, because in those I think you get to use the force).\n\nHelpful | 1", "sheikramsesJun 14 at 5:39 AM\nThe Dojo beats the story\n\nI enjoyed this introduction to an episodic story. But the real gem is the Dojo.\n\nThe story I alone I would have given 3 and a half Stars however the dojo bumps it to a solid 5.\n\nMy criticism of the story is that there is a singular path through which you get railroaded. The visuals are great, the experience is great but you have no choice as to how you proceed.\n\nHelpful | 7", "BAMFDez00719 days ago\nAwesome! Just a bit short\n\nThis series is awesome! They just go by quick... I do hope they keep it up and maybe add more gameplay per episode. \nSide note: The adjustable settings for motion control do the trick! No motion sickness and smooth gameplay.\n\nHelpful | 0", "software-is-artApr 19 at 9:29 PM\nBest Star Wars Experience\n\nTL;DR - Its like a Star Wars theme park ride in your house that you can play whenever with no lines.\n\nFirst of all, the main story line is an experience - not a game. Its purposely designed to not break immersion with game over screens and retries.\n\nThis has lead to some reviews complaining that this is far too easy, but they have missed the point of the narrative driven experience.\n\nNow, for a higher skill threshold game like feel there is also The Dojo (an arcade style series of 40 challenges).\n\nThese are punishing to achieve the highest rank on all levels, and provides the closest experience to feeling like a Jedi trashing hordes of droids.\n\nThe attention to detail in the sound effects, and the texture details of the lightsabers are phenomenal and I regularly spend time just looking at the models up close and listening to the sound effects.\n\nIts really that good and I really commend the attention to detail the VFX team put in.\n\nHelpful | 82", "zenjim6 days ago\nThis is why I bought the oculus\n\nRecently I came across an ad for this game and being a Star Wars fan I wanted it. So I bought the Quest and this game and was not disappointed. Very fun and immersive.\nLove it!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Rhysy2Jul 27 at 2:25 AM\nCome for the story, stay for the dojo\n\nMy first purchased game for the Quest - not disappointed ! Right from the start, feeling like you're actually in a Star Wars ship that's about to make the jump to hyperspace... what more could you want ? Hugely immersive all the way to the finish. It must be said that this is more of an interactive story than a game, but it's none the worse for that - largely because the story itself fits the Star Wars universe perfectly, and also because this is extremely well designed for the space limitations of VR. Nice graphics, perfect performance, tremendous fun.\n\nThe story is short, but the training dojo is certainly not. 40 addictive levels of lightsaber duelling with training droids of progressively higher skill. I'm on level 39 after lord-knows how much time and I'm still totally enthralled by it. Because, well, you get to hit stuff with a lightsabre, and that just never gets old... you even need to listen to determine where the next attack is coming from. The story has replayability, but the dojo is something I've taken to using as daily exercise (probably because I'm not very good at it, so I end up doing all kinds of crazy twister-like moves just to not die). I end up sweating profusely and enjoying every second of it.\n\nAbsolutely worth $10. Just be aware the story mode, while excellent, doesn't last very long. Unless you're the only Star Wars fan in existence who doesn't enjoy hitting stuff with a lightsabre, though, I assure you that that isn't going to matter.\n\nHelpful | 1", "lwd1074 days ago\nAwesome!\n\nYou have know idea how awesome it is to look Vader in the eyes until you do it.

I was fully immersed the whole time and when i tried the pcvr version after i didnt notice much difference beside better lighting ( the pcvr version was also way darker dunno why)\n\nAlso yes its awfully short but i dont think you should see it as a standalone game.

Iwas exactly what I expect out of a VR Star Wars experience. My main issue, and the reason why I only gave 4 stars, is the story mode itself took me 20 minutes, and about half of that time was listening to the characters talking and not doing anything. Though each episode is only $10, I probably wont be getting other episodes because Id like the game to be a bit longer. But the Jedi training module is also fun, and perhaps that was meant to be their emphasis in the game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Cheesecurls122719 days ago\nLove it!\n\nI really appreciate the work they put in to make the story canon.

However there are 2 bugs that make the game near unplayable. Theres this bug that makes your turning all weird which will send you the opposite direction sometimes and sometimes wont and it makes it impossible to turn without physically turning. Another bug is in certain sections itll tell you to go back to play space even if youre in it and the only way to get back is by going through what seems like a maze of physically walking towards what it considers your play space in that area. This is especially apparent in certain areas where some walls arent solid and seemingly teleport away from the section outside the wall,in climbing sections when you reach the top of the climb and during the beginning of the game in the ship.

Navigation is frustrating; while you can teleport, there's always a fade to black in-between locations. Also, you are not free to go where you want in the 360 space; only where the game wants you to go. The game basically hold you by the hand until the conclusion of this first part.

Visually it's nice, but I have a few gripes. It doesn't put you eye to eye with people you would be speaking to. I'm looking down at them, hovering above. This makes Vader much less imposing when he looks like he's a foot and a half shorter than you.\n\nIt's nice they got the real deal voice. This part of the 3 part VR series sets up a story to play through, but just that's where the actual lack of gameplay hinders this.\n\nThis portion of this mini series is very orchestrated. Follow a very narrow path, climb some ladders, get lightsaber and go through a pretty soft tutorial (which is unneeded with the available dojo anyways), have literally three mini battles. The battles are very one-on-one, quite the opposite of a game like Pistol Whip. Then as the story starts to get exciting, this part is done and it just feels like an upsell to keep playing.\n\nThe fights have you locked to a spot on the floor, unable to move on the screen (the opposite of Robo Recall, for example). Gameplay felt clunky, there are definitely more fluid games out there that I have mentioned in this review.\n\nProbably something neat to show new to VR people as the controls are very simple, the dojo may have some minor replayability, but this would be a demo or $2.99 \"game\" if not connected to Star Wars.

Even forewarned you just feel like you are getting going and then the game ends.\nPossible solution would be to combine all 3 episodes so the game is a decent length?\nWhile I liked the game, I won't be paying for the next mini installment for another 15-20 minutes of play time.

Its a good experience for a single play through but i don't see myself playing this game again. Also it is not properly optimized for the quest I have crashed 4 times playing through the game it was kinda upsetting. Also force abilities are kinda janky to use and some times i will block an attack and the attack will go right through my saber and hit me.\n\nThere are a bunch of glitches and my last complaint is thatvit gives u fake freedom. Everything feels stiff and on rails completely. It lets u walk around but only to the next spot where the game will freeze you in place to fight I was hoping to run around using my abilities and fighting enemies but no. Also there are times where i also just move my body to the left or right when im around nothing and the game will black everything out and tell me im inside an object when im not.\n\nAs for the story it felt kinda dumb but also cool. Most of the story consists of you being told \"BRO YOU GOTTA GET THIS [Important story item] OR WE ARE ALL GONNA DIE\" Then u run through to the next room and repeat. You never have a clue where u are going or why and the only real good parts of the story are when vader or your first mate is on screen with you.\n\nI had fun but its definitely not a polished game and feels like it was rushed out for the oculus i don't see why people are giving this almost perfect scores like sure its fun the 1st playthrough but my overall experience has been less than that of a score 4 there are better games to play than this but it makes me wish we could get a real good vr star wars game like maybe a star fighter game or pod racing or even this but more freedom and encounters and polished gameplay optimized for tje quest too and more force abilities.\n\nHelpful | 1", "daniellespeyerJul 10 at 1:56 AM\nVader immortal\n\nSo very cool it's as if your in a movie!

You walk around and do the things the story tells you to, but there's not much of a game there. The story looks like it could be going somewhere fun. Vader himself is an imposing, larger-than-life lord of the Sith. However, a lot of his presence depends on him being taller than you, and my Quest was inconsistent in detecting my height. In several scenes Vader was about 6\" shorter than me, making the mood more funny than dramatic.\n\nThe other part of Vader Immortal is the lightsaber dojo, which is a proper game with 40 arena levels slicing droids in half. It's a lot of fun; my only complaint is that you're entirely reactive, so you can have annoying pauses where you wait for your droid enemies to do something. I'm told the second and third chapters fix this.\n\nHelpful | 1", "the_watchmasterJun 4 at 1:48 PM\nLoved it\n\nFantastic, if brief, experience.

You dont get the full sense of scale until you stand next to Darth Vader himself, and you realize he is HUGE. The only problem I ever had was with the length. I actually played the story twice through because it felt too short. I only really wanted to get my moneys worth. To actually do that, I have played the dojo for as long as I could bear it. Overall, the story is maybe 30-45 minutes total, whereas the dojo (with dying 6 trillion times) is probably another 10 hours. This game is really more dojo and less story, which if you are a fan of swiping at things with a lightsaber might be your thing, but personally I prefer a more story driven game.

Very fun and is a great workout too! I was sweating pretty badly after 30 minutes or so. It takes some time to get used to the controls and the game, but after you do it's much more enjoyable. I barely survived the first 5 levels of the dojo with 1 bar of health left, but I got better and better with each level so even though it got harder, I got better at it. I'm still not fast enough to get all the stars at the end, but I'm getting through the levels with zero hits so I'm pretty happy. $10 is a bargain even if the game was just the dojo. It's way better than beat saber.\n\nEDIT: I wish there was a way to get rid of the second controller. It just gets in the way. I put the controller aside outside of the boundary but all that did was give me a floating glove right in the middle of the game.

I appreciated cinematic moments, like when tired fighters fly above you and lead your eyes towards the star destroyer looming above you. And nothing can prepare you for looking up at Vader, and how big he is.\n\nI liked Maya Rudolph's droid character. I can imagine some people finding her annoying and I wasn't a huge fan of how she talks to the other characters you meet, but when it's just you and her I enjoyed the dynamic.\n\nWatching gameplay videos, you can see the lightsaber you use looks jittery. I can confirm this is indeed the case in-game, it's as bad as it looks. That said, the controller vibrations and turning it on with the button make it feel like you're holding something real. The combat isn't very clear or much fun, but chopping wires to progress was satisfying.\n\nTeleporting makes for fairly comfortable movement. The blinking takes longer than I'd like though. And once you get to the climbing sections (of which there are more than I'd like) those are truly sickening. There's an option to turn them off in the settings, which is helpful because they're not a good time.\n\nThat's everything worth knowing. It's a Star Wars.

Oh and climbing ladders, thats weirdly cool.

The storyline is compelling and the graphics are really immersive. Great soundtrack to the game too. There's something rather intimidating about stormtroopers in the dark, up close when you're unarmed.\n\nThat said, there's no movement sensitivity adjustment, so you're stuck with teleporting or jerking around the map in a dizzying haste. There needs to be a way to adjust control sensitivity!\n\nLightsaber combat is also less satisfying. To block or parry you have to put your lighrsaber just so and hold still, then it staggers your opponent and you can counter strike. Its just not natural to sword fighting. And slashing through enemies just shakes them around (rather than slicing bits off) until they eventually shake apart. Honestly, if all you're looking for is the saber combat, get beat saber instead.\n\nAm I going to buy the remaining 3 episodes?

The movement and interactions are limited, however it helps control the pacing and does not take anything away from the experience.

The brooding scenery looks fantastic with a decent score to make it all that much more authentic.\n\nThe sabre fighting quickly devolves into the usual chaos of mediocre fight games, with the trainings parry and cut instructions being too basic and a bore in the robot training, or with a single opponent, yet impossible to keep up with when theres multiple opponents. That needs nuance with more time and gameplay mechanics in both the coding and scenario devoted to those duels. Its an everything coming at-ya at once solution that has you swinging wildly, knocking over furniture and falling on your butt. Of course practice might change that, but Im not hooked enough to repeat the whole narrative in order to try and retry to find more depth to the fights.\n\nI dont see it having very much replay value, once the 20 minute-or-so game is completed, but if youre a Star Wars fan (who isnt), then its narrative and cinematic scope is probably worth the investment.

So basically, you switch hands ..\n\nSpeaking of sabers, i would have expect some story before getting one but no its just laying in a room, and you pick it up.

If you are not doing it \"right\" the screen goes black and you have to move back to your spot. It feels more like a bunch of 360 videos stuck together than an interactive experience. I felt like being an observer. I think because of this I just did not get the feeling I was there. This feeling might also be due to the environment. I have a fear of heights and I typically have issues with getting close to edges in VR titles. For some reason I did not have this feeling at all with Vader Immortal, the environment was not convincing my brain I was up high. Maybe this is because of limitations on the Quest graphics, but still.\n\nThe lightsaber was also underwhelmig. I did not feel like it was a powerful item at all and when you wave it around fast it just becomes a white blur and looks silly.\n\nThe coolest part was the run in with the stormtroopers.\nOther than that is was meh.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ElvisCApr 4 at 8:47 AM\nAwesome\n\nIt was a total experience.

But it needs improvement\n\n( this is for all 3 games but I can't be bothered writing this three times so so spoilers!!!!) I got this free because, I recently purchased the quest at the end of January and the second I got it I started Vader Immoral. And I loved it the story was very impressive for an Oculus game but here are things it needs to improve on. First, It was short but very sweet for 3 games I thought it was going to be long and not as short as it was. Next, this just may be me but I'm not a fan on teleporting I prefer walking with the joy sticks and not being stuck to one place. Number 3 l, The first episode was the best one because (Vader has the a lot of screen time) the story was easy to understand but 2 was still good the monster scared the live out of me multiple times the third one got odd the weird race on mustafar ( I think that's how you spell it) made very little sense. Last, you could not die to say (or I'm just that good) and that upset me the Vader fight was short and not very entertaining. I know. Down puting this game but it was amazing the area was very impressive and the light saber duels are very good they don't glitch through each other or not register as a hit and the force is very well done.

Firstly, this game is great and you should buy it (especially if you get a 5 dollar voucher from oculus). Thats what happened to me and it was 5 bucks.\nThe story is great. Immersive, interesting, and fulfills a dream of wielding a lightsaber. The story is just too short though. Way too short. Maybe 30 minutes. Probably 10 if you have played it through previously and know where to go. It is just too short, plain and simple with very little exploration for re-playability . The ending is amazing and left me wanting more but Im not sure its worth the price if the next episodes are this short. The dojo is pretty fun and allows you to improve along with earning different lightsaber colors. It also has a tme trial element to it, if youre into that sort of thing. If this game didnt have the dojo, this review would be much different. I want to play more of the story but Im not sure if 10 dollars for another short piece is worth it and another 10 to compete it.\n\nThis is very cool to show friends and family but just sorta rubs the itch instead of scratching it.\n\nThe summary is:\n\nI enjoyed what I played, but i just cant overlook how short the game was and the lack of replay ability.

I can finally live out my fantasy of being a Jedi (even if Episode I doesn't have force powers), and seeing Darth Vader in VR invokes a level of fear and intimidation that I've never experienced while watching the movies. My only complaint with the game is the Lightsaber Dojo. The blaster enemies are too difficult to predict, and I can't figure out how to reliably deflect their attacks back at them.

I enjoyed playing through the story mode, maintaining engagement throughout the entire time. While I played, I hardly noticed any glaring issues with bugs, and thought the graphics were impressive considering this is being run by a mobile processor. A few weeks later, much of this opinion I still stand by today, though some things have changed.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics: One of the more visually impressive games on the quest, looks great\n- Comfort Options: I don't get motion sickness in VR, but if you do there are teleportation and smooth locomotion options available.\n- Few bugs interrupted the experience\n- Story was enjoyable, although rather short\n- Combat in wielding the lightsaber was smooth and enjoyable\n- Climbing felt tense, especially during the \"Ascent\" section\n- Lightsaber Dojo adds some replayability\n\nCons:\n- Graphics don't compare to PCVR games, but this is to be expected of course\n- Game is really short\n- Completely linear experience, so if you are looking for a more 'open' game, this won't be it\n- The physics of getting stuck in walls was really immersion breaking at times\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars, and consider it a must buy for the Oculus Quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "craft356Jun 21 at 9:12 AM\n\nGame is good, but story is really short like you need to buy another episode, and dojo si good but i dont like the fact that you cant move freely you need to be like only in the small red circle so i would like to have them do it better and last thing is that bots in dojo feel little bit weird like its taking them too long to attack i know its weird but when ur watching the droid for whole minute and hes doing the same thing its like really weird :D but okay, and Hope in the second game is force xd\n\nHelpful | 0", "ggorilla13Jun 9 at 6:04 PM\nAudio to low\n\nThe game is to short.

It has great graphics, it has really cool lightsabers, it has really good voice acting, and one of my favorite parts is the lightsaber dojo. In episode 3 you get the greatest dojo when you finish. The dojo is a place where you train with lightsabers that you can unlock by getting points.

I was also surprised when I loaded up Episode 2 and saw that we would be getting the force! I WAS SO EXCITED!

When the story is complete, you have the endless dojos which are great for burning time. It is really fun and challenging. Worth your purchase.

Roughly an hour of gameplay. I personally feel that this would have felt far better paying for the game in one instead of it being split into further chunks as it feels far more like a money grab this way. Id recommend it being about 4.99 per episode as it seems far more reasonable.\n\nHowever, the game that is actually there is astonishing. The graphics are unbelievable for a quest and has lots of activists to get involved in and enjoy. For the entire game i actually was that immersed i forgot i was in my home instead of a galaxy far far away! The quality is like watching a movie with an excellent story line. I did my experience stationary but would of been far more immersive in a bigger room. I did purchase the game solely to fight Vader which was not found in this particular episode which was disappointing and it is the sort of game you can only play once.\n\nOverall it was a fantastic game and definitely a must buy if you own a quart but is defiantly far far shorter than expected but then did exceed expectations in the quality which makes up for the length!\n\nHelpful | 0", "allfather666Mar 9 at 11:09 PM\nGreat but too short\n\nSince I am a Star Wars fan and was searching for a more story driven experience in VR this was the only solution.

It's way too short and of course ends right when it gets good. The game feels like it should be one big game and not be broken up into three episodes. That said if you think of it as one big game for 30 bucks it's a fair deal and being able to spend a third of that to see if it interest you isn't a bad deal.

I am a big Star Wars fan and this game has a good plot that does not contradict any of the rest of the Star Wars story, and even helps it a little. There are some cool scenes where you get to duel against robots with lghtsaber sticks and stuff. But the best part is the lightsaber training dojo. Literally you have a lightsaber and you get attacked by robots and training remotes with lazers, robots with lightsabers, remotes with buzz saws and remotes with force fields and you have to defeat them by reflecting their lazers at them, dueling with the robots, etc. and there are levels in the dojo that get harder and harder and there are like 200 of these so you will not finish this with all the levels geting 5 stars in less than a year unless you are a total addict or something.

This game is by no means bad, but could be better.\n\nHelpful | 0", "WalvisophetdrogeMar 19 at 11:17 AM\nBeautiful S.W. universe but short game\n\nit is so nice to be in the Star Wars universe, the graphics are really well done, but prepare yourself for a journey of only 25-40 min + some shoot and lightsaber practice\n\nHelpful | 0", "porkis3312Apr 27 at 8:22 PM\nFine but short\n\nI like everything except one thing its way to short I would have liked a longer game and being able to win and lose the battles more.\n\nHelpful | 0", "joncarroJun 13 at 1:05 PM\nA part of Star Wars\n\nThis game is awesome.

Vader Immortal takes Star Wars to the next level, it really feels like your in the Star Wars universe. The story is amazing and well made. One of my favorite parts is the Lightsaber Dojo.

The experience you get is extremely amazing. I got this game bundled with my oculus quest. The game ran smoothly, the graphics were really good and the gameplay experience really immersed me in. The only bug I experience was when I climbed the ladder to grab my partners hand to climb up. It will not let go and then my partner was dragging me around while glitching into the wall and floor. It then kept telling me to get back in the game since I was out of the boundary. The issue was fixed right after I reset the game and I was relieved that there are checkpoints and I did not have to start from the beginning! Other than that the game ran amazing! I played this episode from start to finish but I will recommend a small break or two if you are a brand new player like me.

Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! Youre monsters. Youre sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I dont know. BARRY Their days not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You cant just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONTD) Look at that. Thats more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime.

They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, its got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? Its a little bit of magic, aint it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. Thats amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...thats pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool.

They fly over a fountain. BUZZ Im picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Dont we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual. We see what appear to be yellow flowers on a green field. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 24. They go into a deep bank and dive. BUZZ Hold on, one of these flowers seems to be on the move.

We see Barry having trouble maneuvering the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running up. He has a killer look in his eyes. Hes going to hit the ultimate overhead smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe youre about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the jock. KEN What? No! He misses badly. The ball rockets into oblivion. Barry is still hanging on. ANGLE ON: Ken, berating himself. KEN (CONTD) Oh, you cannot be serious.

VANESSA Well, theres still a little left. I could heat it up. KEN Yeah, heat it up. Sure, whatever. Vanessa EXITS. Ken and Barry look at each other as Barry eats. BARRY So, I hear youre quite a tennis player. Im not much for the game myself. I find the ball a little grabby. KEN Thats where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isnt really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think I dont see what youre doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud out. KEN Thats just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table. BARRY Im going to go drain the old stinger. KEN Yeah, you do that. Barry EXITS to the bathroom, grabbing a small piece of a VARIETY MAGAZINE on the way. BARRY Oh, look at that. Ken slams the champagne down on the table. Ken closes his eyes and buries his face in his hands. He grabs a magazine on the way into the bathroom. SEQ. 2800 - BARRY FIGHTS KEN INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ken ENTERS, closes the door behind him. Hes not happy. Barry is washing his hands. He glances back at Ken. KEN You know, Ive just about had it with your little mind games.

Why is your life any more valuable than mine? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 81. KEN Its funny, I just cant seem to recall that! Ken WHACKS at Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT'D) I think something stinks in here. He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah?

He comes out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY Ken, look at me! Im wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. ANGLE ON: Ken turning the hand shower nozzle from GENTLE, to TURBO, to LETHAL. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 82. KEN Ive got issues! Ken fires the water at Barry, knocking him into the toilet. The items from the vanity (emory board, lipstick, eye curler, etc.) are on the toilet seat. Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY Youre bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while hes surfing. Some water splashes on Ken. BARRY Surfs up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing? KEN You know what? I dont even like honey! I dont eat it! VANESSA We need to talk! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 83. She pulls Ken out by his ear. Ken glares at Barry. CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS VANESSA Hes just a little bee.

Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame. KEN And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners, made by man! He EXITS again. The DOOR SLAMS behind him. VANESSA (to Barry) Im sorry about all that. Ken RE-ENTERS. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 84. KEN I know its got an aftertaste! I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. (puts his hands in his pockets) I couldnt overcome it. Oh well.

MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, dont worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they dont like about bees.

Adam explodes from the table and flies towards Montgomery. ADAM Im going to pin cushion this guy! Montgomery turns around and positions himself by the judges bench. He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, dont! Its what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! Im hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You cant treat them like equals. Theyre strip-ed savages! Stingings the only thing they know! Its their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I cant feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff. BAILIFF Take it easy. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 88. MONTGOMERY Oh, what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? The JURY recoils.

HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now heres Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didnt I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesnt matter. The important thing is youre alive. You could have died. ADAM Id be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONTD) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, theres a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I cant explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. Im sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, were just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I dont know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesnt sound so bad. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they dont check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONTD) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees dont smoke. BARRY Right. Bees dont smoke. Bees dont smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, thats it! Thats our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is?

JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, its interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we dont make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, havent these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this courts valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. Hes suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomerys motion. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you cant. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judges bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY Its a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldnt hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judges bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a high 5. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! Im okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we wont have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! Youll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barrys deer in headlights expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there?

DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - HONEY ROUNDUP EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, were going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95.

BARRY Well, thats our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if theres no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldnt it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH.

PILOT (pulling an earphone back, to the co-pilot) What did you say, Hal? CO-PILOT I didnt say anything. PILOT (he sees Barry) Ahhh! Bee! BARRY No, no! Dont freak out! Theres a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones) Ahhh! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 112. The pilot grabs a DUSTBUSTER vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilots head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! Im an attorney! CO-PILOT Whos an attorney? PILOT Dont move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilots nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button. The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold. Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN Vanessa studies her laptop, looking serious. SFX: PA CRACKLE. BARRY (V.O) (in captain voice) Good afternoon passengers, this is your captain speaking.

Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. Im a florist from New York. BUD Wheres the pilot? VANESSA Hes unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good.

Barrys family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. Thats why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117.

BARRY That flower! VANESSA Im aiming at the flower! The plane goes after a FAT GUY IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT. BARRY (V.O) Thats a fat guy in a flowered shirt! The other other flower! The big one.

ADAM Barry, it worked. Did you see the giant flower? BARRY What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius, man. Genius! ADAM Thank you. BARRY But were not done yet. Barry flies up to the wing of the plane, and addresses the bee crowd. BARRY (CONTD) Listen everyone. This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. Were the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If were going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains? BEES Were bees! KEYCHAIN BEE Keychain! BARRY Then follow me... Except Keychain. BUZZ Hold on Barry. Youve earned this. Buzz puts a pollen jock jacket and helmet with Barrys name on it on Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 126. BARRY Im a pollen jock! (looking at the jacket. The sleeves are a little long) And its a perfect fit. All Ive got to do are the sleeves. The Pollen Jocks toss Barry a gun. BARRY (CONTD) Oh yeah! ANGLE ON: Martin and Janet Benson.

Each episode is absurdly short and focuses way too much on showing you things and making you listen to people talk rather than actually letting you do anything, and the stuff you can do is mostly glorified traversal segments and pulling levers and dials on walls.\n\nMy biggest problem with VR titles, especially on Quest, is that they are all meant to be the exact same thing: Ooooh look motion controls in VR isnt it sooooooo exciting look how new and interesting this is oooooooh. Taking way too much time to try to make the player gawk at doing things with their hands instead of just letting them get immersed in an enjoy the game, and Vader Immortal is no exception. VR devs need to put time in to actually making games, not short gimmicky experiences, but actual games.\n\nHaving got it for free with my Quest, Vader Immortal was fun and I really enjoyed it, but I would never have actually paid for this on its own.\n\nHelpful | 5", "Knight_VectorFeb 17 at 5:03 PM\nA Fun But Short Experience\n\nIf youre a fan of Star Wars, youre going to love this game.

I like Star Wars but am not a hardcore fan but what makes me give VI the five stars is the quality of the graphics and the interaction with other characters. Nothing I have seen so far on the Quest has that feeling of actually being part of the narrative. Then there are the dojos where you can destroy countless drones and bot with your light sabre. I get bored fairly quickly but others really love climbing up the levels - and there are plenty of them.\nThe downside. As a game it's pretty limited, you can't fail as the narrative just carries you along. It comes in three fairly expensive and short episodes. But what the heck, this kind of VR immersive storytelling is new and expensive to make so I think it's worth it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DarkLord_UnicornJan 28 at 4:35 PM\nJedi Dojo\n\nI love this game for the Jedi Dojo mainly.

You are constantly finding new and enjoyable skills that the game allows you to get used to really well. The graphics are great. The combat is slick and the best it could be. The dojo is where its at though. There are loads and loads of stages to complete, each presenting you with a new challenge. From doing these stages well, you can unlock new lightsabers and tips along the way. The way using a lightsaber feels perfectly captures that epic essence you see in the movies and other Star Wars games. May I add, the episodes are extremely cheap as well for the incredible game that lies within. If you are new to Star Wars or a die hard fan, check this game out. It will get your blood pumping and makes you feel like a real Jedi (or sith).\n\nHelpful | 0", "DemonicAngel026Jan 20 at 7:58 PM\nGreat game\n\nI played this game and it is really great, the only thing I would change is that they enable smooth turning and not have the user locked to an 8 pt circle but other than that I think its really good and has great options like sitting option and 180degree play mode etc. really enjoy led playing this game. Also, it would be cool to dual wield double bladed light sabers and mix there colors and versions while in Vaders dojo so u can use like a purple with red and stuff.

If you're expecting a game or even a decent experience you should look elsewhere.\n\nSure, the theme is authentic Star Wars. However as a game this is lackluster and rather boring. World interaction is very limited, there's really nothing in terms of puzzle. The most interesting thing you do is climb with an interaction mode used more eloquently in the free Mission ISS app. Dialogue is trite and out of place (why is that bot talking so loud when Vader is *right there*). Characters, such as there is, are flat stereotypes that add no spark to the experience.\n\nNow the combat. The combat is a bit meh. Yes, you hold an authentic looking lightsabre. Congrats. Deflecting blaster shots is relatively satisfying in the dojo, but only appears in the story once as I recall. Actual melee combat is painfully crippled by requiring the player to essentially stand in place. This is ridiculous and a huge missed opportunity. Why can't I circle these two bots to properly line them up? Have the developers never watched the movies or have they only seen the duel between Vader and Obi-Wan in Episode 3?\n\nI don't expect much at this price point, and so the shortness doesn't count against this, but this offering not encouraged me to buy the other episodes.\n\nHelpful | 0", "beyonderaMar 12 at 1:52 PM\nShort experience type of game\n\nThe game is pretty short - 1-2hours.

The only thing I would change is the frames per second. If you swing your saber too fast it will skip over and if you swing on the ground you can see the marks as a row of spread out dots.

For one, its too short!!!!!! I was done in around an hour to an hour and a half and I was left wanting more. I know there are two other games but I wish there was a little more action in the first game. The other problem is a little more annoying but still doesnt ruin the game. I had issues where after climbing, the game would glitch and force me to restart it to continue playing. Its really only in one or two parts of the game though so its fine I guess.

Not a Star Wars super fan but it was an engaging story and the visuals were really neat - really felt like I was on a ship and on another world. Deducting a Star because it could be more action packed and also I find it odd that a lot of the textures arent solid. Like in the ship there are a ton of buttons. Even if they wont do anything would be nice if they were solid and at least pressed when clicked. Even first steps and first contact demo games do that. Instead your hand kind of goes through them partly which takes a bit away from the immersion.

Literally. Give the artists a raise! It felt like a movie but also a game just wow.\n\nMy only criticism is that from the start of playing the game up until the end credits, it took me less than 30 minutes to complete. Thats far too short of a game in my opinion. Same goes for chapters 2 and 3. I was drawn in the depths of the story but before I knew it the end credits had started to roll. Quite a big let down if Im honest. At least one of the episodes is worth buying for the experience.\nAnother point to make is that theres not that much freedom of movement and choice in the game play. The instructions are quite simple: press this, walk here, push that button id love it more if we were given an objective for example find this item and then left to our own devices to fully explore without interruption while still following the story.\nFor that the gameplay should last more than 30 minutes clearly. Hundreds of ours at least. And Id happily pay a price of 35-40 as such games on the PS4 and Xbox cost, for the same amount of gameplay time. That way I feel the game would have more replay value. Because youre back to follow a story and get lost in the experience all over again. Instead of being restricted.

I loaded up the first episode and jumped right into the story. When I played the first episode, I found myself bored with the narrative and only got to use my lightsaber (you find it 2/3 of the way throughout the episode) during 2 encounters excluding the lightsaber tutorial. I thought yo myself \"it's only the first episode, it'll get better.\" Only to find that the second episode was just as boring with little interaction. I thought \"ok I'm about to do the last episode, this has got to be the grand finale and make everything right\" but of course this was not the case. While there was more interaction (I'm grateful they improved on that) I found I couldn't die, which made me feel like a super being that could soak up all the blaster fire and couldn't even be taken down by vader's swings. The story as a whole was boring, had no challenge, and felt like it was forcing you to like the characters it was presenting. Because it was a linear playthrough with no secrets or unlockables, there is absolutely no replayability and there is no character development. The only thing I had fun with were the dojos. I just hope to see the developers see this review and improve the next game because this has a lot of potential and I'd love to see it grow.\n\nHelpful | 13", "CrossfitMinecraftGodFeb 9 at 2:09 PM\nAmazing\n\nThis is exactly what I want in a Star Wars vr game\n\nHelpful | 0", "1337_Feb 17 at 7:34 AM\nOutstanding intro to VR\n\nLove this.\n\nHelpful | 0", "peterluffMar 29 at 12:43 AM\nTotally immersive A+\n\nMy first VR game experience and I was totally blown away by how immersive the experience was.

The dojo is a fun aspect to the game as well. The combat is entertaining enough to let you get lost in the game for hours, and the desire to unlock some of your favorite characters lightsabers can be enough to drive you to play longer. The biggest issue with the dojo is the point system though. You start out with three points, but lose them if youre hit or a certain time stamp is passed.

However I feel that the first game was left in the dust by the other two in terms of attention to detail. Now Im not going to spoil it for those who havent played the games yet, but I feel that a lot of the mechanics are improved in the next two games, but not in the first. Im being extremely picky, but I feel its worth noting things like the belt and how there are actual slots you can put your tools and saber in, but only in the next two games. In the first game, theres nothing to indicate that you could put your stuff at your waist, you just accidentally let go of an item and you realize its on your hip. Another thing is the lack of directions on how to use things.

The graphics are great, audio makes it nice and immersive and the scale of the environments make it feel fun to actually walk around and do things since I was playing in a really large room. The climbing glitches were annoying and I had to reset the game a couple times but the exhilaration of learning to use the force was a blast. My problem is, in episode three I played the training dojo before the actuall mission and got really excited about the possibility of throwing my lightsaber like a boomerang while simultaneously using the force to grab another guy and pull him into the flight path and do this epic Sith style attack as well as the big pulse you can do once your anger meter is charged up. Went into the mission hanging on the edge of my seat waiting for a chance to do those moves in game. Unfortunately, I never got the chance and the whole time I have this old lightsaber that short circuits after a couple strikes. Couldn't even throw it. No rage strikes, no nothing. Barely get a chance to use the force to take the gun from a stormtrooper. The game was good as is, but they give you so much more while standing in one spot at the training dojo I wish they would have included that stuff in game. Would have been awesome. They leave it hanging as if there will be more episodes. That all just left me with a mixed feeling at the end.

The story mode where you follow the robot and see Vader, that is not the actual game. That's just the background lore if anything else.\n\nThe REAL game you're buying here is lightsaber dojo. There are so many levels to go through, and each level gets progressively more challenging, requiring greater skill and awareness to complete. You can move to the next level without getting 3 marks, but it's best to completely master each level before moving to the next.\n\nAs you gain mastery, there will be more interesting opponents to fight and you will unlock additional kyber crystals to change the color of your lightsaber. You will need to adjust your form based on which opponent you are facing if you wish to survive without being hit, which is required to master the level.\n\nI'm currently on level 9, this game more than anything else gives me the feeling of training to be a jedi master. At higher levels you need to listen very carefully in order to react to the incoming attacks in time, and some of these instances really give the illusion of learning to feel an attack coming via the Force.\n\nSo again, play through the story, because it is very cool and Darth Vader is quite intimidating in person. But don't think for a second that is where the game stops. That is only the beginning.\n\nMy only complaint is there are times where the blade can \"bend\" a little bit in certain instances (not always, just every once in a while) which doesn't really feel like a lightsaber should move that way. It's not incredibly noticeable, but it certainly loses to the sabers in beat saber in terms of sturdiness. That being said, I really love the design of the handle and the vaporous glow of the blades are quite pretty.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Coltslinger04Dec 25 at 10:29 AM\nBest vr experience\n\nIt is good for what it is I thought it would be destroying practice droids over and over again but I was really surprised I raised my hands when the storm troopers blasted the door down and shot the nice robot\n\nHelpful | 0", "mgbro24Feb 3 at 4:34 PM\nGreat story\n\nGood game\n\nHelpful | 0", "logan4019Jan 23 at 6:59 PM\n\nOnly complaint was that there wasnt more in the first episode\n\nHelpful | 0", "desireestorm666Jan 23 at 1:46 PM\nI WAS THE FORCE\n\nI WAS AMAZED AND SCARED AT THE SAME TIME...JOIN ME...NO REGRETS\n\nHelpful | 0", "campton_nerdFeb 9 at 8:13 AM\nIncredibly fun\n\nThe only problem its the extreme sensitivity of the guardian.\n\nHelpful | 0", "alilarsJan 4 at 8:32 PM\nImmersive!\n\nI didnt know darth Vader was that tall until I played this awesome game!

You are only permitted to do the predetermined next step. If the game played differently each time, or defiance of Darth lead to your death and you had to start over, that would be great.

There is no branching storylines or play choice (even minimal) it's just a linear story that you immerse yourself in. While that may sound bad, I assure you IT IS NOT BAD. They story is wonderful, I had a big stupid grin on my face the entire time and it only let's better Episode by Episode. If you like the way the light saber feels, take your newly acquired skills to the extremely replayable Light Saber Dojo (2 if you buy Episode 2) and experience what makes this a game and a movie.

And my god... the feeling of the lightsaber for the first time or seeing how large Vader is and the internal fear that brings are two of the reasons only why this wait was justified.\n\nIf you enjoy enjoying things and fun then just play this.

Some of the riddles could be a bit more challenging and less obvious. Maybe different levels of difficulty would help to please those who just want to walk through the interactive movie, but also those who would like to have a little more game-feeling.\n\nWhich means, there is still some room for future improvements and I hope Oculus will continue to cooperate with Lucasfilm to ensure more Star Wars games after episode 3.

Was it short? Well ya, but I am not going to complain about that because I read the reviews before I bought it and knew that it wasn't going to be very long. Vader Imortal is an interactive vr story experience, and what an experience it is. There is an area where you are flying in a skiff over a chasm towards the priestesses castle under Vader's fortress. This was nothing short of stunning. I can see why it was a huge 3.6gb download for only a 45 minute story. The scale, scope, visuals, and wonder of that area was amazing! Also when I was walking on the outside ledge high on the wall of Vaders fortress, I must of spent 10 minutes staring at the awsome fire and lava landscape way down below while Ty fighters were flying around doing their patrols. The sense of scale and depth here was also incredible. Something only possible in vr. All this and a bunch of interactive activities you have to perform that will get you very imersed in this world. For those who love the Star Wars universe and would love to experience it, you should like it alot. If that, and the additional light saber fighting dojo which is hours of fun in itself is worth $10.00 to you, then buy it. If not, then don't.\n\nHelpful | 1", "NeillwolfDec 25 at 1:59 PM\nHoly Cow\n\nWhen I turned on my lightsaber it gave me goosebumps. So freaking realistic!!!!!!

The game has great controls and wielding the lightsaber is smooth and great. I have yet to try Lightsaber dojo, but it personally sounds like a fun arcade experience. However, the campaign mode leaves a lot to be desired.\nThe story isn't anything new compared to your average Star Wars story. You begin as a nobody and eventually become a rookie jedi. However, the story is very short. Everything goes by way too quickly and when the episode is over, you're left feeling like it ended way too soon and there should've been more. Might be a creative choice in order to push customers to buy the other episodes, but I can say this now: each epsiode is very fast and the whole trilogy can be beaten within hours. The story is decent, but the experience is slightly ruined during scripted cutscenes where the game asks you to stay still, or when you step somewhere the game doesn't want you to be. The game demands that you stay where it wants you to be, and if you go outside the accepted area, everything goes black and the game asks you to return to the proper area. It could take you away from the experience and sometimes ruin it completely.\nTo conclude Vader Immortal is a fun game, however the game demands you to stay still during specific times and to not walk into certain areas, and if you do walk off you're taken out of the game, ruining the experience. Even then, the campaign goes by so fast, it leaves a lot to be desired, even after playing the whole trilogy of games.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ResonantFluxDec 25 at 11:43 AM\nI love it!\n\nI'm not exactly a veteran at vr games, but this game was great!

The time frame I mention is simply for campaign and doesnt include the Dojo which is a ton of fun as well.\nGame doesnt feel quiet complete with how quickly it can be completed and how quickly it leaves you hanging for the next installment, but once again that is kept in perspective with the price and these VR games so far seem to be much shorter, but less expensive than the gaming formats I am used to playing. Its $10 (as of this review) and you get to see Vader face to face, dont overthink it too much if a Star Wars fan. 2nd installment is already for sale, they are changing meta by releasing chunks at a time quickly for smaller price vs the full game which everyone would have to wait on.\n\nHelpful | 6", "Seboy2006Nov 16 at 2:32 PM\nFantastic Game.\n\nNot only have I dreamed of being a Jedi wielding a lightsaber, I also dreamed of flying through the galaxy with a droid.

This game literally made my child cry. The limitation on movement meant that at some point he had those giant arrows telling him to get back to center. He moved around the entire play space (with me watching the stream) and he was not able to get back into \"position\". What I used to consider a limitation is now officially sloppy development and quite possibly not well tested on shorter humans. I have found a handful of games where height is a serious issue. I'm not sure why Vader barfed on my son, but he's given up - and rightfully so.\n\nThis is pretty good demo. It's super short, and it really has no business calling itself 6DOF. Most of the scenes you can't arbitrarily walk around in. Instead it's more of a rail game where you can only stand in specific spots. When fighting with my light saber I'm constantly being broken out of the illusion by the screen turning into a GIANT warning that says I need to return the correct location and orientation. I should have just played this game sitting down. Besides, trying to dodge lightsabers hitting you is pointless - they don't do any damage. Might as well just let them hit you.\n\nIt's a beautiful walk through. But too short to be worth paying for and too fixed to be a compelling game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Brock345678Dec 31 at 3:48 PM\nAwesome\n\nYou feel immersed and when you climb though its very scary.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Regi.rileyDec 5 at 12:29 PM\nAmazing\n\nI cant begin to describe this experience.

I enjoyed this game. The world built is very impressive. I think it is a very good introduction to learning how to use the Oculus Quest. The moment Darth Vader walks up to you, is a bit awe-striking for a moment. The game play is basic. The DoJo is fun and challenging. The game play is restrictive you're basically guided a long a path. I was expecting a little bit more free movement to investigate. You can look around a little, but there isn't much to see or do, looking over edges below. There might be easter eggs I haven't found yet, but I kind of doubt it.\nI would really like the ability to get mouthy and a bit snarky with Vader, but you can't. Essentially, you walk around as a mute. NPCs talk to you and act as if you respond, but you can't and character doesn't. As a casual gamer even I want more and deeper game play out of this. Still a good game but hopefully more involved games will be forth coming.\nI recommend the game as it still enjoyable.\n\nHelpful | 1", "CinnbleNov 15 at 10:35 PM\nABSOLUTELY AWESOME\n\nI tried this thinking it wouldn't be that interesting to me, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG!!!!

It's less a game and more an interactive movie where you play a key actor. I'd liken the experience to going to a really great haunted house or a theme park ride. There are some combat and puzzle elements but it's very linear and there no real stakes to missing a block and the puzzles don't get more complicated than simple switch throwing and knob turning. That said the experience is well voiced, well paced, and the sound track and sound effects are amazing. There are no real branching paths to the experience so replay value will be low for most. It does feature an arcade style lightsaber dojo that's far more of a game and will add some replay value/challenge.

All though the game is short this is a glimpse of potential of what the future of VR has in store for us. Interactive stories that we can experience is the future.\n\nI would love to see the whole Star Wars saga made like this, where we could enter the universe and experience each episode in VR. An interesting concept for this would be if the user followed the story of the movie with a script reader, prompting the user to read out the dialogue, making the user Interact with iconic characters and following the movies story. It would only progress if the user reads out the correct text. Imagine living out the Star Wars saga in VR experiencing first hand the Luke vs Vader seen from empire strikes back with your own diologue, that would be really something.\n\nHell imagine Knights of the old Republic remade in VR like this.

Yes you can walk through the story and follow directions but I took my time (many different scenes), checked out the incredible graphics, messed around where I could...the falling experiences were incredible and immersed! Then I went back in to check out the light saber Dojo again and played against the droids!!\n\nI am an original Star Wars fan...yes...that old....saw the original 11 times when I was 11...do the math...I'm Not a long time gamer but I am sold on VR!!! Do you remember the one white line static star wars arcade game? I doubt it... Seriously pathetic graphically but I played it constantly...VR is like going to Garden of the Hesperides and the closet I'll ever get to anything like the real thing!! I have a light Saber and get to fight against Storm Troopers!!! My adrenaline is rushing like a tidal wave!....ok....maybe not that much but I love the VR star wars Vader interaction...a Kid all over again!!!! Worth every penny...oh ya...pennies don't exist...worth all the dollars!!!

Your dojo rewards dont even carry into the story, and you dont do much more than stand and wait for the enemies to attack every ~30 seconds. When you can beat each one in ~10 seconds, it leaves a lot of time to admire the models and your saber, but also to get bored of it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "lolman65645Dec 26 at 11:10 AM\n\nGood story but quite short\n\nHelpful | 0", "ZJ1018Dec 26 at 5:20 PM\nGreat game\n\nJust wish it was longer :(\n\nHelpful | 0", "SlateHeartDec 7 at 2:26 PM\nAmazing\n\nLoved what I have played thus far!\n\nHelpful | 0", "EVEREST9Nov 29 at 9:13 AM\nOh man!\n\nThis experience was amazing.

It's quite pretty, but only marginally interactive. Mostly you watch the story unfold around you, you get to press a few buttons here and there and two short and easy combat sequences.\nThe dojo may offer some extra gameplay, but it's pretty basic and can feel like it has too much of a luck factor in it to get the maximum score on some rounds. I played that for 30 minutes and although waving a lightsaber around is cool... I think there are better experiences available to be coming back to.\nAll in all, I'm glad I got this for free with my quest. If I'd paid for this I think I would ask for a refund (you're easily within the time window). Only recommended if you don't mind paying 10 bucks for an hour of playtime.\n\nHelpful | 0", "digitaldoccNov 22 at 4:28 PM\nAwesome!\n\nSpecial thanks to the devs for bringing the fans a great interactive story to experience.

Does not matter really, two-dimensional YouTube videos won't convey what this game is like in the Oculus Quest virtual reality environment, a VR platform that puts you in the movie, in all the action, and where YOU are the star.\n\nAnyway, it goes without saying (but I nonetheless will) the graphics in this game are superior, player interaction intense, and the storyline is fasten-your-seat-belt cool/exciting. And there's even some aspects of the game that will give you a good workout.\n\nAs for me personally, I can't wait for the sequel or new episode to debut. I need that yesterday. For now I will play this game 1018 times.\n\nOver and out.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Dr.PickleCheeseNov 26 at 6:34 PM\nShort story but dojo is fun\n\nI love messing around in the dojo and trying to unlock everything.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DeAnte513Nov 30 at 5:56 PM\nNice\n\nI like this game.

Its too short but and for episode 3 I recommend someone make teleport optional as I absolutely hate that. I found the option on episode 2 after playing both campaigns. The 2nd campaign is trash. It was super boring and expositional but the lightsaber dojo in both alone is worth the money. They're a lot of fun. The second episode in particular is the most fun I've had in VR. Frankly you can skip the story and just play the dojo. The story is just a glorified cutscene and if you've played any amount of VR its nothing you havent seen before.\n\nHelpful | 0", "KujikenOct 7 at 8:17 PM\nShort but sweet!\n\nAs a Star Wars fan, it's a dream come true to wield a light saber and exist in the same Galaxy as the force! The cinematic presentation is excellent, although you're sort of held captive while the events play out (understandably, given the medium and potential to derail things). The lightsaber dojo alone is worth the price of admission, as battling Droids in endless waves is great fun, although there are a few problems sometimes with the game telling you to move back into the designated play space despite you not having moved out of it, but it's not a game breaking problem, merely an annoyance.

Fortunately, the controls are pretty intuitive and you get the hang of them as you go. Events move at a pretty brisk pace as you are thrown into one difficult situation after another like in the Star Wars movies. I was apprehensive about buying and playing this game and rightly so. Just the thought of being in the same environment as Darth Vader is enough to instill extreme fear but it's nothing compared to when you're actually near him in the game! The game is visually breathtaking and it's like being in one of the Star Wars movies, speaking of which, you get to wield a lightsaber! How much cooler can it get than that? Set up your playspace with plenty of room for swinging a lightsaber! How could you possibly play this game sitting down? In my opinion, this game is pretty much a must for Star Wars fans.

The first time I played I was in a very large play area and briefly forgot that I needed to move using the controls. I simply walked around the ship, and it was amazing.\n\nOnce you get into the game and start traversing the world, you'll be teleporting or sliding, which is, unfortunately, unavoidable. The experience still remains compelling though. For people who have never experienced VR but love Star Wars, this is the experience to show them (with motion set to teleport. I'm not prone to motion sickness but sliding takes a little getting used to before it stops being nausea inducing.)\n\nBe advised, it's short and linear. It's priced reasonably for what you get though. Think of it as a VR comic with a bonus lightsaber game attached.\n\nThe problems:\n\nLightaber tracking is, unfortunately, pretty bad. A lot of what should be hits don't seem to connect for some reason and there's a frustrating and noticeable latency to it. Considering that this is a Star Wars game in which you wield a lightsaber as your only weapon, this really ought to be at least as responsive and accurate as Beat Saber since it is the majority of game play.\n\nThe dojo, in which you wield the lightsaber and which is the primary chunk of content, other than the story, restricts you to an incredibly small area of movement. This feels crippling when facing multiple enemies since you will naturally want to move to evade some attacks while deflecting others and you simply can't for no obvious good reason. Particularly because battles in the Star Wars universe tend to feature a lot of motion (think about Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon versus Maul, the hide and seek battle between Luke and Vader through the guts of Cloud City, or the battle traversing the Emporer's throne room.)\n\nThe game is great and I eagerly await the next installment. In the meantime, they probably can't change the motion limitations for the Dojo in this version because it would require very different tuning, but I desperately hope they can improve the saber tracking and collision to the point it is comparable with Beat Saber and other blade swinging titles. Star Wars deserves it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Landman99Sep 20, 2019 at 4:14 PM\nAwesome but more to be desired\n\nI played this and wow, its insane.

Yeah, chapter one is short. An introductory chapter is supposed to introduce you to the story, the characters, and the mechanics the rest of the game will have, which this does beautifully.\n\nAnd to the people who say it's not 'interactive enough'. You're being ridiculous. How many games do you play where your choices ever truly affect the ending? (I'll give you a hint, none.) The writers are telling a story and they're not about to let some random player derail it. Enjoy their story or write your own.\n\nSome people say it was too easy. Well yeah, the beginning of a game is always easier than the rest. You're supposed to be learning. If the fighting was easy for you, great! I'm sure it won't be in the future.\n\nThis chapter is amazingly fun to play through. The characters are fun, (dare I say life size without double checking my facts), and the story is engaging. Anyone who's familiar with the Star Wars universe at all will be able to understand and enjoy the story.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are easy enough to grasp that my father, who has previously never played VR nor enjoyed video games at all, was able to jump in and go.\n\nAlmost as soon as the game began, he was in awe. He was constantly looking around and trying to point out everything he could see. He loved it, and kept commenting on how real it felt. So real, that when (SPOILER ALERT: Darth Vader shows up) Vader first showed up, he panicked and ripped the headset off. The next day, he kept talking about how amazing the game play was, how he wants to finish it, and how my brother needs to play it as well to 'see how real it is'. He's even showing it to his siblings and coworkers. So, clearly, fun for all ages.\n\nI highly recommend this game and all chapters that are coming (hopefully!) soon.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Mikepro72Aug 26, 2019 at 2:46 PM\nAWESOME !!!\n\nAmazing game and experience!

I loved everything about the story obviously starts off simple yet fun and get even better as it gets closer to the end. Even the little things in this game made it feel great such as pressing buttons pulling things and just simple things made this game great. The lightsaber addition was great and if your an adult will probably make you feel like a kid again.

You can make punching gestures at Vader and he doesn't react in any way, which ruins the immersion a bit - nothing you do has any effect. An equivalent of just pressing \"continue\" every once in a while. But ok - think of it more like a movie.\n\nThe environments are beautiful, and I'm sure if I had a larger space (like 5x5 meters large at least), it would be even better than having to constantly adjust something or teleport.\n\nThe biggest problem though is that the experience (not a game) is just plain boring. I gave it 3 attempts, but every time I find myself getting bored and wanting to do something else after a few minutes.

I was immersed the whole time and it felt truly real. The sense of scale was also phenomenal. When Vader first walked up to me, I had to back away because he was so tall and big and scary. This felt really cool.\n\nDespite all of these positives, there were some setbacks, specifically the length. I was excited to keep going and then it just stopped. I looked to see if I was missing something but I wasnt. Many people told me that this game could take as long as you wanted to, or you could zoom through it in about 35 minutes. I tried to take my time but it still took only 45 minutes.\n\nMy next complaint is that I wasnt able to look around in my ship long enough, and the ship felt too small. Ive always wanted to be aboard a Star Wars ship and was slightly dissatisfied with this.\n\nAnother complaint is that it had some annoying glitches. One time, my droid asked me to grab onto their hand and then they never let go of my hand. They kept telling me, do you think you can open that door over there? And I found myself yelling at the droid, no cause you wont let go of me! I had to restart the game to get through this.\n\nMy last complaint is that the dojo was underwhelming. I would have liked to be able to customize what I would be fighting or just be able to select the dojo level instead of it getting continuously harder, until it was too hard that it made it not fun. I would have also like to see an option if you wanted to do real lightsaber battles with enemys, and the enemys would be unpredictable, making it engaging.\n\nOverall, I think the game was great but short lived, and I think the $9.99 price tag was too much.

General \"playability\" of light sabers, climbing ladders, hacking doors and elevators etc. all worked pretty well. I had only 1 or 2 very short glitches while playing.\nI'm not a big star wars fan. I fell out of love with the Star Wars world when I got to see the Death Star blown up like, I don't know, practically at the end of every movie. It's a genre that was cool in the 70's and 80's and is a total flop in the 2000's. However, this was a cool game on it's on. I didn't quite follow the story, but I didn't need to. The gameplay was good enough on it's own. I with there was a short tutorial before starting, I had a hard time figuring out how to move at first, but wasn't a big deal.\nAll in all, this was worth the $10.

So if you swing fast at something you can miss it entirely, especially the small ball droids. If you swing too fast you just dont hit them at all. You have to slowly swing so that it registers your saber is touching them. You can see this by swinging at the ground. Swinging slowly you get a unbroken line of black burn marks. Swing fast and you get one or two dots. So it isnt interpolating the position of the blade between tracked points.\nThis isnt the only quest game using swords and the other games dont have this problem. there is no reason this should be an issue they need to change it. If they do that it will be perfect. if they dont then i can see myself quickly getting frustrated as at a certain level in the dojo its already causing me to have to replayed rounds.\nAlso, if the future games have story parts using this saber mechanic and its still broken then I probably wouldnt buy it.\n\nHelpful | 12", "SleepyeyezzSep 28, 2019 at 12:35 AM\n\nIt's a good game..\n\nHelpful | 0", "Soapy-Sep 14, 2019 at 8:33 AM\nVery fun but very short\n\nFor ten dollars it is pretty good but it is very short and lightsaber battles are weird\n\nHelpful | 0", "AshLeifSep 4, 2019 at 7:10 PM\nAn experience that is hard to remember\n\nThe first time you stand next to Vader is awesome.

But nobody is even working on a space sim for quest. Yup ... because nobody has a darn clue about what the market wants. The players like myself are nostalgic about the old titles of the 90's.

Briefly manipulating simple contraptions in VR is amusing yet far from engaging. The same goes for climbing. The supposed highlight of lightsaber combat is disappointingly shallow and demands the same viable precision as wiimote-waggling or eight-directional Skyward Sword blocking. This iteration on nerdoms long-sought-after Jedi simulator comes closer than ever before, but only due to the nature of VR wherein Vader Immortal still fails to deliver on the potential the medium holds. Fulfilling VR melee combat should reflect how it feels to hold two very lightweight controllers and depict targets that clearly respond to dynamic velocities/angles all the while using mechanics to enforce patience, accuracy, and full swings.\nStill, the game's sub-hour playtime might make it a nerdy, low-stakes introduction to VR.

One of those VR games where the online web video of it does not do it justice until you put the headset on and play then go ..WOW!\n\nI understand the <5 feedback on it, but this is one of those purchases that deliver and you cannot avoid being pulled into the thrill of it and the inevitable \"grin\" many mention that they leave with (I did). The fact it is SW and Vader obviously plays a large role but I would rather play an amazingly graphical immersive game that is less than an hour than a low repetitive polygon with cartoon graphics.\n\nI think this is a win and excited as to where VR games go in general if this quality is the benchmark. If they decided to make 10 of the next episodes I would buy all at once if necessary and delete all other games as the thrill and return on this type of experience is awesome.

Basically, longer arcade-style vs. shorter gaming experiences is where we are at. Spec limiting as the driver for the length I have to assume.

You do actually see Darth Vader in this and in great fashion. He is a bit intimidating where you feel you are really atandingnin front of Darth Vader. The light saber battle takes place in a forum where you are fighting with, not against Vader. Unfortunately, the game ends there.

My one complaint is the in game boundary system. If you step outside of the area it wants you to be in it stops all visual with a wall grid and tells you to step back in the world. It would have been a lot better if they left the boundaries up to the Oculus guardian system. Trying to lean forward to fight would make that screen go up so you can no longer see the guys you are fighting. I get that this isn't s room scale game but like I said even leaning would cause it to happen.

It reminded me of being in the holodeck on a Star Trek episode because it is so immersive that for an hour or so, you will genuinely forget about the real world. The ability to take something out of Darth Vaders hand is chilling. And to have characters come right up to you and look you in the eye is crazy!

The world will captivate you. It's really amazing. The climbing parts and puzzles make it really fun to play. Holding the lightsaber feels extremely powerful. They did a great job with the controls. Standing next to Vader for the first time without a weapon is very intimidating. You can explore a little bit, but for the most part you have to stay on track and follow your droid. The lightsaber battles in story mode are too easy though, BUT the dojo makes up for it. The amount of game play you get in story mode is roughly 40 minutes and feels short, but the dojo will last for hours and you can unlock different items.

Yeah, its only about 45 minutes to an hour of story/experience, but its Star Wars, its well done, and while the the LightSaber Dojo starts a bit slow, it gets really fun once you progress through the first 6-7 levels which add a lot more time to the game. Comparing this to 'PC titles that get 100's of hours of gameplay' is rediculous, you are talking different markets, with different customer base, etc. If you want good VR content now and in the near future, get used to paying a bit more for it until the VR userbase is hundreds of millions like PC.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Andy1256Jul 1, 2019 at 11:44 AM\nIncredible!\n\nI havent played through the whole game yet but I played for about an hour and it was the experience of a life time.

However, for as much fun as we are having the dojo can get a bit repetitive, and I would love to see more free movement lightsaber action. Additionally I was a bit disappointed with the lack of interaction in the story mode. The advertisement said that you would be able to interact with most everything in your environment and gave specific examples which I noticed in the game, such as the helmet and levers, but I found myself wanting to pick up or interact with things that my hands phased right through such as the cards and buttons on the ship. Some of the buttons aboard the ship seemed pushable at first but alas, were not interact-able. Also many colorful objects in the story areas seemed like they were meant to be interacted with but werent! I even tried to use the saber to cut into a box, to no avail.

Walking around the Windfall I enjoyed the nice feel of grabbing items and I felt more presence with some of the environment as compared to other games. However, I also found my first major gripe with the game, where doing as much as tilting your head can lead to a message telling you to return to the game world. Other games seem to have found better ways to execute this, instead this message breaks my immersion and disorients me, and it doesn't even pause the game so you can miss some events if you can't find your way back to the small spot the game wants you in. During gameplay I also encountered stuttering accompanied by audio glitches, it wasn't too uncommon but it became uncomfortable when it occurred.\n\nFor the mechanics of the game, I like the use & feel of the lightsaber, but some things like slicing objects with the saber and slicing terminals with the hydro spanner feel gimmicky, more like an unneeded cinematic segment rather than a practical mechanic which seems like part of the game world.\n\nLastly, I have some things to say about the story of the game. Spoilers ahead.\n\nOh gosh. Don't know if I'm just another fanboy having a freak out but ever since Disney blasted the EU and started making the \"A Star Wars Story\" series and other spin-offs like that it feels like they want to make new lore to fill in the gaps left but instead it feels like an amateur fairy tale. I'm still not convinced that some lady stricken with grief used the Bright Star or whatever to revive her husband and that's why the planet is blasted apart.

Maybe dojo isn't for everyone, but as a starwars fan I have wanted to train with a lightsaber since I could say \"jedi.\"\n\nThere is a lot of variation in the robots you face in dojo. It starts out easy but by the end it gets intense and something is attacking you at all times in 360 degrees. The final level of dojo (40) is intense. You have to survive a 5 minute straight onslaught and if you get hit twice youre dead.\n\nThe unlockables are fun and gave me reason to replay some earlier levels and attempt to get \"3 stars.\" My favorite unlock so far is the \"obiwan lightsaber,\" but you can unlock colors too (even yellow which is unusual). You have to get 110/120 available stars to unlock all the listed rewards. I am currently at 111/120 and sadly with no reward for 120/120 im not feeling motivated to continue, as getting 3rd stars can be quite difficult on some levels.\n\nI recommend tweaking the settings to your liking before doing the story. I had teleport locomotion and didn't like it at all. Didn't figure out how to change it until after.

As a lifelong Star Wars fan, this VR experience allowed me to inhabit the world of Star Wars in a way I never dreamed possible. The writing and voice acting are top notch, and I cannot wait to see where the next two chapters will take me. I purchased the Quest largely for this game.

Despite my hesitancy to endorse something locked into the Oculus ecosystem, I appreciate the significant investment it surely took from both Oculus and ILM to bring this to life. For me, it was the perfect blend of story and gameplay and really demonstrates how magical and immersive VR can be. If there is any criticism to be found it's that the story experience is too short (about 45 minutes). It's such a great experience that I was legitimately sad when it ended and I can't wait for the next chapters to be released. The good news, however, is that there is a really solid training/dojo mode that you can access which let's you use your lightsaber against waves of enemies.

A good thing about Vader Immortal is that you really don't have to watch any of the Star Wars movies to understand what is happening in the game. The developers did really great in setting up the story in the beginning of Episode 1 and I quickly understood what the purpose of the Episode was about. I am so amazed by the amount of detail and physics that were put into the game and the lighting was also so well done and really made certain scenes scarier than they actually were, especially the scenes with Vader.\n\nI also really loved the menu of the game because I found that pressing the buttons was so satisfying. The Lightsaber Dojo was also one of my favorite experience and it really did make me feel like I was an actual Jedi lol. I wasn't expecting there to be more unlockable lightsabers ,so when I saw that there were lightsabers from the real characters of the Star Wars franchise, I lost it. I'm only at level 21 in the Dojo so I still got a long ways to go to unlock the bigger goodies but it is something that is fun to do while we wait for Episode 2. One thing that I thought was cool was that the lightsaber you pick in the dojo transfers to the lightsaber in the actual episode so you can flex on Vader's lightsaber.\n\nThis is a must buy for anyone with a Quest and you can't beat the price tag of $10.\n\nI can't wait for Episode 2 and also thank you ILMxLAB for such an amazing experience!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Alien.EightJul 9, 2019 at 11:49 AM\nA great intro into VR\n\nA quality game at a good price cant wait for the next one\n\nHelpful | 0", "Goel25May 22, 2019 at 2:14 PM\nBuy It!\n\nThis experience was absolutely incredible!

Even if you dont, this narrative driven experience is worth your time, and even more so if you do. From start to finish the experience is very engaging and really pulls you in. Great charter acting, environmental interaction and some decent combat. The story thread is great so far and Im excited for episode two. A couple of lower points would be that the combat is slim and a bit repetitive, and since this is more of a curated experience the game will force you into certain positions and very aggressively lets you know if you try to move out of your place by intrusively darkening the screen and pointing an arrow of where you are supposed to be. This doesnt feel natural and can break immersion. This experience also has me day dreaming of what a full game in this style could deliver.

Now I don't hold this against the game but it can be glitchy during the story, the main glitches I have to deal with may not even be the games fault but the quest itself, but in the dojo, in the later levels I find myself randomly being teleported to starting position. No I am not holding the home button(checked), some times it will take me to the quest home as if it crashed but when I open the game I am exactly where I was before.

You can switch between navigating via \"point and teleport\" and direct joystick control. I tried both and preferred the latter overall.\n\nI'm looking forward to some blasters and force powers in future episodes, but this was a fun slice of the universe, for a decent price.\n\nThe one real annoyance is the habit it has of blacking the screen out with a giant green arrow pointing the direction you should go as soon as you step out of the invisible (and usually very limited) zone they want you in during scripted moments. It totally breaks the immersion, and pops up without warning. It's particularly jarring when compared to the Guardian system which does a decent job of letting you know when you're straying too far without blocking the view around you.\n\nI hope the developers take a cue from there and loosen up the fence a bit across the board, and find a better, more subtle way of achieving it without the abrupt cut to black.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Willman21Jun 9, 2019 at 12:06 PM\nIf you ever wanted to wield a Lightsaber\n\nBasically why you Bought the Oculus Quest.

I was quite relieved when I found it was just this game, and not physical damage to my Quest. This was very distracting being always pasted onto your vision. I would have preferred to have my entire screen at the low resolution. I found myself examining these bizarre resolution edges far more than actually watching the episode. You will breeze through the entire episode well under an hour, and it leaves you with no reason to want to play again. There was nothing intriguing to me about the story. And no creative uses of the VR medium such as speaking in to the mic to say yes or no to NPCs, or interacting with any items in more of a sandbox style.

Well, I wanted the title to be: \"Imersive, beautiful, and SOMETIMES annoying\", it's got to do with the colliders and movement restriction. Way too many times are you forced to just stand still and wait, unable to move around. Also, instead of recognizing when you entered the elivator, it required you to stand im a SPECIFIC spot in the elivator, followed by restrictrd movement etc... and atleast for me, it didn't work to literally physically walk with my legs into that circle which I prefer, I had to move with the stick for it to work.\n\nAll in all though, great game, would recommend!

The combat towards the end was very lackluster and repetitive, the scenic cliff shots were pretty fake with fairly unconvincing draw distance backgrounds. There was some weird texture twitching based on draw distance. There is a scene where you are blocking the shots from storm troopers as you get further and further away, but man.. do the storm troopers look really bad and so unconvincing with lack of detail and shading. The more strange things were some slight bugs like missing a rung on a ladder all of a sudden I was clipped to outside the game and couldnt move until I closed and restarted. The worst is the twitchy tracking on the light saber in the dojo game and not being able to hit a target orb droid a few feet in front of me. The game is a step up from the experience at Star Tours at Disneyland so that is worth a few stars and that with the low price is okay, but there couldve been a bit more of a wow factor that would make this experience pop. I was hoping this would be a huge first good impression to give my friends to convince them the oculus quest is an awesome device but I found more wow factor in other game demos more than this.

That means no exploration on your own and no choices to make. You will move when and only when you are allowed to do so, you are not allowed to get too close to anything (lest a black screen appears and tells you to step back), and if someone hands you something it will become glued to your hand until the app allows you to remove it. In short, player agency and choice were apparently dirty words when this app was being designed. So youre left with an extremely limited and rigid experience that offers little to no replay value, aside from the lightsaber training dojo option. At $10, its one of the cheapest apps on the store right now, but still feels overpriced. The good news is that the experience is so short, you can probably complete the whole thing and return it for a refund.\n\nHelpful | 4", "kelvissuJun 1, 2019 at 7:02 PM\nNot Launching for me, what gives?\n\nI bought this, wanted to try playing it days ago.

Perhaps I'm just used to my Vive an PSVR with better graphics. I got the Quest for games like Beat Saber, which look fine on the Quest. This just look cheap. Low poly, low texture, few effects. I didn't even like the look of the lightsabers. The ones in Beat Saber look better. Vader was the only character who looks close to the right size. Everybody else looks tiny. It breaks the immersion. The whole thing is completely on rails too. I guess Star Wars fans like it judging from the ratings. I just don't get it.

All the other characters are forgettable, because the game is over before you to know any of them. The game-play is half walking around and climbing, and half watching cut-scenes. Walking around and climbing, is cumbersome because if you as much as grace the walls or misstep on a ladder, you a greeted by a \"move back into the world\" message. The cut-scenes feel weird because you can't move around. There is some combat game-play too, but getting hit doesn't damage you at all. The game is completely on rails, it doesn't even give you the chance too say no to vader for a brief moment.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ApollyonNMay 27, 2019 at 8:55 AM\nCompletely awsome... but short\n\nI will admit this is the first game I bought for my quest, and I'm very happy with the game, just sadly...its too short.

The story telling was extremely slow, not some much in dialogue, but in long waits in between things happening, ships docking, characters walking and out, etc. The interactive parts were interesting at times, but way too closely guided. During each of the puzzles a character stands over your shoulder, telling you how to solve it. Lots of just following characters from place to place. The light sabers were probably the best part, but even in that, there seemed to be no way to do it wrong.

I have no issue with length of the game (I can't verify as I have not played it all).\n\nMy issue is the controls. I appreciate there are some full locomotion options. However, they are a half measure. Smooth turning is not smooth turning in Vader immortal. It is 36 degree snap with a smooth rotation of each 36 degree turn.. why? That is just snap turning with extra steps. Forward as the head direction..good option for some but please allow us to turn that off. Again, customization is key. A slider for the smooth turn percent and speed of rotation would be greatly appreciated. Some people get motion sickness, for those who don't, we like proper free locomotion that is fully customizable.\n\nI'm sure the game is great, but I can't get immersed in a game with controls where I feel like my neck and spine are fused together turning as I look when moving my head. And then every turn is like a robot unable to slowly turn my head.. Panning the camera during a snap turn is not smooth turning, that's not how that works. I know with the quest you can turn yourself wire free but that isn't always an option.\n\nI'm hoping that more control options can added to Vader immortal and to future titles in the series. I'm not refunding the game because I dislike the controls, instead I'll keep it, not play it and hope that a future patch will bring better controls. I'm glad to support the development of great software... I'm just hoping that this support leads to better control customization in the future.
