Have some notes...\n\nGreat and accurate gameplay. User-friendly training interface makes it easy for anyone to learn to play.\n\nSometimes, the game glitches and freezes my oculus quest. In which case, I have to turn off my Quest by holding the power button then turn it back on to be able to use it again.\n\nMissions are great.\n\nFor anyone who wants to play, my advice:\n\n1. Do the training first\n2. After training is completed, do campaign missions with AI for practice\n3. When you feel youre ready, give the co-op mode a try.\n4. KNOW YOUR ROLE! Everyone thinks they are a jack of all trades when they first start for some reason. But thats clearly not the case. Choose a role that you are best at.\n\nThats it. Have fun gamers!!!\n\nHelpful | 3", "jpg689Jul 26 at 2:35 PM\nRequiring an active internet connection\n\nI think it's unfair for a game not to have a save feature when it also requires a constant connection to the internet. I've only been able to make it through the first level as the game tends to crash due to my Quest losing internet connectivity for a split second. Every time this happens I have to start all over again from the main menu. The game is tremendously fun, especially if you can find others to play with, but I found myself ready to uninstall it after only a couple hours due to the connectivity issue. A save feature really needs to be put into this game, in 2020 not having one is simply unacceptable.\n\nHelpful | 12", "PointBlanksMay 16 at 6:57 PM\nAwesome game but, no autosave??\n\nIve had this game for over a little under a year but, I cant seem to pass the first level.\n\nNot because I cant but, because I havent had the drive to sit through a whole level. The game doesnt allow you to save mid-way, nor does it autosave after a major event. Instead, you have to start over each time from the beginning and that turns into a bore really fast.\n\nThe feeling of being a captain is there. The multiplayer aspect too, just too bad it isnt PVP.\n\nAll-in-all, I love the game. It doesnt disappoint but, the autosave function is really a hindrance.\n\nAnd final complaint: Please bring back voice commands!\n\nHelpful | 188", "Jeaneenabean5 days ago\nFun\n\nThis is a really fun app, especially if playing with friends. Ive only played helm - it would be helpful to be able to punch in coordinates or to find a way to lock them in place instead of overshooting. Same with the speed - its just hard to get a specific number.\n\nWe also had challenges getting logged in as a group - sending friend requests is not inherently obvious.\n\nThe tactile feedback is really cool and its nice to be able to see everyone together - you really feel like a team.\n\nOne other thing - it would be great to set custom control heightlol. I finally get it perfect and have to set it up all over again next time I log in lol.\n\nThanks!!\n\nHelpful | 0", "gmaster755 days ago\nLogin troubles\n\nIve had no bad experiences with this game but the reason is because so far, I havent been able to play it theres the looping logo glitch but mine is that I cannot choose my actual Ubisoft account I have to link my oculus account with Ubisoft which when I attempt to do that it gives me an Unsupported post request gives me no further information and remember I have no prompt pop up to sign in to my Ubisoft account just tells me to link my Oculus account and then proceeds to tell me to go away I have already submitted support tickets to each company involved (Oculus and Ubisoft) and Oculus answered early giving me answers that sadly didnt work Im disappointed in the way you have to set up in this game and sad for it looks incredibly good.

When you get a full crew, who all at least somewhat know what they are doing, its a complete blast. But thats also its downfall. Its nearly impossible to get a full crew. At the beginning of this games life cycle on the quest, the devs made some mistakes, and the entire playerbase went under. You may find 1 or 2 people during prime time, but its hard to find a full lobby. The gameplay is amazing, but be weary of the player base.\n\nHelpful | 39", "vinegarshots15 days ago\nCan't launch without internet connection\n\nPreviously, this game used cloud functionality for voice command recognition. That functionality has since been removed, but for some reason, you still can't launch this game unless you have an active internet connection, even if you just want to play single player A.I. mode. Not acceptable.\n\nHelpful | 4", "RayAllenTaylorJun 4 at 12:27 PM\nLove it.. but...\n\nIt's my fav game at the moment.\nIt's somehow the only game I really feel immersed. Especially sitting in a chair with arm sides at the same hight as the captains seat.\nThe gragics are not the best, but full of details and live, which makes it totally enjoyable.\n\nBut it has problems.. really...\n\nThe worst; Keeps on crashing! Again and again and again.\nCombined with the not existing possibility to save in the middle of a mission, makes this game frustrating at times.\n\nIn the middle: the sound quits Evey now and then. Also , quirky background during the loading (colored pixel mess... )\n\nAt the end: playing alone is kind of boring. The missions have long traveling sequences, where nothing really is happening. Approaching another ship, satellite or what ever... It just takes time.\nI guess , playing it with others makes even this part fun.\n\nBut there is never someone else in any lobby.. so I keep on playing by myself... So there is an end time to this game for me, if there is not something special coming from the developers.\n\nI would love to play another role then the captain, so having an KI captain would be a start for me... or make more people play the game... How about making it free for a while, or create a demo for people to try the game... Or what ever... Just don't let it die, please.\n\nHelpful | 17", "cvinkerJul 17 at 4:42 PM\nGreat game but really...\n\nPlayed for about an hour then needed to pause to get something, resume to find it disconnected from internet and I lost all progress I made and had to start from the beginning.

When you get a good crew together and you play with the same intent, it's easily my favourite game on the Quest.\nI gave it 3 stars for one reason... To encourage the developers to continue building the game. Two components could be added, either of which would likely guarantee not only 5 star ratings everywhere, but probably expand the players exponentially.\n\nAway teams. PvP play.\n\nCan you imagine how great it would be to be able to play against other players, in Romulon or Klingon ships? To be able to beam down to a planet and conduct missions there? Or to do away team missions against other players??\n\nI generally hate paying for DLC, but I'd shell out a lot for those features quite happily.\n\nLet's hope the Dev's are working on this!\n\nHelpful | 305", "LeopardSauceJun 24 at 11:05 AM\nNeed internet to play offline?\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely incredible. So much fun, aside from one fatal flaw: when playing solo in \"offline mode\" you still need to be connected to the internet!? Spectrum has had a lot of outages in my area lately, so without autosave (as others have mentioned) it's nearly impossible to get through a full mission. As soon as you lose internet connection for even a second, it boots you from the *offline* game, doesn't save your progress, and sends you back to the main menu. Seriously infuriating, but once you've got a reliable connection this game has a lot of potential.\n\nHelpful | 3", "iangeoffreynelson15 days ago\nNot impressed\n\nI have played the game about 9 times and still have no idea what to do. At the point, my next step will to search online as to how to play the game. I wish this had voice controls do I could easily say ... Set a course for Riga 3 warp 2. Instead, I am searching ALONE trying to determine how to fly a starship. The graphics are good. I wish there were more instructions.\n\nHelpful | 2", "dancinggoat13 days ago\nLove it, but please fix it!\n\nWe really need an autosave for this game.

Since I already had one, no issues there. Once I start the game, I got a message saying that you need to log in to Ubisoft to play the game, and it only gives you one option: to press a button on the remote, which takes you out of the game in order to link your account. Once the account is linked, it takes you back to the game, only to find the same message. Over and over again. I tried more than 12 times. I contacted Ubisoft technical support and the CS agent unlinked my account and I tried it again to no avail. We spent an hour on this. In the end, he said he would need to escalate it to the Bridge Crew team, which was fine with me, until he mentioned that he would then get back to me via email. I asked about when I would expect a reply (tonight, 2 days, 3 days?) and he basically said all of the above or maybe longer. So now I have an app that can't be played although my account is linked. I deleted the game, installed it again, rebooted, also used my other 6 year old Ubisoft account, linked it and same thing happened.\n\nNOTE TO DEVELOPERS: Before you tell me to go to some link and download the Oculus Rift app, I do not own a Rift. I own a Quest. It's a self-contained device. Yes, I also have the Quest app on my phone. I have not seen an option to \"activate\" the game on the Oculus Quest app on my phone. Also, what good does it makes to download the Oculus Rift app on your computer? Which also leads me to the point that not everybody has a PC. Many people have Macs, so that renders the advice useless, as there's no Ocuus Rift app for Mac.

It takes some effort to learn each position, but once you do, they are each complex enough to be satisfying and simple enough to allow for fun banter. Each position has the autonomy to make independent decisions improving outcomes, but folks also have to coordinate their actions. By the end of a couple missions, it genuinely feels like our group of friends has been physically hanging out together. Please develop more games like this where people work together toward common goals.\n\nHelpful | 1", "thisisfoxxApr 17 at 5:24 PM\nFun... BUT\n\nThe other reviews speak the truth. The Ubisoft sign up process is a mess. Why replicate functionality that already exists on the Oculus?\n\nIt seems multiplayer will not work if you or your friends are in an Oculus party chat. This is the type of bug you get from unnecessarily replicating existing system functionality. If you and your multiplayer friends are in a voice chat, you must all leave the party, reboot your Oculus and then launch the game. Thats the only way I could get it to work.\n\nOnce up and running, the gameplay is actually very fun.

Surprisingly! Trek has a very consistent treatment of it's technologies and a lot of this is wrong. Confusingly bizarrely wrong. You don't need to drop shields to get a transport lock, only for transport. Shields don't take 15 seconds to raise. Impulse is for low-speed manoeuvring not traveling between planets a light-hour apart in 10 seconds with some kind of whooshing effect. And a neutral zone boundary doesn't cut through the middle of a star system, what are the planets meant to pass in and out of different territories as they orbit? And how could they get the Kobayashi Maru test so completely wrong? It's described in almost every incarnation of Trek.\n\nIf the game designers aren't trek fans, couldn't they get a consultant who is, and listen to them?\n\nLook: Startlingly ugly, just horrible. All the avatars have these horrific large scale patches of discoloration all over their skin and faces, everyone looks like they're bruised and injured from a fight or just filthily dirty. Everyone's skin is yellowish or brownish tinted. It's AWFUL. It may be a cosmetic issue only but it really really matters, the core gameplay is interacting with people, and they all look like abused corpses, it's distressing. And there's something seriously weird about the inverse kinematics, your avatar's arms seem to be connected to your neck just below your ears. Character design badly needs input from a professional designer, it doesn't look like they used one.\n\nUsability: I tried being at helm, the hardest thing is trying to orient the ship using a virtual D-Pad. But the controller the player is holding in their have has one right under their thumb, why can't I use it? It's almost impossible to press the all-stop button without putting the ship into reverse, the controls overlap each other. I did the tutorial for Engineering, what's this nonsense about \"rerouting\" being some kind of special mode different and with a different interface to normal routing of power? It's it because they wanted extra busy work for that player and couldn't think of anything else?\n\nIn general though, menus shown to the user are missing options, the menu raised by the controller's menu button don't help with the menus you see in front of you, trying to find a friend and start a game is just arcane, I got it once but I'm not sure I could do it again I'm pretty sure it didn't involve the waiting room feature that seems to be there for that purpose. There is no clear distinction between missions and ongoing missions and your choice of ship is limited to the Kelvin one on one mode but not the other, and there's no tutorial for the TOS ship or the TNG ship and all the controls throughout the game are confusing and badly labeled (eg: If a section is marked \"Power\", don't write \"Shield Power\" in that sideways text between controls, at minimum just write \"Shields\" so it's easier to read, and even better, don't use sideways text on controls!). And since, as I said above, the game doesn't follow Trek lore as per the shows and movies, you can't figure all the controls out yourself.\n\nAnd it bugs me, it really bugs me, that the Trek insignia in the loading screen is drawn not-quite-right, it's maybe close to TOS badge but curved wrong? I bet they paid through the nose to get the Star Trek rights, couldn't they use the correct Star Trek assets? It's a poor way to start the game. It's sadly indicative of the respect paid to Trek in the whole game.\n\nHelpful | 17", "Bignut239 days ago\nI cant Link my Ubisoft account\n\nI tried searching all over the Internet and its not working for me so if someone can help me out that be great\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper Response6 days ago\n\nBignut23, thank you sharing your review!

I cannot stress enough that this is NOT the case. Load times are perfectly adequate and linking a Ubisoft account takes less than 3 minutes (assuming you can remember your details).\n\nBeyond this, the gameplay is phenomenal! One of the best purchases I've made on Quest! I'm not even a huge Star Trek fan; this game immersive and entertaining regardless.\n\nThe one potential downside for some users is the multiplayer experience.

You really feel like you're sitting on the bridge of the Enterprise. It's a trekkie's dream. However, when I purchased this game, I could not get one of the primary features to work, so I contacted Ubisoft support to see if they could help. It's a question that should have been resolved in 24 hours. That was more than three weeks ago. First of all, there wasn't even dedicated support for the Quest version (seriously, it wasn't even an option in the \"platform\" menu). Second, I kept having to tell support the same things over and over because they didn't bother actually paying attention to the issue. And now I've dealt with more than two weeks of radio silence, all because I want to know how to fix a MAIN FEATURE OF THE GAME. So while the game itself is fun, my experience with Ubisoft has not been. Rarely have I encountered a company with such obvious contempt for its customers. Trust me on this: The game is fun, but you'd better hope you don't have any issues with it, because once Ubisoft has your money, they don't care whether the product they sold you actually works as advertised.\nUPDATE: Ubisoft finally responded to me, by saying that IF they bother fixing the issue, they'll post about it on the forums. So their solution is to be silent for three weeks, then tell me that the onus is on me to find the solution to an issue they caused, IF they bother fixing it. Again, the game is fantastic. Ubisoft customer support is the worst I have ever experienced. Their contempt for their customers is unreal.\n\nHelpful | 23", "UGC-ARCHANGELJun 21 at 3:09 AM\nIt wont link my Ubisoft account\n\nI was really looking forward to the gameplay but I cant get past the link your Ubisoft account and I think that part is really dumb and they should remove that part if they do that is a 5 stars for me\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 7 at 2:38 PM\n\nUGC-ARCHANGEL, thank you sharing your review!

A lot of the reviews I read said that the gameplay was awesome but there was no auto save and the player base sucked. Its true there is no odyssey once you get into a mission you have to finish it you do not have to do the tutorial every time. Once you finish your mission you can replay it or move onto the next. The missions are not that long and theyre a lot of fun. You can play with people who have PlayStation VR and I think different VR systems on computers. I have had this game for one night I spent half of it playing through the solo missions after I had a good feel for the controls I tried going online. I ended up playing from 3 AM to 8 AM. The people I found online were patient and nice and taught me how to play. All in all I probably played this game for 12 hours straight and I had a blast. My one and only criticism and its not a complaint or criticism is that when youre playing online the captain position doesnt have a lot to do. However if you have a captain who knows the other stations like the back of his hand he has a lot to do. One of the players I found was Captain and he was telling me how to reroute sub systems on engineering what heading he won at the helm what he wanted shot at how much power he wanted to each system. All in all this game is not perfect but I would give it five stars I loved it if I wasnt so tired I would still be playing it now. Awesome game definitely recommend.\n\nHelpful | 1", "RiverHuntedFeb 24 at 6:45 AM\nStar trek : is bridge crew\n\nThe game itself isn't that bad, but the problem is that Ubisoft made it, making it extremely painful to setup. The normal Joe will not be able to pass the registration setup, and will drain most very experienced gamers. For the few people that will succeed, most will have lost interest by the time they can finally make it work, and then still got to spend a few more hours to figure out to invite friends, and make the friend creating process work....

So you can imagine my surprise when it released on the Quest natively about a week later.\nThe login bug while troubling was an easy oversight to make given the nature of the problem, and easily worked around by resetting the browser app or the Quest after the initial setup. After that the game is awesome. Slight graphics downgrade from PCVR but so fun, even with AI, as you bark out commands and run intense yet cognitively intriguing game scenarios.\nTonight I actually played with a random group of four, and we would do retrospectives after failed missions, trying to determine what went wrong, how we could perform each of our duties better, and in general how to improve and become a more cohesive bridge team. This is a totally unique experience and is one of the best use cases for the quest hardware.

Nearly all of the players I've interacted with are passionate, friendly, and are just as willing as you to buy into being crew on a Starfleet vessel. Even players who admit they've never watched Star Trek find themselves tacking \"Captain\" onto their sentences. The base game could use some improvements, but if you're a fan of Star Trek, buy this for the experience.\n\n- Ubisoft accounts: Create one beforehand on your phone (use desktop mode in your browser) or PC. The Ubisoft account creation site is pretty bad, which is probably why trying to do it in-headset (or on your phone) is so awful.\n\n- Avatar customization: options aren't great. Not a huge selection. Only \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" options, and if you pick feminine, it makes your character wear a dress. You can't adjust facial features and skin color separately - there are four sliders that, as far as I can tell, adjust your avatar between white/black/West Asian/East Asian. As in, it adjusts both the skin color and facial features to... broad stereotypes for each. It's not a great choice on Ubisoft's part.\n\n- Issues with players: If you choose the captain role, you have the power to kick players from missions, but the crew cannot vote to kick the captain. There is also no way I've found to report players in-game, despite Ubisoft telling me otherwise when I submitted a ticket to report the one toxic captain I encountered.\n\n- Why isn't there an input to do a Vulcan salute??\n\nHelpful | 1", "doraemoJul 18 at 7:11 AM\n\nThis game shows a lot of team work and it's fun to play with people.\n\nHelpful | 0", "OdinTheOdiousDec 18 at 8:58 AM\nTerrible Ubisoft integration\n\nStar Trek Bridge Crew has given me by far the worst experience to date on the Quest.

This required multiple reboots etc. I've worked in IT for decades so god only know how someone with less IT experience will get on. I've side loaded games that were developed in the 1990's on the Quest and they've worked like clockwork. How this nonsense can be allowed on the actual Quest store is beyond me. It's a shame as I'm sure the game itself will be a lot of fun.\n\nI had a problem with my Quest library not displaying after installing STBC. It was because I had been signed out of the Internet on the Quest. Check if that is the case in settings.

This is really cool and up to expectations with just 2 notes: I) the word recognition could be a bit smarter. I speak fluent English without an accent but the sw is so sensitive that some sentences (like everything with the word WARP) really get stuck often. II) I am sure that rewriting the code for Quest was a huge deal. Just for this a bit of a refurbishment of the graphics could have been included.

The tutorial gives great explanations of the roles of each crew member but does not give great advice on the practical functions of each button or give any scenario advice. I wish there was a simulation mode where you could hone your dog fighting skills or something. The campaign missions are fun enough that there are missions which stress each role differently. Some missions are heavily focused on combat, so tactical is always working. The next mission might focus on avoiding detection which allows engineer and helm to work harder. I enjoy the diversity. Each mission aside from maybe one emphasizes teamwork.\nAfter you finish campaign it is easy to replay them and enjoy the on going voyage missions over and over.\n\nThere are some improvements that could be made.

Having played for a few hours, I am somewhat disappointed. Here are my observations:\n\n1. Typical of Ubisoft a Uplay account is required in order to play. This seems unnecessary as the Quest headset is a uniquely identifiable device. It also adds complication because of poor integration with the game (you have to switch to the browser to create/link a Uplay account).\n\n2. In-Game Connection issues. I've only had the game a few days and am currently just playing solo (using 'AI's). However, I am having frequent connection dropouts ending up with being booted to the start screen , losing any progress made. This significantly reduces any enjoyment. Checking my wifi connection each time, there is no issue so this must be the Uplay servers (maybe high load due to the time of year). Another reason a perm internet connection is a bad requirement.\n\n3. Voice control is laughable (think voice control around early 2000s). If this is the only reason for the insistence on an internet connection when solo, then I'd happily ditch voice control.\n\n4. Graphics resolution is too low. I can live with low polygon graphics, and even cartoonish shading. However, the graphics resolution in this port is so low that it's often difficult to read text (I vital element of the game) even when moving your head close to the text.\n\nI hope improvements are made to make this the enjoyable experience it should be for Star Trek fans, but being Ubisoft, I'm not too optimistic about that.\n\nGive it a go if you like Star Trek, but set your expectations to 'pretty lights' and not 'stun'.\n\nHelpful | 6", "ken666Dec 21 at 3:01 PM\nGood game/poor textures\n\nStar Trek Bridge is one of the best multiplayers experience on the Quest but the lazy graphics conversion of the game ruined everything.

That's because people can't figure out how to get past the ubisoft login screen. If you played the Rift version, you will know you need a working ubi account. You can set it up and test your login here for the Quest version https://account.ubisoft.com/en-US/login. Once you confirm you can login, start the game and login. It will log you in but never connect you. Reboot the Quest and it starts fine every time after that.\n\nEverything works exactly the same as the Rift version amazingly. You even get all the DLC. However, it has that familiar \"just good enough\" graphics you get from a PC to Quest port (just like Robo Recall).\n\n4 stars because it's a solid game and its cross play.\n\nHelpful | 3", "atirathaDec 20 at 8:45 AM\ndisappointed in gfx, otherwise fun\n\nLifelong trekkie here and been hoping this gets released on Quest, so extremely happy it did, but running it... I don't mind the Ubisoft account. The missions are quite fun and have that Trek spirit, but my qualms are - forgettable music (member Starfleet Academy? Member Klingon Academy? Yeah, I member) and the graphics looks actually worse than Bridge Commander from 2002,which to be honest, I think we can do better than that. Very low res textures make this look like Quake 3 engine game like Voyager Elite Force and the terrible aliasing everywhere really breaks the immersion.

For me it took about 15 minutes, and Im under the impression I got lucky with fewer problems than most people, get it was still annoying. When you spend $30 on a game, you expect a seamless experience. On that note, once you finally start to play, that is the experience you get. The gameplay was smooth, the multiplayer element was superbly immersive, and I feel I can play this game for hours and forget Im grounded on Earth. It reminds me of the Black Mirror episode USS Calister. The controls for each role on the ship is very sophisticated, to the point where you will really feel you are on board. This game really deserves some more credit.\n\nI also believe this would be an amazing game to support hand tracking, as 100% of core gameplay is using your hands to navigate panels.\n\nHelpful | 1", "VerbalDropDec 18 at 8:02 AM\nPretty fun, but...\n\nSo, first off the way to fix the log in problems is to log in as normal, then restart your quest while it is loading.

It would be better if there was a way to set a specific bearing and elevation in a similar manner as the speed.\n\nRegarding the ubisoft UPlay linking trash, I was able to avoid issues by following the advice of other reviewers.

Learning the different stations and expanding on this with multi player options is fun and exciting except for when I realize how poor the graphics are in this game. This may partially be because Oculus Quest does not allow us to increase graphics quality, but even with that major flaw in the oculus quests development, as well as the non-focus flaw they carelessly did not include in the Quest, even the folks at UbiSoft could had done a better job with the quality of graphics.... it is deeply disappointing and difficult to immerse for those of us that are visual players as well as strategic, to step out of the fact we are looking more or less at a 3D cartoon with poorly rendered textures and more or less pretty much visual blah.\n\nI would be more than happy to change this review if they can improve significantly the graphics quality and as a side not to OculusQuest: GIVE US THE OPTION TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF OUR GRAPHICS DISPLAY.

I think the textures and quality could be far superior and still run quite well as compared to other games Ive played.\n\nFor example, the control console in front of you has a very poor image quality, and this is the main object youre interacting with. The words at times lack so much sharpness the ya Reinhard to read.\n\nThe hand interaction is also quite weak. For example, to interact you squeeze the trigger when your on screen finger is positioned over the correct menu button, and then then your virtual finger moves strangely down instead of forward into the option selected.

I like how you play the Captain but can jump to a station if you want to perform specific tasks yourself. The AI crew does a great job with the orders you give them, so I tend to just let them do what they do.\n\nEverything from the Start Menu to the sounds are done well in this game. Dont expect to be Kirk out of the gate. This game rewards experience and can be deeply gratifying for a Star Trek fan.\n\nThis is a must buy.\n\nHelpful | 8", "MagnusHawkJan 18 at 3:09 PM\nAwesome Game\n\nI have some swiveling bar chairs and they make this game for me and for get together a over coop.

Really disappointed there was no info about how this feature works in the tutorial, or elsewhere.\n\nTrying to figure out how to contact Ubisoft support was a pain. Then the Oculus Quest isn't even an option for platforms in the help section, so I had to pick PS4 to send my support request.

This is the time people will be needing the most help with bugs and technical issues. Seems like a pretty big oversight.\n\nI'm really disappointed with how limited the play area is in this game. I lean my head back to admire the ceiling \"out of bounds\". I get my face within a foot of the control panel for a closer look \"out of bounds\". I lean too far in any direction \"out of bounds\". I've never felt so restricted in a VR game.\n\nI never notice any network issues in other games, but during my few hours in Bridge Crew I was taken out of my game multiple times to a separate screen to be informed I had lost connection. this often resulted in me being booted to the main menu screen losing all my progress.

Beyond expectations, a title apparently beyond the capabilities of the Quest dropped into the store. Not only that but it is what I had hoped.

It is extremely accurate and true to the shows. The original Enterprise, and my favourite, Enterprise D, are perfectly recreated and have all the functionality of their on-screen counterparts.\n\nYou can play solo with an AI crew, or play up to 4 player online games for the ultimate Star Trek RPG experience.\n\nAside from the 6 story mode missions that average 30 minutes each, there's procedurally generated missions that provide unlimited replayability.\n\nYou don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this game, but if you are a hardcore fan you will need extra underwear to play.\n\nIt seems that everyone that gave a one star rating had trouble creating a Ubisoft account, which is required to play. All I can say is that they're idiots. It was a very simple process that only took a couple of minutes.\n\nI really hope Ubisoft expand on this game with more features, like away missions, more ships (like Voyager, enemy ships, shuttlecraft) and more complex story missions.

Controls take a few time to get familiar with, remembering who does what, what you can do as captain vs other roles and what not. graphics are pretty good for a quest game. Its engaging and fun. I have only tested the 1 player campaign.\nThe drawback is absolutely the battery drain. I had a full charge(2 different times) and got 42 min of game play the 2nd time playing it and 47min of gameplay the 3rd time. (1st time i launched it i was already at 40% so didnt count that). There are no other games or apps running in the background. I barely finished the 2nd mission when my quest cut off due to 0%. I asked for a refund but I guess I was just over the 2 hour limit of game play.\nThis really is tragic as its a pricey game that plays well as a port, and had potential. The idea of getting 4 people together to play for 45min just seems like it would be frustrating as it would leave you wanting to play more but having to stop because you quest died (I have a battery back up mod, but honestly every other game on my quest has 2.5-3 hours of gameplay unless its rec room , that plays for about 1.5-2 hours before full drain) Disappointed in the drain and really dont want to be near the end of a mission to have the quest just die and log me out, thus failing to complete the mission.\nAlso if you have to take it off to use the restroom or something like that and your occulus goes into sleep mode, it logs you out of the servers, having to relog into them and start over is annoying as well.\n\nHelpful | 2", "brian.gilligan.35Dec 16 at 9:47 PM\nUbisoft login messed up\n\nI had to install the game, go to log in my Ubisoft account, uninstall and then reinstall to get the game working.

The ultimate Star Trek dream is to be on the bridge of a starship...especially if that ship is the Enterprise, right? This game *is* that experience. It's the VR version of that fantasy you've had since you were a kid.\n\nEven better though...the whole point is to do it with other people...and that's where this game *really* shines in my opinion. First of all, while there's enough complexity and sci-fi woo-woo involved at each station on the bridge to keep any Trek fan happy, none of it is so technically engrossing that you ever forget that what you're really doing is hanging out and having a good time with other people. As a pure social experience, this game is one of the best I've seen in VR.\n\nAs far as actual game play goes, each station has a well-balanced set of capabilities, and to play *effectively* you and your friends are going to have to communicate and coordinate your actions, which again, is a big part of the appeal for me. Every station is an integral part of the whole. No one station is all that hard to figure out, but there are layers of complexity here for the \"serious\" player that wants to master things.\n\nA final point, just to address all the 1-star reviews I'm seeing here. Every single one I've noticed has been about the, (admittedly fairly shaky), Uplay integration. I'll admit that part kind of sucks.

Today I completed the Kobayashi Maru with three people I just met, saving about 76 people before we were destroyed by Klingons. We investigated distress signals, beamed up people trapped on stranded ships, navigated though minefields, warped to distant star systems, and fought both pirates and Klingons. You do have to log into a Ubisoft account to play, but I had absolutely no problems and was logged in within 20 seconds. The visuals are a little rougher than the PC version of the game, but this is the complete game with no other compromises, and it includes the DLC for free.

I, like most, had issues connecting with Ubisoft as well as felt a little jaded at having to login to a third party account to play the game - Ive never been a fan of this practice for any game or platform. That being said, alls I had to do was reset my quest after creating my account and logging in. With the incovience aside and about an hour and half of playtime - this game is awesome! I have pretty much only gone through the tutorial but I am very impressed with the game. Graphics are decent could be better and the game seems quite expansive. Controls work nicely with my own slight complaint would be maybe add an option to point and click rather than putting your finger over an in game option then hitting the trigger. That current way of selection does feel odd but overtime I did get used to it and also wondered if there was a benefit since a lot of the buttons were close by and I could see one accidentally clicking something with out the added step of hitting the trigger.

What he says really works.)\n\nEDIT (2019-12-18): I'm sorry The following step-by-step guide to get Bridge Crew for just the half of the price is obsolete. I recently noticed that Ubisoft increased the price in their own store to 24,99  (instead of 7,50  as mentioned below). Maybe just wait a few weeks (or months?) until Ubisoft lowers the price again. For that case I won't delete the following instructions:\n\n1. Go to store.ubi.com and buy Bridge Crew for the platform \"VR - Oculus\"\n2. The price is 7,50 , currently. Put it into your cart.\n3. Go to your shopping cart and spot the link for adding a promo code (in German it's \"Code einlsen\").\n4. Enter \"EXTRA20\" and apply the code. The price goes off to 6,00 .\n5. Complete the checkout and pay the 6 bucks.\n6. You'll get a mail for successful purchase. Also you'll get a mail with an activation key.\n7. Copy that key and go for redeeming that code: https://secure.oculus.com/redeem-code/\n8. Then you can go to the Quest store and you will notice that Bridge Crew only costs 9,99 !\n9. Get it for just 10 bucks. Et voil, you only paid 15,99  in total!\n\nBesides, I never expected this game to be published for the Quest. Was a pretty awesome surprise! I am very excited to play more than just the tutorial (I didn't have enough time for more, though).\n\nA dream comes true.

If you dont you will be waiting for a long long time.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Roxtar73Dec 18 at 7:31 AM\nSpace Quest here we come!\n\nFirst things first. Do you have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this game? No. If you have never heard of Star Trek before that wouldnt hamper the fun this game has to offer. Now does it help? Immensely. Not that it changes the game in any way, what it does do is it make me you feel like you are on the bridge of a Starfleet Starship and a little kid.\n\nThe controls are simple and you can always pull up an overlay that tells what each button does. Once you get the hang of all four stations (Engineering, tactical, helm, and captain) its time to jump online and play a match or two. If you are lucky or In a private group the game is super fun as everyone is doing their part and it all just works.\n\nTake away the Star Trek name and the iconic ships and what you are left with is a great space navy sim. Great game!\n\nI really hope they decide to make\nDS9 & Voyager DLC\n\nIn conclusion I would say this is a five star game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "foxzimmDec 16 at 9:09 PM\nAmazing!!!\n\nSo great so far! Definitely new to the Quest and in need of some updates at the moment, but so good once you get going! After linking a Uplay account, you need to reset the headset and it will work. It also will not let you play when you are in a party. The reason being is you have to use an in game voice chat, which is all good, but you need to reset the game if you were in a party on boot. So a couple of technical things, but Im sure the first few updates will take care of that. They definitely are not game breaking. Once you are in it is just incredibly fun and has a whole lot of content for a VR game.

Went through the same process as everyone else except it took me less than 5 minutes. All you do is link your Ubisoft account and let the pulsating logo display for about 10seconds and just power down and power up your Oculus Quest. Simple.

Ran through training as captain then went to play solo, you know to learn the ropes. Some how through testing my mic I ended up as the engineer in a multiplayer game without the faintest clue what I was doing. The guys in the game takes me through it and we somehow despite my incompetence survived the mission. Really great experience and very glad to have finally got to play it, suspect I may loose a few hours to this one!\nLinking to a Ubisoft account is a bit clunky but worked ok for me after a headset reset. Put in my details to link then had the Ubi logo loading for ages, after a couple of minutes I gave up and restarted the headset loaded the game and I was logged in despite it not seeming like the linking accounts had ever gone through. I would normally drop at least a star for : 1 the clunky way it half works to log in, 2: The fact you have log in at all but I think a lot of the reviews are being very harsh on what is a good port.\n\nAll in all if you wanna go do some nerdy fun coop gaming on your quest this is the way to go.\n\nHelpful | 0", "TheChillOOFFeb 21 at 3:55 PM\nmy dad has stolen my vr headset\n\nthis game made my dad steal my vr headset\n\nHelpful | 0", "schuhbox20Dec 19 at 8:38 PM\nUnplayable due to Uplay/Oculus issues\n\nUn Believable that a massive company like Ubisoft cant figure out how to make their online login work before they release such a huge game.

When I try to login it says the browser is unrecognized and I get an email with a six digit code asking me to enter it... somewhere. Theres no link, after searching for nearly forty minutes Ive come no closer to an answer about where this code goes, so I cant play the game at all for entirely asinine reasons.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJan 10 at 10:34 AM\n\nSpamcan01, thank you for posting about this and I'm sorry to see that you've been having an issue with accessing your game!
