Not worth the money . There's way cheaper games with way better quality Actually there's free games that are better than this. Play a PC novel instead. Just look up \"The best anime visual novels\" close your eyes and pick. And whatever you pick I guarantee it's cheaper and better than this CRAP\n\nLONG REVIEW: This game cost 40, when all it is, is 3D texture's talking,standing and sitting. There's barely any interaction. The story is bland and uninsteresting and a lot of it could of been removed or written better.\nThe character's are all tell and don't show. Green haired lady is so smart and never wrong, purple haired femboy is a leader like and instead of experiencing these features it's told to you when a character is acting strange or themselves. Why?? Because the character's are not written well, nothing is! The game is trailered to make it seem like it's a mystery, interactive novel but it's not. AND WHY THE F--K DO I HAVE HANDS IF THEY'RE JUST FOR DECORATION 95% OF THE TIME!?!?\n\nHelpful | 65", "haloff11Mar 1 at 4:59 AM\nWorth 40 if you like books/visual novel\n\nI cleared all endings. It took me about 15-20 hours.\n\nThe game is like a visual novel but with 3D models instead of 2D pictures. For those who don't know, think of it as a book with voices, musics and pictures. There are some animations (just a little) though.\n\nThe graphics are nice, just like an anime. I personally didn't really enjoy the characters design, but it's a matter of personal taste. The 3D model are sufficiently detailed but I found the backgrounds lacking.\n\nThe voice acting is superb! The OST and the musics are absolutely wonderful. I can't find a single minus about it.\n\nSince this is a visual novel, let's talk about the most important thing : the story. I can't say any spoiler, but I found it great. At least on par with very good visual novels/ books. It's like a mystery novel. While playing I managed to guess many things, but I also got things wrong. The story is quite emotional and serious. The true ending was so beautiful. I got teary eyes, which almost never happen...\n\nThere are next to no choices, unfortunately.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the skip function. It allows you to skip scenes you already saw, but it works by scene and not by sentence. If there is just one sentence that differs, then you can't use the skip function.\n\nIn term of immersion, does VR bring something?\nYES! Definitely. You definitely feel more immersed in the story despite the lack of interaction. If there were much more interactions and choices, it would be so much better, but I understand the time and the budget of the developers are limited.\n\nConclusion : do I recommend it?\n\nMust-buy:\nIf you like visual novel.\nIf you like anime and reading.\n\nRecommended:\nIf you like anime.\nIf you like reading.\n\nNot recommended:\nIf you don't like reading.\nIf you hate anime.\n\nI complained a fair bit, but I still think very highly of the game. It's definitely worthy of 5 stars considering the price. At least to me.\n\nPS: Ending A is best ending. Ahahahhaah!\nMy dearest,!\n\nHelpful | 118", "alymanor2005May 27 at 9:55 AM\nBest Game Ever\n\nI have never played such a fun and detailed game on vr before.There is plenty of story and things to do even after you \"finish\" the main story line it still keeps you intrigued\n\nHelpful | 3", "sieraashleyalvarezMay 14 at 2:24 PM\nIf you enjoy reading anime\n\nI just wish it was more interactive like you can make decisions and explore more of a game really.

The story is great and the VR makes you feel like you're really one of the characters, in the middle of the plot. Also, I don't know why some people criticize the 3D character design, I love it!\n\nEdit 2: I've finished it. Unlocking the true ending had me stumped for a bit, but it was obvious in retrospect. I confirm my  rating! This is a piece of art and literature, well worth the price. I'm now looking forward to whatever MyDearest has in store next!\n\nHelpful | 10", "pokemonthebombMar 21 at 8:32 PM\nBroke my heart and put it together again\n\nThe stories in this Visual Novel are so well told you'll become addicted after just chapter 1 and your heart may break in some parts but other parts put it together again I finished it and I have to say I loved this and I'm sure you will too\n\nHelpful | 9", "hihiRApr 7 at 7:52 PM\nI love it so much\n\nI don't write review usually, but it's really a great story, worth spending your time and money to enjoy it.\n\nAlso, the songs are really really nice!\n\nThanks for being this nice game to us.\nIf you love Japanese story game, you must love it!\n\nHelpful | 3", "DragonNZJan 28 at 7:04 AM\nSurprisingly good!\n\nId first like to say that if you are unfamiliar with visual novels then this might not be a good product for you. However, if youve already given 2d VNs a go and you want to mix things up, then this game is definitely for you.\n\nOne thing to note is that there are choices in the game but it takes a pretty long time before they start showing up.\n\nHelpful | 33", "taarraasMay 16 at 10:19 AM\n\nGood story\n\nHelpful | 2", "RauelRualbeApr 1 at 10:17 PM\nPerspective geometry distortion\n\nSeems like it might be a good story and the art work is nice but the perspective and geometry are so distorted that it makes me feel quite ill. Been using VR for 9 months and nothing else has ever made me feel so ill. Thinking about trying to get a refund I would be close to two hours if not already over just to get through the first section and I don't know if I can get used to it?\n\nHelpful | 3", "MetalNekomataApr 30 at 3:10 PM\nHope to see more from this company\n\nThis is the next level of immersion for visual novels. I hope more developers get inspired by this.\n\nHelpful | 1", "TriAnarchyJun 22 at 1:56 PM\nA Masterpiece\n\nTokyo Chronos is a Visual Novel, for anyone not family with the genre, it is a choose your adventure type story, where you mostly watch the actions with occasional choices that direct the story. I am going to break this review into 2 parts: story and VR experience..\n\n\nStory: no matter how pretty a visual novel is, storytelling is central to its quality and Tokyo Chronos absolutely shines. On the surface would describe it as a sci-fi murder mystery, but it is so much more than that, it is every genre possible, something only Sheakspears Hamlet could achieve. It is powerful and moving, the story is original and it doesnt feel forced. The game provides tremendous character depth, it allows you to compare how one sees themself and how others see the same person. The contrast is beautifully done. The ending is very satisfying and not what you think it is.\n\n\nVR experience: The game is absolutely beautiful. The characters are beautifully designed, and you genuinely feel close them. The environment is absolutely incredible. I think I will re-play the game just so I can look around myself in some of the settings.\n\nI am so glad i got this, an absolute most for any visual novel fan, and anyone who enjoys good storytelling in a new immersive environment.\n\nHelpful | 1", "BeastMode0501Apr 18 at 12:23 AM\nGreat Game\n\nThis is one of the best virtual novels Ive ever played. Highly recommend!!!\n\nHelpful | 1", "itistimetosueFeb 18 at 5:45 PM\nAmazing\n\nIve tried a few visual novels, but those were mainly dating sims and while the stories were good they were never amazing.

I grew up watching anime, Dragon Ball (Z, GT), Inuyasha, Naruto, etc... this blew me away with character design, music, environment, and feeling like the character that I was enveloped in. I could find myself thinking the very words he would say next. If you are into anime with an interesting story and a strange scary world. Welcome. This story will make you look over your virtual shoulder, you feel watched. Youll also feel connected to your cast of friendly, funny, charming, and very well written characters. They are amazingly rendered; their models are crazy to look at if youve always watched anime. To finally be in an anime in this way was enough to make me tear up. Thank you to the staff, developers, and sponsors; just everyone that helped put this together. To everyone else; please try the game its 40$ for an experience that will stick with you for a very long time.\n\nHelpful | 40", "Arthands_VROct 20 at 8:23 AM\nGreat story with translation issues\n\nIt has great and touching story but there are many translation issues. This is a visual novel with very minimal interaction so take note. It last about 15 to 20 hrs as claimed, with alternate paths and B side stories. If you want some mystery story do check out this title\n\nHelpful | 26", "bk227865Nov 12 at 2:05 PM\ngoes down the drain at the end.\n\nThere are a lot of motionless, and even black, screens with just text in one of the story arc's at the end. There is little or no VR enhancement in those parts. Did they ran out of budget to do that part properly ?\n\nIn the Description of the game it states \"To kill, or not to kill  YOU decide. \"\nSo why can't i ? The decision is forced ?\n\nFor the few locations they have in the game the textures really should be better that this.\n\nI would like to see more polished versions of these kind of games though.\n\nHelpful | 34", "this_uwuJan 14 at 6:48 PM\nI FREAKIN love it\n\nEverything is there for the perfect visual novel\n\nHelpful | 5", "XephyrioJan 2 at 1:47 AM\nLack of choices\n\nThough sure \"great vr experience\", the storyline is WAY too linear to feel truly involved, so in my opinion it is too overpriced for a \"pretty\" looking story with little involvement in its development....\n\nHelpful | 2", "OstisomaNov 24 at 10:15 PM\nOverpriced...\n\nHoped for some real VR interactions and wished they could animate the characters actions more (i.e. actually walking towards you) rather than using static representation. It doesnt need to be a VR game for 99% of the story.\nThe volume of the game is pretty good, but the plot isn't very reasonable (the characters decisions are pretty strange, like why would you ever want to do that? which, distance me from the story progress). Also the writing doesn't seem to be very polished.\nOverall, the quality was not as good as I expected. The scale of the models are off (way too big). The plot couldnt move me much simply because of the not very well thought story delivery. I will just hide everything from you and reveal them one by one rather than leaving ambiguous traces pointing to many different possibilities (though the ending is pretty good). The volumes of different characters speaking sound different to me...but I do like the stereo sounding. I personally do not enjoy the protagonist. The in-game op ed movies are pretty cool to watch. The game has both the best voice actors and some bad ones (especially the protagonist).\nIts a good game but could have been better. I give 4/5 because Im a broody person so I should add 1 point back to offset the strengths of the game that I overlooked.\n\nHelpful | 13", "KoverathJun 21, 2019 at 7:15 AM\nExcellent Visual Novel\n\nAt around 20 hours long, 7 routes to play through and around 5000 lines of Japanese dubbed dialogue, yes this Visual Novel is worth the asking price. I dont want to spoil anything but the story is great and youll have to play all the routes to unlock all the mysteries.\n\nHelpful | 44", "agitokazuJun 19, 2019 at 6:27 PM\nAn awesome VN\n\nA pretty cool visual novel built for VR in mind..\nYes its pricey, but it has a good story. Art is great too... cant wait to see more VNs in the future\n\nHelpful | 154", "grizzlepawJun 21, 2019 at 6:38 AM\nDecent story, no dub\n\nDecent story and environments, personally I think it would be more enjoyable if there was an option for an English dub.\n\nHelpful | 81", "MarkSpurrellJun 25, 2019 at 8:14 AM\n\nIn a word, Tokyo Chronos was a little disappointing. It benefits very little from being a VR game. Besides being able to look around, there is no interaction with the world around you. Your hands feel useless, and even if you did want to walk around, the game stops you from walking more than a few feet forward. The locations are few and far in between, and they are not great environment renders either. As for the story, Id rather not talk too much about it as I only finished one ending thus far. But the writing was decent and the concept is interesting. Voice acting was also great. Its just let down by the poor 3D environments and lack of any true VR engagement. Where I thought this game would innovate the visual novel medium, Tokyo Chronos just feels like more of the same. 3/5\n\nHelpful | 60", "VoidChronosJun 26, 2019 at 5:24 AM\nGood Visual Novel, Mediocre VR Game\n\nTokyo Chronos feature good voice acting (Japanese only), captivating mystery, and good writing.\n\nBut the most disappointing thing is the lack of VR interactivity. The only captivating moments, that are only possible thanks to VR are personal close-up conversations. Unfortunately, even there they've missed a great opportunity by using default standing Player model, even while text references otherwise.\nI really hope there would be a visual novel that can incorporate VR concepts better.\n\nHelpful | 21", "Starship_HermitJul 22, 2019 at 7:06 PM\nVR is a Great Storytelling Medium\n\nThis title has been quite enjoyable, as I search for more laid-back titles on the Quest platform. Works well standing or sitting. The overall story is alright, though I find it far more intriguing as it is told literally in the shoes of the main character. You get wrapped up in the goings-on around you, invested in the characters and in what unfolds along the way.\n\nIt is a truly interesting experience that draws me back nightly for another chapter, and I cannot wait for future opportunities to experience more stories in VR from the perspective of the characters in them.\n\nHelpful | 6", "ryojin_sJun 25, 2019 at 6:34 PM\nWant to live in anime world?\n\nGreat mix of 360 anime world and multi-ending novel. You can be scared by a person from behind, stay up all night talking with a school girl, or change your last by choosing and kill someone. It's the first and best essential story in japanese VR history!\n\nHelpful | 6", "souldreamsJul 3, 2019 at 1:29 PM\nTwisted & sick ending\n\nEnjoyed it all the way up to the very end, and the ending is some sick stuff, very disappointing, turned it off and refused to finish it off, and no way of getting a refund.\n\nHelpful | 14", "wquJun 24, 2019 at 8:35 PM\nTAT\n\nHave guessed the ending half way through but I still cried my eyes out. Great story but really sad.\n\nHelpful | 6", "cedric.smets.7Jun 23, 2019 at 12:36 PM\n\nGreat story, great characters, great translations, great game!\n\nHelpful | 5", "yoshinari.yokoyamaJun 27, 2019 at 10:19 PM\nAwesome Japanese app\n\nI love it\n\nHelpful | 5"]
