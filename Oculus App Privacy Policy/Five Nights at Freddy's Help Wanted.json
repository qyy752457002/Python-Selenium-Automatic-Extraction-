The graphics are amazing for a quest game and gameplay is as scary as ever!

Its amazing, the claustrophobic feel, the terror of satanding so close to these horrific monsters, is what makes this game the most enjoyable on the quest, and I highly recommend it. Some of the features that make this game so awesome include:\n\n1. The life sized monsters make you feel in easy, and thats why its awesome\n\n2. There is a bit of comedy mixed in their, and it can always be a relief to the horror\n\n3.

Read this if you are having problems !\n\nHeres some tips if youre having problems\n\n\n( height ) :Ive seen people complain about their feet going through the floor and not being able to press buttons. But in this game, if you press the left joysticks up or down, that should change your height in game.\n\n\n( wobbling) :when you move your head in a fast pace and stop abruptly, the camera will wobble a bit.\nI suggest you move you head in a slow pace so its barely visible. Itll be removed soon so just be patient. ( I hope.....)\n\n\n\n( loss data ) :for this, you should always cloud sync every time you play and never to click launch app without syncing it. If the game closes and it says launch app its okay to click it because you were just playing the game and it wont lose any progress.\n\n\n\nTheres more problems but those are some of the more common.\n\nHelpful | 235", "nathan.salmon.5851Jul 19 at 8:41 AM\nAmazing but still has bugs\n\nI got this game as soon as it came out and I loved it. However, It still has a little bit of bugs still in it. For example, sometimes when I move my head, it kind of jiggles, and the visuals are great, but not perfect, and when I get the plushtrap jumpscare, it counts as a game over and I have to restart the whole night. Even though it still has some bugs, this game wasn't originally for quest, so I don't expect it to be perfect right of the bat, this game is still being worked on, so these issues should be resolved soon. Even with its few bugs, this game is still amazing and I recommend it.\n\nEdit: I looked into the plushtrap jumpscare one and it just looks like you fail but I was still able to pass to the next night\n\nHelpful | 267", "buttkiss10120 days ago\nFnaf scary\n\nI don't know what I was thinking\nLeaving my child behind\nNow I suffer the curse\nKnowing now I am blind\n\nWith all this anger, guilt and sadness\nComing to haunt me forever\nI can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river\n\nIs this revenge I am seeking\nOr seeking someone to avenge me\nStuck in my own paradox\nI wanna set myself free\n\nMaybe I should chase and find\nBefore they'll try to stop it\nIt won't be long before I'll become a puppet\n\nIt's been so long\nSince I last have seen my son\nLost to this monster\nTo the man behind the slaughter\n\nSince you've been gone\nI've been singing this stupid song\nSo I could ponder\nThe sanity of your mother\n\nI wish I lived in the present\nWith the gift of my past mistakes\nBut the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes\n\nYour sweet little eyes\nYour little smile, is all I remember\nThose fuzzy memories mess with my temper\n\nJustification is killing me\nBut killing isn't justified\nWhat happened to my son, I'm terrified\n\nIt lingers in my mind\nAnd the thought keeps on getting bigger\nI'm sorry my sweet baby\nI wish I've been there\n\nIt's been so long\nSince I last have seen my son\nLost to this monster\nTo the man behind the slaughter\n\nSince you've been gone\nI've been singing this stupid song\nSo I could ponder\nThe sanity of your mother\n\nHelpful | 67", "timeywimey221Jul 19 at 6:47 PM\nI'm am amazed\n\nI have played the Oculus rift version of the game all the way through twice and loved it. I was super excited to hear that the quest was getting a port so it would make jumping into the game so much easier! Let me tell you I am shocked at how good this game looks for the quest. There are a few areas that are questionable (fnaf 3 feels a bit too dark either that or I'm just blind) but overall the game looks great! I could only tell the difference with the animatronic models if I looked really closely. I played through all of the animatronic repair minigames and a night on each of the other ones and I gotta say this is a solid port! I'm very impressed with what steel wool was able to accomplish!

Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?\nUh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, \"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.\"\n\nBlah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.\n\nSo, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?\n\nUh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll p-most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.\n\nY-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.

Stays true to the original games and has great visuals.\n\nI am an old pro at five nights at freddys and I have pretty much become numb to the franchise. That being said, this game gives me shivers down my spine and I cant even complete the first night of Fnaf 1!! The title screen is freaky as all heck I mean Freddy, Bonnie, and Chica just stare at you and if you turn around BOOM theres foxy looking like he is going to end your career!\n\nThere is also the lore which I have been dodging for over a year in the anticipation of this game. I have no clue what business that bunny wants with me but I dont want to at the same time!\n\nI have no clue how I am going to get through the next few game modes or even the first night of Fnaf 1!

On some of the textures you can see edges on the pixels. Most levels dont have this but the larger ones like ennards vent repair have this problem. But the experience is the same either way and the graphics arent a huge issue. Sometimes the camera is unstable and when you look around everything shakes making it somewhat motion sickness inducing.\n\nMost things can go unnoticed if your not looking for it and the only big annoyance is the camera glitching around. Maybe you would want to wait to buy it but it is still a solid game in its current state and I for sure recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 85", "tonyb1023Jul 22 at 1:08 AM\nYou made a pretty poor career choice ;)\n\nWhen I started the game for the first time, my fight ot flight kicked in and said NOPE. The title screen alone gives you a sense of dread and caution that you aren't alone in this game.\n\nAs a huge FNAF fan, this is a love letter to the fans and horror fans alike. The tone, the atmosphere, the gameplay, and the scares are amazing. Every night feels like minutes turning to hours and adrenaline kicks in with the fear and hope of not getting jumpscared or caught.\n\nThis is a great game for those willing to take their first steps into the world of VR horror.

(I havent encountered any of them personally, but I know they are out there.)\n\nSecond, YES. THIS GAME IS SCARY. I hate seeing one star reviews because some 6 year old had bought it expecting it to be a Five Nights At Freddys SFM music video.\n\nIf you want a good scare, this game is perfect for you. If you dont expect it to be absolutely terrifying and give bad reviews because you are scared of it, you shouldnt play it.\n\nThirdly, if you are on the edge of buying it because you dont enjoy jumpscares, but want to try it, trust me. The scares will make you jump, but after playing for a few days, you tend to think of it as less scary, and more exhilarating. Its even more fun when you play with your friends. It overall adds to the experience and enjoyment.\n\nHelpful | 13", "sillydogeballJul 20 at 7:33 PM\nTotally unaware...\n\nThis was the biggest reason my son wanted in on the VR world. He has been following FNAF for a very long time and loves all the back stories, fan songs, theories, and fan fiction behind it. We purchased this immediately upon its release - the only game weve done that with on here! And how is it? Amazing! The graphics are crazy fantastic.\n\nSo whats with the title? Well, I was completely unaware of the appeal. My son enjoyed it previously on his other devices, but I had no interest. And now I completely see how it can be both fun and terrifying. I could hardly play through parts and service before closing my eyes and screeching - much to his rolling laughter, of course.\n\nWe are enjoying this so much, and were so, so impressed with the obvious work put into this game.

I would really like to have multiple things out, because you CAN play with plushies. Not to mention, its now impossible to get the Showtime trophy, because you have to remake it with the action figures. Same thing if you eat three figures and die, then you suddenly spawn into a level you were last in. Other then that, really good!\n\n\nAlso, heres some news for all you guys.

Includes more content than just Vr versions of the original games- new mini games, the prize counter, and an overarching story. If youre a fan of the franchise or horror games, get it.

The grapics are some of the best ive seen on quest. The gameplay makes me want to definitely play the game again and I know i will. I havent really noticed any bugs other than the lights on fnaf 2 occasionally not working for a sec. The small little scares they throw in really get me and the whole game is really scary and i can say ive bean dreading doing all the the levels aside from Parts and Service, Fnaf 2, Fnaf 1, and mangles vent repair which were still scary.

So when they announced it was coming to quest in October I was so happy even though I didn't have one at the time, and then when they announced it was coming July 16 I was jumping up and down and excitement! As soon as it turned 1 PM I downloaded it. I just beat it today and let me tell you it was AMAZING had really good graphics, really good jump scares, really good animations, and the only difference between this and the PC or PS VR version was the graphics, but otherwise it's a really good game it's worth your money especially $30 and it took me maybe over 7+ hours to beat it. I got all the endings but I haven't gotten all the all the prizes yet but I have gotten all the tapes and coins and it was a really fun experience and I can't wait for the DLC! I just have two small problems: first, I think fnaf 3 is too easy, and second some models mainly Ennard needs some updates, like sometimes when I see Ennard his chin and ears are pointed like triangles. But other than that this game is easily my favorite game on quest and possibly my favorite game of ALL TIME! also if you loved any of the flat screen versions of the games definitely check this out.\n\nHelpful | 11", "Sparx12456 days ago\nScary and hard\n\nThere is a huge difference for me with most of these levels.

Great game but make sure you are ready for the jump-scares.\n\nI would love to see them add hand-tracking and more mini-games in the future. This game has a lot of potential and I hope the game keeps being supported with more content.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the wobble, but it is barely noticeable. Idk why someone would rate the game 1 star because of it. In order to be annoying you would have to be moving your head at 500mph.\n\nEdit: I have another complaint. The finger tracking in the game right now is garbage. This can be quite frustrating especially in the animatronics repair mini game.

The first half will just be me explaining where I am with FNaF.\n\nIf you do have the time, please read it. If you dont, I pretty much wrapped up my thoughts in the final paragraph, although it would make more sense if you saw the rest. Just let me say this game is 100% worth it.\n\nI dont remember how I first found Scratch. As you probably would know, its a simple kids programming language for children to learn the concepts for real coding, and to share their creations. Despite it only being a starter language, I stuck with it for very long, until I was pretty much fluent.\n\nWhen it comes to fangames, FNAF has always been very allowing of it. This means many developers, or even younger children, are free to create a game inspired by it.\n\nScratch was a perfect example of this, (despite the new anti- horror game policy.) So many people made their own little FNaF clones.\n\nAnd I was one of them.\n\nWhen coding and playing other peoples games, however, I began learning a pattern in many projects. They always used similar animatronic AI, the same sound effects, tropes, and far too many uninspired jumpscares.\n\nSo due to this, I learned literally every thing about the original FNAF games, and became completely desensitised at a very young age.\n\nIt had gotten to the point where I knew every sound effect, song, mechanic, voice & trope and could recognise it immediately.\n\nSo its incredible how despite knowing literally everything about this series, story wise and gameplay wise,\nFNaF: Help Wanted still absolutely floors me. Everything just works. Its an absolute testament to the series and I am so glad I get to experience it.\n\nWell done Steel Wool!\n\nHelpful | 6", "Chicken_man156 days ago\nAmazing Game!\n\nIts terrifying to see robots almost 8 ft tall trying kill you, its perfect, fnaf 1 and fnaf 2 are exactly as you expect them to be, but fnaf 3 is darker then it normally is, everything else is fine. If your nervous or scared and don't want to get badly jumpscared, repairing the animatronics is the most tame, the least tame is night terrors, (duh)\nAlso, night 1 of fnaf 3 is to get you recognized with the layout and what to do, if you get it, good luck\n\nIf you're too short, press up on the right joystick to raise height, down lowers height, and if you move your head to fast, the camera will act weird\n\nFreddy Fazbear's Pizza\nWhere fantasy and fun come to life!\n\nHelpful | 2", "lemdavis213Jul 18 at 6:42 PM\nI hate it\n\nI hate this game so much.

Playing the game.\nIt is horrifying in every way. Just the first opening menu is terrific. Then you get into the game, and between the audio, the dark atmosphere, and of course the possesed animatronics out to get you, I had to take a 5 minute break after losing on night 4 because I was shaking so badly.

Another huge bug is how the Funtime Freddie night terror minigame seems to be COMPLETELY broken, as playing regularly I would get killed without even seeing Freddie in the first place, to counter this, I had to just stand at the door and not move for the entire 6 hours to complete the night. Aside from the glitches, I love that they added a withered mode to fnaf 2, as some of the withered animatronics are my favorites in the series, I really wish that they took away the weird red lighting from the withered mode, and just left it as normal so I can play the mode in its full glory. Another thing, although not a bug, is quite annoying, which is how you can only have one prize open at a time at the prize counter, I can understand there being a limit since it is a smaller game size, but only one!?!? I would like to have at least 3-5 at a time so I can look at all of the action figures, have all of the bobble heads at one time, etc. overall however, Id say this is the most fun game available on the oculus quest as of now as long as you can deal with a bit of horror. All of the game modes are unique in their own ways and offer unlimited amounts of fun and intriguing gameplay.if I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 I would definitely go with a 10 .\n\nHelpful | 5", "Dinosnake763 days ago\nGreat Game\n\nI love it! I have hated and always will hate horror/thriller games but FNAF is the one series that I dont hate. Its amazing. The amount of detail is insane. I love how FNAF 4 (the only non-vr FNAF game that has been able to make me scared, rather than just startled) is replaced with Night Terrors. I havent been able to complete Funtime Freddy and I know I will have nightmares about Nightmarionne, but I really just want to do the Circus Baby level. I feel like it would be better to make all 4 Night Terror levels available but you still need to complete all of them for Pizza Party. Though, thats just something I would want, personally.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Shuwei973 days ago\nA Great Game!\n\nLooks great for an oculus quest game and is the scariest game I have ever played!

The graphics are very well done and I havent had any problems with a jiggly affect. If you are into any horror or are just a fan of the FNAF franchise, dont miss this for anything. My favorite mode is the Parts and Service mode. You get to get up super close with Foxy, Freddy, Bonnie and Chika to Repair and fix them. Its really creepy but so cool. Great job With the port Steel Wool. However after all of this, I do have some big complaints. I think that the Night Terrors mode is just way too hard. I beat Night 5 on FNAF 1, 2, and 3, but cant even (as of right now) get past night one on Night Terrors. I have literally beaten everything else. Its SUPER hard. Also when I try closing the doors and closet in\nnight terrors, most of the time its super slow or doesnt register so that causes me to die a lot. PLEASE FIX THIS.

I especially liked the ones that were made for VR, such as the Parts and Service and Vent Repair. They really do give you the spooks. And there is a bit of humor thrown in there as\na break from the horror as the voice making funny remarks and the collectables being cute or funny.

It is one of the scariest experiences Ive ever had in my entire life. Five nights at Freddys is already scary, but now they are in your face and it really feels like youre there. Five stars for this!\n\nTwo problems\n\nThe only problems I have with this game is, one the floor when first load it in seems to be glitched out where it thinks the floor is higher than it is. My guess as to the reason for this is that most of the game is supposed to be played in a seat because if you go into your oculus menu and recenter while youre seated the floor is perfect and the desk is at the right height whereas if you recenter and then stand up everythings a little too low. So I suggest playing this game seated. The other problem I have is sometimes there is a surprise jump scare when you open a present at the end of the level. Its plush trap scaring you. In the PC version its just a jump scare and then its over, but for whatever reason and this version if he jump scares you you die and you have to replay the level as if you died in the regular part of the night/level. Im not sure if this is an accident or it is on purpose but it is very frustrating to beat a level and then be surprised with having to played over again.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nThe only other problems Ive noticed with the game is fnaf three seems to be a little glitchy in that sometimes spring trap seems to just teleport to your room with no warning and kill you or he can sometimes go past the vent locks, although I havent tested this to its full extent and I may just be missing something so I wouldnt write it down as a glitch.

So when you die, sometimes instead of the game room, you can be put into a room where there is an arcade cabinet and thats where you play the mini game. The room could be dark and the only light there will be is coming from the arcade cabinet. Idk but I think it could be a cool way to involve the little mini games and could possibly make the game even creepier than it already is.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Star_WarsBOYY13 days ago\nIts the best\n\nThis is the best game Ive played on my oculus so far, its not a waste of money but if you get scared of jump scares and a lot of flashing lights I wont suggest it but its worth the money!!\n\nHelpful | 0", "AnnieIsNotOKJul 22 at 2:08 PM\nAbsolutely amazing and scary!\n\nI played almost every night in fnaf Vr the minute I purchased it!

A few new game modes such as vent repair and tons of secrets to be found.\n\nOne glitch is when you look to your left or to your right, the screen will start shaking.

Personally, I think this game was amazing for many reasons, although I'll narrow it down to a few.\nI think this game has something for a lot of people. Whether it's searching for a challenge, a good scare or two, or both, this game delivers! The minigames are challenging and complex but are ultimately fun in the end. These minigames can test your patience and/or anger levels, since the game can sometimes reach blisteringly high difficulty in the later parts (it's called hard mode for a reason, but it's still VERY tough to get through). However, once you beat the minigames, you're rewarded with prizes, so, hey, I guess it's not so bad after all!\nIf you've been a fan of the series for a long time (like me since early 2015), this game feels like a dream come true and what I wanted the games to be like all those years ago. With faithful recreations of the first three installments, and remixes of the fourth and fifth games, and some new scenarios altogether, this game offers a trip down memory lane for any fan, even if they jumped off the series after 3. If you're a newcomer, this is a good place to start, as it's really the dawning of a new era for the Five Nights at Freddy's games. You'll be able to see what those scary games were all about up close and personal and learn snippets of the old lore and uncovering the mysteries behind the game itself with new lore (I'm not spoiling it because it's truly something you have to experience for yourself).\nI personally got my money's worth out of this, playing it nonstop for about 3 days before 100% completing it, and I have to say that, in my opinion, it's one of the greatest VR games of all time. I think it tests what a VR game can be, and creates fun and scary scenarios for you to play. There are a few bugs, but those'll get patched, I'm sure. Have fun with this game!\n\nHelpful | 1", "chinlee20106 days ago\nGreat game\n\nThis is a good game and it totally scares me which is suppose to be scary and that is great buy it and find all the vhs tapes to get a ending bye.\n\nHelpful | 0", "kasbJul 21 at 9:45 AM\nIt's amazing, but one thing\n\nI don't like that the floor is high, I assume it's supposed to be like that because maybe you're supposed to be a child playing this VR experience hinting at the entire storyline in general. it would be nice if you could turn this setting off, I understand if it's the default (if it's really supposed to make you feel like a child) but the ability to change it would be nice.\n\nHelpful | 0", "OmegeyTheBotJul 23 at 9:04 PM\nAwesome and worth the wait but...\n\nI love this game sooo much!

Its not something you can just beat in a day.\n\nThe only critique I have is in the lobby (prize counter and place where you select mini game) the screen is a little jumpy.

There are a couple of motion issues including button presses not registering and the floor level is a little odd. That said, I dont think Steel Wool couldve done any better than they have. They turned an extremely impressive game into a functional quest port. I believe the wait was worth it and the time spent waiting presents itself in the best (and almost uncompromising) port I couldve asked for.\nThe atmosphere is terrifying and the gameplay is just as good as you couldve asked in a VR FNaF game. As a fan of the games, the VR ports are as consistent as possible with an understandable lack of withered animatronics in FNaF 2. The mini games are also extremely satisfying in both controls and atmosphere, with night terrors being crowned most scary in my eyes.\nI am excited by the possibility of a Dreadbear port and/or security breach!

This is the only time i feel dizzy in VR ever. 3: my hands are having trouble touching things? Like registering touching or something, idk, like i have to press hard to get buttons going.

I never would of imagine that the thrilling games would come to VR.

I recently played and beat The Exorcist: Legion VR, and even that didnt come close to making me feel the terror that Help Wanted gave me. Everything in this game is not only balanced to be interesting and terrifying, but also fun and exciting. You wont get bored with this, I promise you.

I find it outstanding how it gets you scared with just the environment itself. The ambiance, the sheer height of the animatronics, and the good graphics just make it seem all to real.

It actually has very few bugs, many less than I was expecting. I hope this is the direction that other crap games will take with the quest. You know, instead of skipping them entirely, simply making their game more simplified so the quest can actually run it. The only somewhat major problem that Ive seen is the jiggling problem people are talking about. (Whenever you move your head stuff moves). But, it doesnt rly bother me, so whatever. Id definitely recommend this to any quest user, or horror lover in general. Overall 9.9/10\n\nEdit: I have found a pretty major glitch, its that even once you Bonnie left the room, and after I wore the mask the entire time toy Bonnie still jump scares me.

Graphics look amazing and I enjoyed! Would definitely recommend to any one (who is brave enough).\n\nA few things I have noticed that might need a bit of changing is:\n- The FNAF 3 office. Personally, I think it is too dark around the office. I also think that the glass in front of the office is too foggy and I can barely see through it.\n- One of the coins on the circus baby level is glitched. I can pick it up, but it doesnt disappear and have the particle and noise effects.\n- Sometimes there is this jiggly effect that makes it somewhat blurry. It doesnt bother me a little bit but most of the time I do not notice it.\n- A minor thing I noticed is that the hands are a little to big and doesnt really fit the size of the controller. I do not know if this is supposed to be but it still bugs me slightly.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Xris520Jul 19 at 9:37 PM\nSpooky\n\nThis is a great game overall, I would play hours on end if I could, but one small problem I ran into was the grabbing, a story I love to tell friends is that I was playing ennard vent repair and by the second level deep, I could not grab the last gear and started screaming and rambling, I dont know if it was a bug or the controllers themselves, so that will not make me lower my review, I am just trying to see if others had the same problem.\n\nHelpful | 1", "jaydogflo1987Jul 18 at 9:58 AM\nIts finally here and its amazing!\n\nThis is THE best VR game I have ever played so far, the bugs dont even mind me, but they are noticeable, such as the jiggle with the head movement, and some other tiny things, but this is only the first update, Im sure itll get better as more updates come, thanks steel wool for finally bringing this game to the quest!

Maybe friends and extended family after getting past COVID.\n\nWeve played it at our home casting to the tv. My daughters laugh and jump and scream themselves just watching it on the tv. Provides some good laughs.\n\nIve only had a few issues. 1) The height adjust. It is not smooth. Seems to jump around when adjusting and is difficult to set. 2) This port to Quest really should allow for full movement in environments. Being able to walk around using the thumb stick would make the game much scarier. Especially in levels like nights scares. 3) Grabbing doors and using the flash light in night scares does not have the greatest controls. The grip should be grip and the flash light button should not grab the door knob or release the door knob. When grabbing the door with your left hand the grip should not release unless you release the button. Right now it releases if you look away around the room because the hs loses tracking on the left hand. This should not cause you to let go of the door but it currently does causing Death many times.\n\nOther than the awkward control for night scares the game is fun for quick short gameplay and some good jump scares. It can get repetitive after awhile so I recommend shorter gameplay sessions and playing with a group that can enjoy it together.\n\nHelpful | 2", "CashTheRedBearJul 24 at 8:57 PM\nVery amazing game!\n\nThere is a lot I have to say about this game, it is the perfect mix of fun, and terror!

The quest port is very good, but there are still some small bugs and details that could use ironing out. Still a worthwhile buy, and if game improvements come in the future this will easily be a 5-star game.\n\nNow, the specifics. As far as the game itself goes, it's extremely good. It offers some fun spooks, with the VR aspect making the game really scarier than it should be. The game is extremely fun and replay-able as well. This is good, because a couple of the minigames in particular are extremely challenging. Most of the game is do-able, but there are some formidable challenges hiding in the catalog. So, the game is good, but what about the Quest port? Well, the quest port is pretty good, but could use some polishing. The camera shakes a tiny bit looking left and right, which is pretty disorienting. I can't imagine this being intentional, and it will hopefully be fixed soon. Most of the lighting and texture changes are fine, and don't change things so much that it's notable. There are some exceptions, but the shock value and quick movements of the animatronics usually mask the worse lower-res models. With a tiny bit more work, the game will be an essential in my books for both the fun factor and fun spooks it can offer. Until then, the quest port's few bugs do drag it down a good bit. If the camera shake has been fixed by the time you read this, then the game is pretty close to perfect, with some small imperfections.\n\nHelpful | 2", "kidnot3Jul 27 at 8:35 AM\nits perfect\n\nthis game is a great summary of fnaf\n\nHelpful | 2", "Theamazinggamer26Jul 20 at 6:20 PM\nThis is a great game\n\nThis is not only the scariest game on quest but one of the best looking games on quest as well!

Although this doesnt seem that game breaking I still think its a little weird.\n\nHelpful | 0", "sourXskittlez16 days ago\nyeah yeah\n\nvery good game but too scary for me\nkeep up the good work bro\n\nHelpful | 0", "HAIRYUNICORNSJul 18 at 8:10 AM\nAmazing game\n\nGraphics are a bit wonky and game has a jiggly effect sometimes, but Ive been waiting for this game to be released and its amazing, 5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Jake_GJul 17 at 5:50 PM\nGraphics are Amazing\n\nI dont like scary movies or games but I wanted to try Fnaf.

Although the 4th one is Night Terrors and only has one animatronic instead of 3. Parts and service is cool, 1, 2, 3. Are all good, although I feel like the randomization of video, audio,ventilation are really bad. Within one minute of starting night 3. Ventilation had broken 3 times and by a minute and a half I was dead. This happened like 3 times in a row. But hey, most likely my luck. But holy jesus, the most boring thing in the world. Is by far the one where you sit in the room and just shine your flashlight every four seconds. I dont even remember because I hate it so much. Its so tedious and boring, its unbelievable. You can tell by the way the rest of them are made that they are purely filler. They had a good idea putting plush trap and BB in. But the rest are terrible. And plushtraps mini game shoulda been put in a bonus category or something. The plushbaby one is by far the worst one out of all of them. It was so frustrating playing that one. It wasn't even scary. Especially since there are sound cues when you are going to die. So you hear that and you're dead. Even if there weren't sound cues. After like 3 times of dying. They wouldn't be scary. For real tho, how this man about to die to a plushie doll? Really a cool take on the FNAF series but dear god.

My biggest pet peeve, however, is the jumpscares. They arent scary. The animatronics are oversized in jumpscares, which is cool, but takes away from the immersive experience.

Im definitely going to change my rating when the bugs are fixed but these not to be brought to your attention. The biggest thing is when I move around in my play space the entire game shakes and wobbles and it causes extreme discomfort for people that Im trying to show. That seemed to be the only bug I saw so far but there needs to be a better way to adjust your height. Sure you can push on the joystick but there are only like 4 options and none of them fit my height. There needs to be more in the options menu other than subtitles ex: Height adjustment, brightness, accessibility for color blind, etc. I also dont like that you cant make a pointer finger or thumbs up. I strongly suggest you talk to oculus about adding hand tracking because this would be the perfect game for it. Just pressing buttons and in some modes teleporting. The only problem I can see it the speed at witch your hands move at, the quest might not be able to keep up. I will be changing my rating after the height and shakiness are fixed.

I write this while trying to get my breath back from all the times those animatronic toys scared the living daylights out of me. \n\nFive nights at Freddys in VR on the oculus quest is just simply incredible and definitely lives up to the hype which has been surrounding it for over a year now! For anyone whos played the mobile games youll know and can probably envisage exactly how immersive and ramped up this is or would be in VR!\n\nThe game contains the three original mobile games all tweaked in the right areas to adapt to virtual reality platforms. For instance when you take the first, original five nights at Freddys for example you can actually see the animatronic toys moving around on camera, particularly when they get near the security doors youre guarding. If they approach the doors theyll stop in their tracks and you can actually see them attempt to take an oportunity to attack. \n\nAs well as including all three original mobile games revamped for VR theres also additional modes which have been exclusively created for this VR version, most Im still yet to try but theres a night terror mode, vent repair mode where you have to repair the vents while fighting off any opportunities the toys get of scaring you, parts and service where I believe you have to repair the toys as carefully as possible. Any false moves and a jump scare can occur which makes it extremely nerve racking and challenging at the same time!\n\nIve always appreciated the concept of a game like this which requires you to stay focussed, organised and balanced with what you need to do while trying extremely hard to maintain composure!\n\nIts so excellently executed in VR, scares you to death and to boot it has an absolute ton of content and different games modes with probably even more to discover than Ive written here!\n\nIt already has hundreds of reviews on the store already and understandably so given the fact the franchise has been massively popular on mobile platforms for many years now.

Also, when its supposed to make the Jumpscare sound on one side, and click the opposite light switch first, it makes the sound then changing the light to the other side.

When you turn, its on the left joystick which is different than like every very game, and, when you actually do turn, it resets your height incorrectly to the point that you just dont want to play anymore.

Ill start by saying that, unlike the previews games of the franchise, I really think that this game can be enjoyed even for peoples who think that Five Nights At Freddys is not scary because of its poorly animated jump scares. Even tho, this game on quest has lower graphics, I had a much better experience by playing this game, as I could free roaming around my area and not be limited by the way of psvr that blocks u without even the ability of moving. I also have to point out that the graphic is not that bad as much people would expect: the game is so well made (AI, ambience, sounds, and terrify g characters) that you dont even notice the difference, unless youre just playing it with quest just to criticize the graphics. I honestly think that people should start playing fnaf vr hep wanted from quest, and then move to the psvr, rift....

I am sadly almost halfway done with it already, but from a 14 year old who has beaten every FNAF game, this is still an entire new experience.

It also makes it impossible to play while sitting because you are looking up at the bottom of the floor if that makes sence\n- Fun time Freddy's jumpscare looks 2d\n- models and textures look like 2003 video game graphics\n- After about 2 hours, I felt to feel sick however because of this strange effect in the game. Its hard to explain.\n\nAll in all, the Cons are definitely not a deal breaker if you are trying to see if this game is worth your money. Just some minor things im sure steel wool will fix in the future.\n\nI think this is one of my best buys. I love this game so much that I was considering getting an Oculus Rift S instead of the quest, just because it had FNAF VR but I waited and bought a quest hoping this game would port onto the quest, and it did. I am a HUGE fan of FNAF and literally get up out of bed everyday and do something related to FNAF.

A good quest port, has only one real bug that might not even be a bug. The movement feels clunky, but it makes it feel more like a fever dream and adds to the creepiness.

The jumpscares have no diversity and the quality of the graphics is somewhat poor. I was hoping Springtrap would pull out all the stops in terms of jumpscaring players like he did for the pc version of FNAF 3, but he jumpscared me a couple times and there was no difference between said jumpscares.\n\nIf it werent for the non-diverse, poor quality jumpscares, I'd give this game a 10/10, but instead I give it a 9/10.

In my opinion graphics dont matter too much as long as its a good and fun game which it is. The only thing Ill complain about is how the game makes you shorter, when I first got the game when it came out I was almost eye level to the animatronics, now (guessing with the update) made me shorter and no matter how much I calibrate to make myself taller Im still short.\n\nHelpful | 0", "CHOCOLATECATZJul 18 at 10:22 AM\nVery good but insanely scary!\n\nI love this game so much!

However, one thing that breaks immersion is when i turn my head in any direction, the view shakes and can give me slight motion sickness, but I'm sure it can be fixed in a future patch.

The atmosphere is top notch with unsettling rooms and horrifying dynamic sounds to make you go into a panic when you believe one of the animatronics are near. Scott loves to put his humor in his games and this one is no different teasing the player throughout the game that everything is normal. For FNAF fans the lore is still Intact and tells a new story.

So dont let a slight downgrade of graphics prevent you from buying it. Second i would like to address the fact that this game will make you piss yourself. Do not let a kid 10 or under play the game unless they can %100 handle it. I have played one of other horrifying games The Excorcist Legion Vr for the quest. This in my opinion beats the crap out of that game. Fnaf HW is so much scarier. Third, Yes there are bugs in the game. So far i have only found 2 but i will edit if i find more and if any get fixed. Here are the bugs.\n\n1. Head movement is a little wobbly and jiggly when you turn. This will cause people with motion sickness so become very sick and possibly throw up.\n\n2. In the Parts and Service, Chica is very difficult. This is due to the fact of the cupcake being very hard to grab. My first time playing i had my hand on the cupcake like 3 or 4 times, i did the grab controls and it wouldnt pick up.\n\nBut still these bugs should not stop you from picking up this gem of a game.

Sometimes youll get a plushtrap jumpscare as a prize at the end of a night. Based on what Ive seen, its supposed to scare you and then go away, then you go onto the next level.

It really does give you an uneasy feeling that anything could get to you at anytime.\n\nAs a quest port, this game has really put in the work to exceed other ports on the quest. Of course there are some very minor issues with lighting as anything that would normally glow or seem shiny would probably put the quest at work or even lag a bit, but that is only a very minor issue as this is a standalone system. If anything gets me the most, it's that everything seems dark and shaded more than the PC and that actually gets me more scared so kudos to Steel Wool on that.\n\nThe game is literally a masterpiece on the quest. Not having to worry about a cable if you fall on your back from being jump scared (as I have) is something that puts you at an absolute sense of freedom and immersion. This game is literally the same on PC, expect it's on the quest with lower graphics and wireless freedom. Actually, I might play the Quest port more often than PC unless I really am in it for the graphics. Depends on the mood. But for any of you worrying if this is worse than PC, dont. Get this game. I may have gotten it for free since I already own the PC version, but I would have still played $30. 10/10. Recommended as one of my fav VR games. ;)\n\nHelpful | 0", "Gethan_ErmanJul 17 at 12:08 AM\nExactly what I hoped for\n\nThis game is amazing even tho im to afraid to play any of the original 3 past the first night, for a quest port it looks so much better than I couldve hoped for and watching my family members play this is so funny because they think its not gonna be scary then they wanna get off right when they start a game.

The mini games are all incredibly fun and heart-pounding, and everything looks amazing in VR. Its so terrifying in the FNAF 2 mode when you turn on the middle light and its like youre actually looking down a hallway. I also love how there is a huge variety of mini games, but you have to beat the previous ones to get to them (im still too terrified to even try funtime freddy and plushtrap, LOL) This game strikes the perfect balance between horror and gameplay, and I highly recommend it for anyone, even non-fnaf fans. If I had to say one negative thing, its that I constantly need to readjust the height, as everytime I enter a new menu/minigame it gets reset. This game was absolutely worth the wait and DEFINITELY worth 30$. I cant wait for the Dreadbear DLC!!\n\nHelpful | 1", "I_Casket_IJul 16 at 4:19 PM\nAbsolutely fantastic!\n\nBeen waiting for this since the PCVR version released last year. The DLC content isnt out yet (as of writing this, that is) so theres still that to look forward to!

The game is a blast and I highly recommend it! This game makes every other FNAF game a cakewalk when it comes to being scared, this game is the most terrifying game I have ever played and to add to that it has a ton of game modes so you can switch up the experience.\n\n\n\n\nMy only criticism is that the camera is a little wobbly when you look around which can cause slight motion sickness but Im sure this will be fixed in a patch in the future. However this is not a dealbreaker cause eventually you get used to the camera and the game is still loads of fun so I reccomend it!\n\nHelpful | 1", "SolarxDJul 17 at 11:15 AM\nYES but...\n\nIt is definitely still a five star and 100% worth your money. I had this game in the oculus rift and it was awesome. I was waiting to play it wireless and I finally can! The only down side is the slight slight head wobble when you turn which if you get motion sickness easily it could be a little bit disorienting. Other than that great quest port steel wool. The head wobble is the only fix this game needs.\n\nHelpful | 1", "CosmiccosmoJul 16 at 5:42 PM\nYES!!\n\nI have waited so long for this game to come to Oculus Quest, and it is the exact same game you get on PSVR and on PC.

For me, that isnt the case. You could say Im around half way through the game right now and it has blew my expectations away. The graphics look stunning and honestly blew me away. They might be better or on par with the switch graphics. Personally, I thought that after looking at the switch graphics, they would be considerably worse and that worried me but that is not the case. The game has run mostly butter-smooth with only a little stutter at some points and I have not encountered any bugs so far. As for the jumpscares, I went into it expecting not to get scared but oh god the jumpscares are beautiful. 5 Stars!\n\nHelpful | 0", "RRgamerJul 17 at 12:17 AM\nGreat game, Better scares\n\nI have this game on pc for the oculus link, I really enjoyed it and I think its a great game. When it comes to the year I think it has definitely gone down in quality a lot, but this obviously makes sense. The biggest problem is that the camera kinda jitters and doesnt follow you perfectly. This definitely makes the game less... easy to play? I dont know how to say it. Overall the game is awesome highly recommend.

The game was ported over perfectly, and my only complaint is that the first time I launched it it was really glitchy, but then I quit and launched it again and it worked much better. I dont want to spoil much, but if you like scary games, or if you enjoyed the original indie games that sparked this whole Five Nights at Freddys saga, then you should definitely check this out.

It is challenging and so scary one of my friends who is 15 will not play it. If you do scare easily then make sure you have a large playspace as I have broke a monitor while hitting a door button.

This game is a 10/10 vr title and if youre looking for a fun game to play with family and friends, this is it! At times this game can be difficult but youll probably end up playing a different level. Very addictive! This is the best (in my opinion) FNaF game in the series! Also, this game adds a whole new layer of lore to the already giant book of lore. Now, if you havent played any of the previous games, you probably wouldnt get it, so I suggest watching Game Theory or a time line video. Now the graphics. The graphics are definitely downgraded and a couple of the areas in the game are different from the pc vr and psvr version but thats fine. Watching a video does not give this game justice. And trust me, this game is pretty scary, but you probably wont scream at the top of youre lungs. Ok, thanks for reading this! P.S. if youre reading reviews to see if you should get the game, get it, its totally worth it, plus the dlc will probably come out on Halloween!\n\nHelpful | 0", "CrazyFoxy105Jul 16 at 12:45 PM\nWorth every cent\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing.

Just WOW!\n\nI have been waiting for this game for so long now. I remember playing back when it first came out on the PS4. Comparing then to now, it looks way more real and it feels like you are fully there and immersed within the world of FNAF. The audio is impecable. The queues for such are absolutely amazing. The lighting and mood of the entire game is appropriate and, to me, the dark parts feel A LOT darker than in the previous versions. I love it for the sole fact of, when it's dark, you don't know what's coming or if something is going to happen. Plus when you get into the darker levels, it gets easier to disorientate yourself. And that's fantastic. Especially in a game where one wrong slip-up means death and fear. All in all I love the game and how far it's come!\n\nUpdate! With the newer version there is bound to be some bugs. I find FNAF 2 to be absolutely un-faz-bearable to play. This is because the mask, when in your hand, likes to jump onto your face at random. Otherwise, everything works as intended.\n\nHelpful | 1", "B0nnJul 16 at 4:17 PM\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n\nHeyo people! If you are reading this, BUY THE GAME! It was the best 30$ Ive ever spent!

The advancement from the original games is jaw dropping! Although the graphics arent as stunning as its Rift counterpart (even though they still look amazing), YOU WILL BE PARANOID OF EVERYTHING HAPPENING!

One is on the Freddy parts and service level, when i try to replace the voice thing it jump scares me every time even though Im doing nothing wrong. Its probably something Im doing but I cant figure it out for the life of me. Also, when you turn your head there is a weird bobbing that is somewhat disorienting but considering this is a new port I assume it will be fixed in the future so I can look past it.

A game that doesnt want me to pick up and grab my headset is a good game. Not many horror experiences get me like his game does. Good job developers!\n\nHowever please fix the 6am issue!\nI dont know if this has happened to everyone else but during the 6am chime, many animatronics still get you. The jump scare itself is fine but the issue is if you die on the 6am screen you sometimes lose the progress you gained that night. So on a really hard night, to get jumpscared by Toy Freddy when its 6am is frustrating and annoying. If its going to happen, I dont feel like its worth replaying that night just to lose that progress again despite reaching 6am.\n\nAlthough once its fixed, then it will be an incredible game. So for those who hate losing progress be very careful.\n\nHelpful | 0", "cyphereyes1Jul 17 at 7:02 AM\nLove the game-fix the bouncing!\n\nI bought the Quest specifically after I heard they were planning to port this in future. Was not disappointed, this is my favorite game on Quest so far. The only reason I can't give it a perfect score is the bounce everyone mentions when looking left to right. I do get a little motion sickness, but the randomness of the bouncing gets me sick much faster then most games. Love it with this problem though.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Curpin21Jul 17 at 7:46 PM\nGreat But a Little Buggy\n\nSo far Ive only played the game a little bit, but the little bit Ive played have looked great and felt great. But I also had experienced a couple of bugs. The first thing I had noticed was that I had a little bit of wobble to my view when I looked around. The second thing I noticed was that I was closer to the ground and about a foot and a half shorter than I should be. But other than those I havent experienced any other bugs and the little bit Ive played so far have been exhilarating.\n\nHelpful | 0", "AidensACutieJul 17 at 11:02 AM\nIts an easy buy\n\nI love this game so much, ive been waiting so long for this. I know porting this game wasnt easy and Covid-19 came along, but I think the wait was worth it. I wouldve rather them keep working on the game (like they did) instead of just pushing it out with bugs and glitches. This game, in my eyes, has infinite replay value and Im so excited for the DLC coming later down the line. The price tag might seem high but its worth it, if youre on the fence about this game I can safely say its worth it. Many of my friends arent even into horror games but love to play this one, they did a great job making tense moments for the player while also adding hints of comedy which makes the game so enjoyable. I have to say this is an amazing game, there are bugs but im sure theyll be fixed soon. I had to give it 4 starts just because the bugs can be annoying but its basically the same game from any other platform, just on the quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "TheNaked_GamerJul 17 at 3:39 PM\nI screamed like a girl\n\nI got this game and was so excited. Surprisingly the graphics and the animatronics look just as great on the quest. I got scared while playing it and when playing the vent repair with mangle I screamed like a girl when she was in my face. My only problem while playing was that when I wasnt really moving everything was kind of shaky. But all in all everything else worked fine. Id highly recommended you get this when you can.\n\nHelpful | 1", "An_Ordinary_GuyJul 17 at 1:36 PM\nF@*#ing terrifying!\n\nOk, I hate horror in general. Hate scary games, scary movies, scary books. But this game has me coming back for more each time I play! Its really fun in a I dont wanna play this anymore type of way. I would have this at 5 stars except for the fact that the movement is kind of weird. It shakes every time I move and the controllers tend to glitch into an object for no reason. Fix that and this review becomes a 5\n\nHelpful | 0", "ashe7Jul 17 at 6:45 AM\nHorrifyingly Awesome\n\nAs a huge fan of all the FNaF games, I thought I would be able to enjoy this game without being scared (I was wrong). This is my first horror experience in VR and I can say that if youre looking for a good scare, this game is the way to go. The puzzles and challenges also make for some really fun gameplay as well as scary gameplay. The only negative thing Ive experienced is that the screen shakes a little when you move your head, and I felt nauseous when I opened the game, not too much of an issue though, still worth it to get this game on the quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "imabanana8Jul 17 at 5:40 PM\nbest vr game I ever played\n\nwow.

The issues however, can't be overlooked. There's a weird stutter on the main hub, which causes motion sickness in ten minutes, your player height is set to the floor, and it isn't explained how to raise it, and the game had a problem with random crashes on first launch. The gameplay itself is incredibly fun, being able to look and walk around the offices from the first three main games+ some mini games is a neat experience, and the characters are all animated, which adds to the experience. The game is incredibly fun, but I just can't overlook the problems that drag down the overall gameplay. Would recommend, 8/10\n\nHelpful | 0", "Ev1738Jul 16 at 1:12 PM\nPretty good, but\n\nA solid port of what I've played so far.
