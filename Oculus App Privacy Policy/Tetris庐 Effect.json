Ive never been a big fan of the game or played it much growing up.\n\nI took a chance after reading some reviews and bought this game, and I am blown away! I love the music, the visuals, and everything about it. Its incredibly fun to play and the music is really good! I dont like every song, but theres like 25 to choose from, and different difficulty settings. Im actually getting pretty good at the game after a week of playing.\n\nIf youre on the fence, like the music (Hydelic on Spotify) and want to have a great game experience... Try this game out! Worth the price.\n\nHelpful | 19", "PilotFawn10 days ago\nSo much more than Tetris\n\nMy hubby has had a vive and a quest for some time & having tried it I suffer awful vertigo & was limited to just one game.\n\nLoved Tetris years ago but when he downloaded Tetris effect I fell in love with it. Its more than just a Tetris game, it is a beautiful experience.\n\nThe light shows and music is awesome to the point I often play the soundtrack outside VR but it also spurred me to buy my very own Quest because finally I have a game for me!\n\nI love journey mode but great to just dip in for the effects mode & take part in the weekly ritual.\n\nThis is way more than Tetris & the perfect way to wind down after a tough day. Seriously give it a try!\n\nHelpful | 7", "pgf7383Jul 12 at 4:40 AM\nTetris..just not as we know it\n\nI was a bit sceptical before buying this as I thought its just Tetris right? But I was wrong.\nThis is Tetris but also something more. Its ethereal, psychedelic, otherworldly and emotional. The music, the sound effects and the imagery enhance each level in ways that make each block placement all the more fun. Once the music really kicks in and you start building up a rhythm, it gets very very good. I love this game. Its the perfect way of using VR to enhance a classic game.\n\nHelpful | 10", "thegoldengooberMay 14 at 2:37 PM\nMore than just Tetris\n\nAs a very seasoned VR player, this is the first VR game that has brought me to tears. The gameplay is just Tetris, yes, but the way the game ties the sound effects of to the music, as well as the dynamic and beautiful environments, makes for a profoundly touching experience you just have to play to understand. 5 out of 5, 10 out of 10, the team behind this deserve an award.\n\nHelpful | 509", "gfxblit15 days ago\nOne of the best VR experiences!\n\nJust finished on normal mode and what an amazing experience! Intellectually challenging, 360 visuals that synergizes with the game, amazing sound effects and music -- all combine to create a truly immersive experience. Very zen-like, with ties to the planet. This should be the token app to share with friends (that don't want to play the-next-FPS-shooter-military-sim).\n\nHelpful | 2", "Elwinbu19 days ago\nBest single player Tetris experience\n\nAs title says. This is the best Tetris game I've played, but do take note there is no multiplayer mode as of now (should be added next year).\n\nVR adds to the immersion and experience, coupled with an excellent soundtrack that synergizes with the gameplay and controllers vibration. But at its core you are still looking at a modern tetris take, although extremely refined.\n\nHighly recommended even if you like Tetris by just a tiny bit.\n\nHelpful | 2", "McFluffyKitten21 days ago\nGreat, Even If You're Bad At Tetris\n\nI bought this game on a whim and looking for something new to play and I was not disappointed in Tetris Effect.\nI find myself fully immersed in the blocky puzzles with the music and sounds reflecting my current gameplay.\nYou're not just playing Tetris here, this is a whole experience and one worth your time, even if you're terrible at tetris like I am.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Dawntree8 days ago\nBeyond Tetris, it's a new experience\n\nLike many I was so curious why everyone loved it and in a boring evening I bought it. OH. MY. GOD. It's like living in another dimension traveling through space and time. The visuals, the music, the sound effects...\nThe gameplay is the classic Tetris (mostly) but the experience you live is just mystic. I always play until I ran out of battery on my Quest.\n\nMany suggest to use a gamepad, but since I don't own a BT one I had to use the Touch controllers and tbh I've found them extremely comfortable (since I can sit with my arms open and not reaching for the gamepad) and precise enough.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Citadel17May 14 at 10:48 PM\nThis is, without a doubt, a masterpiece.\n\nTetris games aren't meant to be considered high art.\n\nTetris games aren't meant to make you lose your sense of place.\n\nTetris games aren't meant to make you feel at one with humanity and the universe.\n\nAnd Tetris games especially aren't meant to make you tear up.\n\nBut here's Tetris Effect, a Tetris game that fits all of these categories.\n\nThis is a work of art, and I encourage anybody to get it. You know how to play it. It's Tetris. But it's Tetris that will make you lost in the gameplay and cause you to feel at peace within the world. Absolute 10/10, please experience this.\n\nHelpful | 86", "AzulRoyalJul 3 at 6:59 AM\nTetris. AMPLIFIED.\n\nTo call this just simple Tetris is a frickin' understatement. Oh it's definitely still Tetris, but with all the intricate worlds literally coming to life around you as you play it's very much a mega glorified version of it. The visuals are amazingly pretty and the music is riveting. Literally every move you make, the turning of your blocks and crashing them down, builds upon the music and sound effects literally becomes the music. You essentially use your moves to get the music going. It's very easy to get swept away in it all. It's therapeutic, hypnotic, just EPIC. Very, VERY pleased with this purchase.\n\nNote: There's lots of light effects in this game, so it may not be suitable for certain folks out there.\n\nHelpful | 6", "SubjectDelta11Jul 17 at 1:00 PM\nAmazing experience\n\n after putting at least 150 hours into the oculus quest experience in many different games I must say this game was absolutely amazing I would recommend it to anyone that has purchased a VR headset in general and has made my VR experience just that much better.\n\nThis game has such a weird way of making you feel like youre really in the experience and the audio and visual effects are absolutely top-notch and all of the different game modes as well as the newly implemented zone feature makes me strive to get extremely high score.\n\nIf you like the Vr if you like Tetris get this game now\n\nEven if you dont like Tetris this game will make you want to play Tetris\n\nHelpful | 3", "aaron.sommers.1253May 14 at 10:39 AM\nTetris Effect\n\nOh wow, was not expecting this today. Smiles all day long, I just LOVE  this app. If you like Tetris, you will love this, its Tetris on high. It also gives a great sense of connection, I just love it \n\nHelpful | 234", "ChillahGorillaJul 20 at 8:22 AM\nSurprising\n\nI'm usually not a big fan of puzzle games, so it took me a while to try this. Tetris would be pretty low on my list of \"things to play in VR\", but there were so many positive reviews that I had to try it. Honestly, I was planning to get it just to see what everybody liked about it and then get a refund.\nI never did get that refund. I'm going to assume everyone is familiar with the gameplay of Tetris, so I'm just going to mention what sets this version apart. The music and visuals are beautiful and I cannot overstate how much they add to the game. How they integrate everything together makes the game feel fresh and immersive and each stage feel unique. This game was designed to be played in VR with good headphones, it really is amazing what they were able to do with a simple concept.\nI was caught completely off guard by how much I like this game, I now think it is completely worth getting and worth the price.

Inevitably the Quest can't throw as many particles around.\nSome objects on levels which looked sharp and rendered from many tiny dots on the PC instead look like meshes with low res, blurry \"dot textures\" on the Quest.\nI don't think every drop of performance was painstakingly squeezed out of the Quest like it was with Superhot or Space Pirate Trainer.\n\nVerdict:\nFor a title that is very much about it's visual effects and music, the music survives and surprisingly sounds stunning on the Quest but the visual effects are inevitably turned down from 11 to 7 vs PS4/PC.\nThe visual fidelity retained is just enough to warrant the title Tetris Effect on Quest without the need for an \"Unplugged\" subtitle. Any more compromise and it would be TE:Light.\n\nIf you've never played the original on PC/PSVR it's an absolute must as you won't notice any of the above compromise.\n\nAnd, I'd buy it anyway as it's a brave effort at a portable version of the classic!\n\nHelpful | 119", "Winter.Wolf21A day ago\nDidnt expect to enjoy this...\n\nIf youre thinking, should I really spend money on Tetris? I was like you. I was definitely happy with the way the game was done. The Tetris board is about 10 feet in front of you  but the music, sounds and the environment around you is what really made this a fun VR experience. As you play you can play through various environments that have colors, animations and sounds that evolve as you progress. Would give it a 5 if there were more experiences available but a great game to have as most VR games are a play through once type this is something you can always go back to. Worth full price for sure but if its ever on sale you would be losing out on not getting it.\n\nHelpful | 1", "kennyM4h4May 18 at 7:09 AM\nBelieve the hype...\n\nWhen this came out on other VR platforms a year or so ago, I couldnt understand why there was any need to play Tetris in VR, or why it should be so expensive for a 35 year game which you can effectively play for free on your phone. When it came out on Quest and the 5 star reviews kept rolling in I decided to bite the bullet and see what all the fuss was about.\n\nNow I get it! Firstly, it just works in VR - even back when I played on by gameboy years ago, you only really played well when you got into a sort of flow state where you immersed into the game, playing VR enhances your ability to do that as you are entirely encompassed by the experience.\n\nNext the quality and scale of the different levels, you can totally see how much effort and though has gone into the game, and there for how the cost is justified. From amazing backgrounds that develop as you work through the level to beautiful sound tracks that somehow are able to incorporate your tile movements in harmony with the music, it all feels to polished and immersive.\n\nOne piece of advise I would give, Tetris purists may prefer using the A and B buttons to rotate the pieces, but I found it much more intuitive once I swapped out the buttons (which Im pleased to say are completely configurable) so that the left and right triggers turned the pieces anti-clockwise and clockwise respectively. Down to individual preference but it helped me a lot.\n\nAs other reviews have said, it needs to be played to fully appreciate it, also, make sure you stick at it, if like me you will probably be terrible at first till you get back into the mechanics of it all again, dont be afraid to swap out pieces regularly, and happy gaming!\n\nHelpful | 31", "Banja78Jun 17 at 10:14 AM\nTrippy\n\nThis is probably one of the best gaming experience ever.\n\nI will not do a detail review. I just want to mention that if you like to play Tetris and if you like the previous work of developers (especially Rez) then you are very lucky, no hesitation, just go get it. The price seems high to play Tetris but it definitely worth it.\n\nThis is a game that you play with headset after turning your phone off, closing the door and telling your family you do not want to be disturbed for one hour. After the hour you wake up as a new person, washed from the inside.\n\nOf course if you feel Tetris is not your kind of game because all you like in video game is shooting, then please walk away.\n\nHelpful | 7", "UBSERDJul 26 at 1:25 PM\nGreat Tetris game from a great creator.\n\nIf you were to add one thing to Tetris and make it perfect it would be the interactive musicial direction of Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

If youve ever played Luminez or Child of Eden and love them, you cant go wrong here. Be warned this is not an easy Tetris game, but if you like a good challenge its a definite buy.

Welcome to Tetris Effect, an experience that cannot be explained only experienced.\n\nBeautiful images, beautiful music and hypnotic gameplay take you through a medative journey that's indescribable. I actually use this as part of my mindfulness routine, playing in the evening before bed and whenever I feel a bit anxious. It's both calming, stimulating and elative.\n\nI played this on the PSVR first, and while yes, the quest version is slightly less particle-y than the PS4 version as others have mentioned, it doesn't take away from the overall experience and feelings, it's exactly the same experience, if you haven't played it before you won't know and you won't be missing out on anything.

There are some pretty graphics and some decent musical effects but ultimately it's a 2D board and a regular Tetris game.\n\nIt's fun, it is definitely immersive but it's not worth 23: especially as even in beginner mode the learning curve is stupid - after several sedate levels you'll reach \"Celebration\" which goes from level 1 to 6 to 9 very quickly and then ultimately requires luck to complete. Subsequent levels are just as badly designed, and I expect will be fixed in a later patch.\n\nHelpful | 1", "pineappo9 days ago\nBeautiful, but lack customizations\n\nThis is a new spin on tetris .

I would've love to see more customization options with piece delays (e.g., DAS, ARR, line clear customization) and more pieces in preview.\n\nI would also love to see multi-player in a sequel from the makers.

JUST SEARCH GAMERTAG VR\n\nI remember playing Tetris back on the gameboy. Loved the music, the progression and the simplicity at the beginning that soon becomes quite the addiction to get further with each play. I personally dont know anyone who is gamer and hasnt had a small love affair with Tetris at some point.\n\nSo here we are in 2020 with Tetris Effect for the oculus quest and let tell you, this version of tetris in Virtual Reality is the ULTIMATE way to experience this game.\n\nBeautiful visuals, fantastic music and every single level is individual in taste and presentation. Its feels like your on a journey which can be inspiring but also make you feel like your in a meditative state.\n\nThe Tetris effect is when you play so much that you see tetris blocks as mental images, and in your dreams. Now I know that may sound far fetched and personally I havent experienced that level but I have reached a mental state of autopilot. Your playing the game which now feels like an extension of yourself. Your there not on the outside but on INside of the game. You can see blocks fitting that you couldnt before and I can only put this as a feeling of meditation.\n\nRegardless of all that magical stuff the game is sublime with very memorable music and me and my wife love playing it on PSVR and but even now more so on the quest due to take anywhere magic of quest\n\nThanks for reading and remember you have the oculus 2 hour refund policy. If your on the fence, please I really recommend this 1 game you should make use of it\n\nHelpful | 25", "thechrisstreet10 days ago\nBeautiful. Elegant. Refined. Yet...\n\nI'd spent numerous days during lockdown debating on whether or not to buy an Oculus Quest. I kept weighing up the pros and cons, wanting to justify its purchase.\n\nThen, Tetris Effect was announced - a game I had already experienced and loved, for the Playstation 4. Suddenly I found myself buying the Quest and downloading the game.\n\nComparisons to the PS4 version are inevitable. The Quest is vastly underpowered compared to home consoles, and I was expecting a massive drop in visual fidelity. After all, I had read numerous reviews beforehand stating that there were fewer special effects, but it was still worth a purchase.\n\nLet me just say right now, I do like Tetris Effect a lot. But I don't love it like I do on PS4. That sense of... immersion... isn't quite there for me, even with headphones. I never felt like I was \"in the zone\" as I was on PS4 and I kept on thinking I'd rather be playing that instead.\n\nAnd yet, I keep coming back for more. It's a beautiful game, fantastically put together, held back by lengthy loading times at the start of the game, and in-between cleared areas.\n\nThe game controls are easy to pick up, but perhaps a little twitchy - inevitably the downside of using an analogue stick. Too many times I accidentally placed a block by pressing down when I meant to move it left or right. But then I started to get used to it, with only the occasional error on my part.\n\nThere are many, many stages. Perhaps, my biggest gripe of all (and this applies to the PS4 version) is that there's no way to have a zen-like experience by practicing ALL the stages in Practice mode... you can only play about half of them, which is a shame. Perhaps this will be addressed in an update.\n\nOverall, do I recommend Tetris Effect? Wholeheartedly... Yes. You'll love it even more if you've never played the PS4 version as you won't have anything to compare it to. It's a very good game. But not a brilliant game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "drp2412208 days ago\nBreathtaking\n\nThis is art disguised as a game. Its Tetris at its core, which is fun and addicting already.

The levels are breath taking and the most emotionally immersive experience, invoking all kind of memories, like being on the Glade & Green Fields at Glastonbury festival. Skiing on a beautiful mountain. Walking in a forest.\n\nThe game interacts with the experience differently depending on the level. Every 10 lines causes the background to build somehow, bringing you deeper into the immersive world.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the music / audio experience which pulls it all together.

I understand the idea of matching the tempo of the game to the tempo of the song. But having the speed of the game wildly fluctuate with no warning when the song changes is a very very bad thing. Particularly when the speed hits 9 or 10 like it does on the last levels because at that point I'm not enjoying this cool space I get to play a game in, I'm just panicking as all my work slips away. And then I lose. I cannot beat the last part of the last song no matter how I try.

That is all well and good when you are in a room... but pretty terrible when you are on an airplane!

The music and animated backgrounds are not just simple loops, but evolve and change as you play, apparently taking cues from your actions and progress in the game. This adds up to a whole lot more than the sum of its parts, and really is a great experience. It's almost a rhythm game: you'll find yourself moving pieces in time with the music and getting into the flow.\n\nIt can be relaxing/meditative on slower levels, but the faster levels get pretty hectic, but there after time of settings and different modes so you can pick and choose based on your current mood.\n\nSo yeah, it's just Tetris, but the VR environments and music really do add something new and it's much more than the sum of its parts.\n\nDocked one star for the price - this would be an easier buy at $15 or $20.\n\nHelpful | 11", "david508Jul 24 at 1:00 PM\nNot what I expect from a VR perspective\n\nYou can definitely get your zen on with this game I suppose.

I thought you can use your hands to manipulate the blocks, do hard drops by throwing it down, basically all hand/controller gestures to play this game in its VR form, but sadly not even close. Its all with the thumb sticks and buttons, not exciting to say the least. This could of been so much more from a VR stand point, the only advantage is the graphics surrounding the game board itself.\nSo disappointing, even when you start the game for the first time, you have to navigate to figure things out, find the demos and instructions yourself since it doesn't present itself from the beginning or go thru anything for that matter.\n\nHelpful | 2", "SambaQJun 17 at 11:09 PM\nChallenging and amazing fun game\n\nIts so beautiful, sometimes I cant concentrate on the game I just want to watch the VR world.

I'm a huge fan of the Tetris franchise and I'm starting to become considerably good at the game. So this was a must buy for me.\n\nThe good stuff\nThis game is full of content, especially for seasoned players. The different Effect Modes sure could teach me a few more skills. Coming from Puyo Puyo Tetris I enjoyed its non-compatitive equivalent of Big Bang mode (a mode in which you need to clear your entire field with a given set of tetrominos).\n\nThe not so good stuff\nLet's face it. The visuals could be better. The particle effects look washed out and even though they are still kind of nice to look at, I imagine the PSVR and PCVR versions are far superior in this department.\nWhat's more important (to me) is that the game tends to lag, sometimes for no apparent reason. As a player striving for highscores and SS ranks I feel like unnecessarily hindered by the occasional lag to the point where I get uncomfortable with playing the game (not in a nausea-induced way, though).Sadly, I couldn't find an option to turn down effects in order to make the game run smoothly all the time.\n\nI really would love to incorporate Tetris Effect into my Tetris Training routine, but as it stands I rather feel ripped off 30 for an inferior port and I don't want to spend money twice in order to get the real deal.

For Tetris. Let that sink in for a moment. Tetris, a thirty six year old game that originally ran on cold war era microcomputers, now runs on the Unreal engine and takes sixty seconds to load initially, then fifteen seconds every time after that. FOR TETRIS. Why? It's not loading from a disc. This isn't the 5th console gen. This isn't Lumines on PSP. It's loading from fast, solid state memory. How can TETRIS have a loading meter? AND I HAVE TO CLICK THROUGH FOUR SCREENS OF LOGOS BEFORE I EVEN GET TO THE MENU.\n\nI digress. The next sin is that it's thirty dollars. I wanted to put some choice words in here but I'm trying not to give any excuses to take the review down. Thirty dollars for Tetris? Why? Because there's distracting visual fluff littering your peripheral vision, while you play a game about falling blocks? Yes, I bought it, because Quest is starved for content and I like Tetris. When it's cheap, starts instantly and controls properly. Which brings me to complaint number three.\n\nThere appears to be no insta-drop button. Maybe I'm a big dummy and somehow overlooked it? Maybe it's a button combo for some reason? I can understand the desire to prevent people generally unfamiliar with VR controls from accidentally dropping pieces, but then why not give us the ability to turn that feature on or off in the menu? I shouldn't have to sit here like a dink holding down on the analogue stick to drop pieces if I know where I want them to go and have them vertically aligned within a second of their appearance at the top of the playfield.\n\nWho is rating this garbage five stars? Were you dropped on your head? Do you clap and giggle at any flashing colored lights brought within your field of view? Does generic mall music enhance a falling blocks game THAT MUCH for you? I feel as if you'd get just as much joy from jangly keys and I'd do that for free. One star.\n\nHelpful | 26\nDeveloper ResponseMay 19 at 12:06 PM\n\nHi! Thanks for your feedback.

So much potential and you put out a 2D version of Tetris with special fish sound effects? Theres loops that run and freeze the game for Petes sake! Its 2D in a VR environment. Is this amateur hour? Why not 3D blocks that we need to plug into concave wall around us? Why not filling out creatively shaped frames with the traditional block arraignments? Mine craft accomplishes stacking 3D blocks with the crappiest graphics since commodore64. This is a revenue play and they tarnished the name and the classic game. The developers should be ashamed to put this out. Enjoy your gimmick money for capitalizing on a name and a loyal fan base. You wont sell a second version unless youre selling it to the half-wits that rated it 5 stars. Who are those people anyway? Was this offered as a free trial in the brain injury ward? Oh if you program any of my ideas from here into the game without paying me royalties Im suing you losers. If youre incapable of generating a decent idea to make this game worthy of its name on a VR platform at least contact me for help.

Someone wrote about the drops syncing with music and that really didn't do anything for me. It's hard to not like this classic game, but there is no added extra or oomph to this game. It's just so expensive for what you get. (Now, maybe it's priced appropriately for the hard work of the devs in regards to visuals and sound, but for a consumer, not worth it.) Unfortunately missed the time to refund it. I'll let other non-VR gamers play it, maybe they'll like it more. But for just a bit more money, I'd buy a used gameboy and Tetris classic.\n\nChanges that would improve my opinions is more variety of environments that are fun and different, not just environmental, under water stuff.

What I don't understand is why it's so downgraded - you go and play games like Beat Saber and Pistol Whip and Star Wars and they look amazing. But this game, which doesn't push the limits of anything, is running at a fairly low resolution -- at least compared to desktop. I normally wouldn't care, but the entire appeal of this game is the amazing visuals, it really makes you feel like you're playing something special on desktop. But on the Quest, it's just sort of, well, Tetris -- the same Tetris you've played a million times. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, I like Tetris which is why I bought this, but the downgrade here is extensive, and I don't know why. Hopefully they patch this and improve the resolution and effects so people know why this game was so insanely highly rated on PSVR.

And from the trailers it's hard to showcase exactly how VR could make this different, but when the entire scenery envelops your vision and you're focused on the gameplay, the vibration on your controllers syncing to every movement you do, and the beat of the song thumping and gradually speeding up to match the Rhythm and flow of the game, you find yourself naturally getting better at the at the game making split-second decisions without a thought just because of how in the zone you are.\nCalling this just another version of tetris is a disservice to everything these developers worked hard to do. they created a spiritual journey in this game, while that might sound silly it's the plain truth. I've been driven to Tears by this game in it's previous release, and it's done so again in this version. If there ever was a game that can embody Euphoria, this is it.\nThe price tag might seem steep, but after you find yourself draining the quest is battery in a single session, you won't doubt that it's worth its price twice over.\nAny visual downgrade from its previous versions are hardly noticeable while playing, the only major problem I would find with this is that the Oculus touch thumbsticks are not really ideal for the Tetris gameplay, they could be a bit sensitive and I found myself accidentally hard dropping every once in awhile. Tetris is more suited for a d-pad, but you can get used to it or use a third-party gamepad.

On some occasions on the playstation 4 version there would be some instances where the controls would \"lag\" to where the input wouldn't be recognized causing you to misplace the piece that is in play. This problem pursists in this port for both game pad and touch controller. If you are using a gamepad wirlessly than expect a much larger degree of lag compared to a wired or touch controller experience.\n\nHelpful | 4", "NinjaChurchJul 11 at 9:26 PM\nFantastic Tetris Experience\n\nEngaging modes with excellent presentation.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DonskibearMay 29 at 4:02 PM\nWow Tetris on acid :)\n\nStunning and addictive and Christine and the Queens soundtrack blew me away.

It's the kind of spaced-out/LSD-trip vibe I'd been hoping to find on Quest. It helps if you're into minimal electronic music (I am) and the associated imagery/culture of that whole scene. If so, you'll get what this game is trying to do (and succeeds) by being the sort of trance-inducing/hallucinogenic experience. Every time you move a piece around or rotate it you're essentially composing a layer of the background music that's unique each time. It's pretty amazing that it always sounds good (always in key), and that's a big part of the appeal. There's actually more to the new mechanics as it's now possible to score even more than a Tetris at a time (Octris, and even higher). Using the new mechanic adds a new layer of strategy to classic Tetris.

Its controls, mechanics, the way it feels is just perfection. There have been several attempts of updating old games into a modern era and few manage to become better, in fact is usually the oposite. This game does it, it becomes better in every way while remaining pure to its simple essence. This is Tetris dam! The VR is top notch, it immerses you in a transe state where you sit down to play and time disappears. Seriously, first time I sat down and could not believe I was there 2 hours. Gameplay is a great combination of Zen and excitement. You release endorphins and adrenaline at the same time, like during love making! Yes, I said it: Tetris Effect is as good as sex!\n\nOn the Quest is even better than all previous versions because of the versatility of it. The Gameboy Tetris was a smash hit cause of the same reason, it was easy to pick and play anywhere anytime. This is the new modern equivalent. Sure, there are people who stops to count how many particles there are on the screen and say with a dumb voice tha PC varsion haz 357,421 particklez on screen and this haz 318,911 but these people dont get it  you get the full experience here: the music, the feel, the perfect controls, the magical trip.\n\nBuy this game.
