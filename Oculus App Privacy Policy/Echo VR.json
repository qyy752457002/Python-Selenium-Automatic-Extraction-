As being a part of the more competitive side of the game by competing in VRML and things like that the matchmaking is not very fair and is rarely a close match usually its one team getting destroyed\n\n2. It would be nice if they brought back events like the summer one and decorate the lobby differently for different occasions because it gets boring after a while.\n\n3. The game could use more cosmetics like mabey even a battle pass which would get them more money and have a bigger variety of customizations\n\n4. Finally quest people have been waiting on combat because it completes the game and makes it twice as enjoyable so it would be helpful if we got told around when it will be released.\n\nP.S. fix the tracking, its really bad sometimes :)\n\nHelpful | 54", "CompanionCubePrimerJul 4 at 1:46 PM\nBut no combat\n\nThis is a great port of the original pc game but I quickly noticed that combat was missing and it seems that they glanced over it in game play but on the page they do not mention it at all so I would be very grateful if someone could at least give a estimated time of when combat would be released I probably sound like a entitled brat but I just love this game and I want the port to be just as good as the pc game\n\nHelpful | 376", "amazingwarrior10121 days ago\nAmazing game!!\n\nThis game for being free is amazing here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Has a good progression system: as any of the players level up they get to make their chassis of the robot look however you want as well as your name tag as the name tag similar to games like cod but you can see everyones names.\n2. You can talk and chat to other people and if you dont want to chat with anyone then you can just mute everyone.\n3. Lots of the players have been good to the new players that have just finished the tutorials.\n4. Has a tutorial right off the bat and doesnt just leave you to try to find it like games like Fortnite were you have to buy STW to even have a tutorial.\nCons:\n1. Some of the players in the matches can be really toxic and ruin that match for everyone else sure you could try to mute them but you miss out on part of the game.\n2. Does not have echo combat (I would pay an extra 10 bucks than the usual price for that.) this would be amazing for quest.\nHere are some suggestions that would possibly help the game and make it better:\n1. Have skill/level based matchmaking this would allow for people around the same level and skill to play against each other of course this could be disabled in the pause menu and would be unlocked after level ten.\n2. Echo combat some version of this would be epic for quest without use of virtual desktop or oculus link maybe allow players that are are level 50 to be able to play on the closed beta if the game decides to port combat over too.\n3. More customization options like other warm and cool colors for the chassis maybe even a rainbow option for reaching max level.\n4. More levels above the max currently I believe it maxes out at rank 50 and what so the game developers could add more levels up 100 or more or... once you reach level 50 you could reset your level to level 1 or 2 but are given a new customizable chassis or just special customization options.\nThats about it for my review on this game I will update this if any of this gets added and i will make another review on this if combat gets added later on. So in conclusion this game is totally worth trying out for the low low price of being free!!\n\nHelpful | 8", "brandtclan1Jul 3 at 10:47 AM\nBEST SPORT VR GAME EVER! But...\n\nThe fact that it has 0 gravity makes you think your literally floating in space! But one problem. Why cant we do the combat mode on quest? Please let us purchase combat on quest. That would be great!\n\n\nNewer review: I recently discovered that you can play combat if you plug it in to a compatible pc, but we dont have that. So once again, if you could add echo combat to the quest (without having to plug it in to a pc) that would be great!\n\nHelpful | 35", "3lmo5119 days ago\nAmazing game! Just one thing....\n\nIn my opinion this is the BEST game in the oculus quest store, I love playing this and I dont find very many toxic players. I can keep my cool very easily so if a little kid is trash talking I usually just mute them. I know this isnt the developers fault but there is a fair amount of annoying little kids playing the game. And when their parents write a bad review on the game because someone else was cussing or being inappropriate I dont think thats very fair because thats just what happens in online games. I was looking through some of the reviews and found one where this womans 7 year old daughter was playing and afterwards left it on and when her mom went to shut it off someone was acting as if he was fingering her in the game. And that just happens, and people have to realize this. If parents are letting their young kids play an online game like this then they cant expect it to be completely family friendly, just because a little kid is playing doesnt mean somebody will be like Oh guys we have to be nice a kid is here thats just not how it works. So either dont let your kid play if they get exposed to inappropriate actions or accept that that will happen and let them play.\n\nHelpful | 2", "MadBraxMay 5 at 11:46 AM\nThink Rocket League, but Zero-G\n\nThis game is kinda difficult to explain to someone who hasn't seen it before.

Recon I got the game with my quest. Idk how much it costs, but it is a football like game.

The game is fun and I can never put it down. It does use a lot of battery quick, but I can play for a good 5 hours a day. My left thumb does get soar after a while of pushing the joystick for the boost. Would love it if it changed to be the X button. Same with brake, hope it can become A. Not going to lie, I saw the adds on this game, was ready and waiting with 30 dollars to buy it, so excited when it said free instead of 29.99. Should totally be at least 20 dollars, but it is a social game and all social games are free so it makes a little sense.\n\nGraphics: 5/5\nControls: 4/5\nGameplay: 5/5\nLobby: 4/5(needs more stuff)\nArena: 5/5\nOver all it is a great game. 100% recommended.\n\n\nSome things I want updated, sorry about it being long, lots of potential\n1. Combat on the quest, I here so many rift players talking about it and it makes me sad, I want to get to the shooting range but it is not possible. If it came out on quest, I would make absolutely no hesitation in getting it. Quest is missing out.\n2. Personal disc, I think there should be a personal disc anywhere in the lobby, not just one room.\n3. Lobby, there should be more stuff in the lobby to mess around with (how do you use the spaceship, is there a button that makes it go forward?) if the devs do the whole personal disc thing anywhere in the lobby, there should be targets in random places to help increase everyones accuracy.\n4. Kick gun, there should be some sort of gun to kick people from the game, mainly people who are lagging so hard they just carry the entire team, one minute, I have it, 2 seconds later, I dont have it and the person who is laggy is about to score. Please fix this.\n5. Levels, I know the max level is 50, but that should just be the level where you have all the items, would like if you continually level up so it is more spaced out where its not a VRML player verses a not so good level fifty player like me. When there is VRML players in the game, that team dominates unless there is one on each team.\n6. New maps! Lots of reviews say new maps, it does get old, playing the same map.\nLast thing. I know, I sound like a person who gets everything they want. But maybe, you can add a ranged stun gun to stun people who are ___ meters away. But maybe if you do this, you can unlock different guns. Like a sniper, or a shotgun. You could press a button on the controller and the weapon appears in your hand, or u shoot a mini disc out of ur wrist and if it hits a block either by the goals or in the middle. I mean the little cubes you can go through or grab. When you hit any of them, it has a little timer then it explodes and stuns any who are near. Or it becomes a turret that glows the color of your team and provides some cover until it is destroyed by a punch, or maybe the stun gun!\n\nI know, I have said a lot of things that could be updated, but these things could make the game much better.\nDespite these things 5/5 stars is the easiest decision of my life.

They are loud and frustrating, they are constantly screaming and moaning and generally making your playing experience a bit rubbish. You can mute them but you have to mute every time you finish a game or start a game.\n\nThe arena could be more interesting, possibly generative? Probably a lot of work for the devs but this game quickly gets boring when you are playing the same space each time.\n\nIt would be good to be able to clan up and have a tournament style game. Possibly a bit like Enders Game, which this is clearly inspired by. The book talks about the different teams in a much more in depth way and I think this game could benefit from this considerably.\n\nThe quest does not have all of the features. This would be worth ironing out as I'm guessing a large amount of users are on the quest.\n\nOptions for longer/shorter games could be worthwhile. Better XP for the awards also?\n\nThat's it really.

I'm level 35 and still enjoy this game. Even on quest with decreased texture quality this game still looks fine and isn't that noticeable. Although the only mode available right now is arena, I've played several hours in arena but still would like combat so I have more content to enjoy.\n\nExplaining this game to others can be difficult though (and extremely painful to watch), and if you're like me and show off quest to lots of people; I would not recommend it. Another thing is that if you get really bad motion sickness, DO NOT ENABLE PITCH. By enabling pitch using the right joystick, will make you upside down or to the side. I do not experience any motion sickness while playing, but advise you do keep that info in mind.\n\nThis game has a really active and live community and when I started as a noob people were willing to teach me how to play and were really helpful. As I got into to higher skilled games I met lots of 7 yr old squeakers and toxic teenagers. This didn't stop me from playing though, and till this day I utterly enjoy this game still.

First of all, IT IS FREE. Secondly it is an amazing game and with the quest headset you can really take advantage of the no wires as you can just quickly dash around with worrying about a CHONKY pc to rip off your desk. Not only does this game add fun into your lonely sad depressed life it also adds fitness into your life. You can meet a variety of different people with different tactics and skill and if you get lucky, you can meet them again in a future game or lobby. The greatest part of this game is being social and hanging out with your friends and people who you dont even know. The lobby is the best place to experience this. You can be in the mini arena and practice your shooting accuracy while getting tackled by a fellow player or get whacked in the brawler room. You can go into the echo training arena of course which gives you an exact replica of one of the sides in the actual map. If someone is hogging the disk, it doesnt matter just whip out ur personal disk and even take it anywhere around the lobby ( if you know the right glitches). This game has a wide variety of things to do and all in on sport. You can train and train and train to try and get into the virtual reality masters league and go against other great teams in the 4 v 4 tournament of this amazing game.

Ive had it since it first came on the Oculus Rift, and now that I have it on the Quest where there is no chord to get in the way, its so much fun.\n\nI would really like to see a better multiplayer settings added in the future. For example, I met someone in that I enjoyed playing with, but we couldnt continue to play matches because you have to be in the same lobby or arena with them to add them to a party. We had already been separated into different lobbies by the time we had tried to join a party together.\n\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to report players easier. There are some very annoying people that play this game and sometimes harass other players, and you cant really do anything about it. One person followed me around the entire match and punched me about every two seconds. He ended up getting the bruiser achievement and leveled up while I was prevented from even playing the game, due to the fact that I was constantly being stunned.\n\nI really do love this game, despite the minor problems, and I cant wait to see what the developers bring out next!\n\nHelpful | 0", "ZadyLeeJun 22 at 5:36 PM\nThe best Quest Game, and its FREE\n\nHonestly.

The only downside is that the game has bugs and crashes every once in awhile but most bugs aren't major and can be fixed by putting the headset in standby and putting it on again although the crashes are kinda annoying. They don't happen frequently though because I play this game daily for at least 2 hours and the crashes only happen about once a week. The social aspect of this game is awesome! People are so nice and it is really fun to play this with random people. Anyways If it's free FRICKIN GET IT RIGHT NOW but if it isn't I would still buy it if I were you.

It is easy to get the hang of, but very challenging to master.\n\n- Great Matchmaking. This game effectively puts you against other players based on a wide variety of statistics! Whatever skill level you are at, it is consistently fun all through.\n\n- Full virtual body! Tired of being a floating pair of hands and a head? Look no further, Echo VR offers amazing inverse kinematics, giving you a full robotic body! This includes arms, legs, and everything in between!\n\n- Diverse customisation! Character customisation is better than ever in Echo VR. There is a broad range of colours, patterns, decals and so much more! Create your dream robot.\n\n- IT IS FREE! What are you waiting for?

The gameplay is super fun cause you get to mock the losers. I cant wait for its official launch on quest so I can use Combat mode(hopefully). Its free and yet its better than most games. Ive even seen some graphical updates. You should however make an option to report someone for things like profanity and harassment and the game will review them to see if they have any other reports regarding the same thing. You should also add a function to allow people in your party to use the same personal disk, or maybe add a completely different option where party leader can summon a party disk so just you and your members can practice together in the lobby.maybe also change up the music a little bit. Maybe every 10 minutes the lobby will change to a variety of 5 different songs. You should also add things like hats or accessories for your characters. Plus a credit for when playing games based on what you did you could earn points, where you can buy mystery boxes for hats and stuff to add en extra uniqueness to avatars.

Currently only the beta is out as I write this and we can only play matches with random players and cant rematch with the same people. I think something like this should be kept in the main game! Reason being it keeps an even level across both teams and allows new players to still enjoy the game without being over whelmed by experienced players. When the full game comes out I imagine we will be able to group with our friends, create teams and rematch with other players which will lead to advanced plays and strategies which will lead to some nearly unbeatable teams and be too much for new players, possibly putting them off. So yeah having this random game match up mode will really help that. You probs already know this though.\n\nReview\nIts amazing! Go get it now. When you play it for the first time give yourself a good 4 hours because you wont want to leave once your in it. Its basically ultimate frisbee in zero gravity with full contact. Gameplay and mechanics are incredible. If your new to vr you may find it a bit too much and get a bit motion sick so beware. Its the interaction that really makes this game sing, something which a lot of other games could really do with. Ive had so many laughs with random people as everyone is buzzing and there to enjoy it. Despite being a very competitive game its rare that Ive found real negativity amongst players. Will be interesting to see if that changes as time goes on. I can see people making a lot of new friends and connections in the virtual world through this game. Im terrible at this game and rarely get the disc but still find it great fun. And when you score its an amazing feeling! A co op based objective married with a tricky yet freeing movement mechanic really works in a VR environment and could be a great starting point for many other games in the future. The pacing is fast and exciting but not much to the point that it becomes too twitchy and arcady.

Getting stunned is quite jarring, especially when its not expected. Maybe make it so that getting stunned slows you to a stop rather than instantly halting your movement. Also maybe make it more obvious how long a stun lasts, maybe with a more obvious visual queue like a red haze around your FOV.\n3. Make some kind of audio queue for when someone grabs you, or make the existing one louder, same with someone activating their fists. Would make fistfights far more intuitive.\n4. Theres a very good reason why offside exists in soccer, maybe make some kind of mechanic that compensated for this?\n5. Grabbing the disk while its stuck in the goals causes an out of body experience.\n6. The narrator is kind of annoying, can there be a way to turn him off?\n7. The Quests hand tracking only updates at 30fps, maybe make some of the hit boxes a tad larger to compensate for this\n8. Add more particles and things to goals to make them more satisfying.\n9.

Im not saying that that is something that should happen, because I can see how it would make the game a whole lot more complicated, but it would give people another skill to master.\n\nOne last thing about this INCREDIBLE game. Is Echo Combat ever going to come out on Quest? I think it would make the entire game package at least 10 times better, and give the players of quest a more varied and exciting time when playing this awesome game.\n\nAnyway, this game deserves a total two thumbs up, five stars, this is my favorite game since beat saber! Keep up the amazing work youre doing!\n\nHelpful | 0", "MadHatter42May 22 at 10:30 PM\nWow cool game!!\n\nI can totally imagine what 0 gravity feels like with this game. Its fun. I agree with other reviews that it has a learning curve to it, but after a tutorial you can hang out in the lobby and practice grabbing and throwing random things they have floating about. Play catch with someone until your ready to play. For the most part other players are cool. If you find them annoying or dropping the F bomb to much you can mute certain players and still play the game.\n\nCouple bugs Ive experienced though, my screen went blank once and I could only hear the other players and see their user names moving about. And another time I just went blank for 15 sec and came back like nothing happened. Thought it was my Oculus but I just think its some kinks that needs worked out.\n\nOne Warning. If you suffer from motion sickness play at your own risk. I found I can handle one game before I need to break. But its so much fun Ill push it and play two.\n\nHelpful | 0", "evanbutler23Jul 3 at 1:25 AM\nAwesome game\n\nSo fun to play like enders game meets tron only problem is the toxic 12yr old brats\n\nHelpful | 0", "lolingcow42Jun 18 at 4:00 PM\n\nIts a really fun game to play when you have nothing to do but be sure to stand in a high roofed area because you might break a light fixture like I did\n\nHelpful | 0", "NerdGamer4224Jul 1 at 12:39 PM\nAmazing\n\nOn paper the idea of Zero-g frisbee is weird by this games makes it better than you could've ever imagined.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Pichi0104Jul 12 at 8:52 AM\nFun game but Most Toxic Community.\n\nI love this game all of it but if you can withstand being called racial slurs and being cursed at because you are being too cocky like me then dont buy this game.

By that i mean the throwing mechanics feel natural, and skills like anticipating \"ball movement\" or throwing to a person in motion all felt very lifelike and I was impressed.\n\nMany would agree one of the bigger issues of VR is the \"isolation\" aspect of it. I think games like this that bring a lot of people together (multiplayer, and in this case 4v4 plus lobby interaction) paint a bright future for VR.\n\nRandom people humping your face can be an issue since it is 0G, but they have even addressed that concern by allowing you to \"mute\" people's avatars in lobby by making them a bright dot instead. By far most people I met playing were pleasant and well behaved.\n\nI think it is difficult to call any one game the definitive \"best game in store\" which is why I call this a top 3. It is in the top echelon for me because when I tried it I was like \"wow, this is a new level of VR immersion\" and I'd never really experienced anything like it, and I have tried most things in the store by now.\n\nI see this game as a system seller (granted I am biased as I am already a fan of sports).\n\nHelpful | 1", "WentlleJun 10 at 8:02 PM\nSPECTACULAR\n\nA near PERFECT port of the original!

The only frustration I had with it so far is that the game benefits those with a worse connection, becoming dramatically more noticeable at very high pings.\n\nA person in one of my games had 700 ping and multiple times throughout the match intercepted the disc after it had already gone multiple meters past them the other direction. This caused the entire team to be out of position (since the disc essentially teleported back to their hands the opposite way) and easy goals to be scored.\n\nThis happening multiple times in the match made it clear how much this could be exploited by nefarious players if not properly dealt with.\n\nThe person with the laggy connection should be the one to have confusion about where the disc is and why they could not catch it, not the 7 other players who immediately go wait, what? when the disc disappears from in front of them.\n\nOther then that though, the game is great.

I play this to workout, when Im bored, and especially when Im in a good mood. Lots of good people and lots of bad people but overall, the community is a beautiful place. I open up the game and it greats me with a thorough, and long, tutorial. At first I was annoyed at this unskippable walkthrough but after playing I realize it would be difficult to play this game self-taught. Once in a lobby you can go straight to the terminal and find a game, or make friends in different training areas, chasing them through the vents, and even playing keep away with a few Knick-knacks scattered around the place. Beautiful area but this is where my disappointment sets in. Hopping into the game I didnt know much about Echo at all but I soon came to find that the Combat area is currently locked. Although the highly active, zero-gravity ultimate frisbee like game mode is enjoyable, Id love to experience Combat on Quest. The guns and zero-gravity make you feel like you are a character in Enders Game and I hope the people at RAD will soon be able to port this part of game to Quest soon. Overall, Id pay a full $60 for this game and will continue to play the Beta till it comes out. A definite buy for me and something a VR fanatic is going to love.

Iv only encountered a few bugs but they dont significantly hurt the main experience. I love the tron-esque feel to it.\n\nIv never really thought this was necessary in past games, but this one definitely needs an age filter of some kind. The vast majority of players you will find while playing are young kids and its not very enjoyable to hear them yelling about whatever each game. Furthermore, voice chat is turned on every time you switch between lobby and game, making it rather annoying to have to hear them every time. Perhaps its just a part of the experience within the genre, but the amount of time I hear kids who cant be more than 13 years old talking about sex can be extremely disturbing.\n\n\nIll update this review if a future update limits the amount of children Im forced to listen to haha.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Zer0TheHer0May 15 at 7:27 AM\nOne of the best games I've played...\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to play a game like roller ball or the disc fighting from tron?

Ive looked through the other reviews and seen many people say that the worst part of the game is the people which can sometimes be the case but for the most part its no worse than a normal first person shooter in relation to the people on the game. And really if people can only complain about the types of people on the game which is one aspect they cant control unless they want the game to not be fun Id say there is absolutely nothing wrong with the game itself accept that the quest cant play in combat.

But now that the open beta is out there are a lot of kids 8-11 years old that just rule over the online matches. It's gotten to the point where its ruined online matches for me. These kids always fight for the ball, go around targeting one person and punching them, and they always mock you when you lose or get punched and are just all around toxic. Most importantly they never cooperate with the team and just go straight for the disc without a plan and mock me and make fun of me when I try to tell them a plan.

First impressions: it's amazing! I love having a full body, it is very immersive. I was skeptical of the \"zero g\" effect at first, as your body is still feeling gravity in the real world, but after playing, I can say I was completely wrong. It really does feel like you are in space, and the physics feel very realistic. The multiplayer social hub is very fun, and I find myself hanging out there often with friends. The controls are pretty good overall, and the combat system is fun as well. As it is in beta, the menu looks pretty bland, but you don't see that except when you start up the game as matchmaking is done from the multiplayer lobby. The only bug I noticed was that if I tried to go to the Oculus home while in game, to check the time or something, the game would sometimes completely crash.\n\nOnly thing I would ask the devs to change, and this is something that probably only affects me and a few others, is to add an option to turn artificial turning off completely. I have a big play space and prefer to turn in the real world for full immersion, and I find myself accidentally artificially turning when trying to brake. Other than that, it's a great game. And it is free! So might as well get it!\n\nEDIT: I figured out that if you turn on smooth turning and then set the turn rate to 0, it turns off artificial turning.

You shouldn't have to grab the disk to effect it's path. This would make playing goalie a lot more practical. Certainly, to direct it's path you should have to grab it, but if I hit it with my hand it should be sent in another direction.\n\n2. I don't like having to mute all every time I come into the main room or arena. If I make a selection of that sort, it should stay in place until I reverse it.\n\n3. Is there a place to check one's overall stats, in terms of goals, stuns, saves and assists? I'm a stats guy and would like to see that.\n\n4.

Using propulsion systems and a momentum based climbing dynamic, you fly your way around the pitch and attempt to score or goaltend. The controls feel like nothing else you can play and are a beacon for the future of VR.\nWhy did I review it badly then?\nWell what really lets this down is the community. When you load in, you are dropped into a lobby. By default, players are full bodied Avis with chat enabled. They can grab and interact with you and chat. Can you imagine a room full of English teenagers & Xbox 360 era squeakers all grabbing you / throwing things and screaming insults? I haven't seen such a beginner unfriendly MP game since the MW2 git gud era. Luckily you can reduce other players to destiny style ghost orbs and mute them. But you have no such luck in the game.\nThe worst mechanic there is the ability to stun other people. At the moment paying the game is secondary to following noobs around repeatedly hitting them to stun them.\nHopefully adjustments to the game (including getting it out of beta and paid rather than free) go some way to fix this.

Unfortunately we did not have a great experience on our first attempt, but it wasnt due to the developers. I was very excited about the multiplayer opportunity because I got stuck 2500 miles away from my family when the stay at home went into effect. Weve stayed connected as a family largely through playing games together on our Quests. The developers of Echo VR have done an outstanding job, and each of us downloaded the game, went through the tutorials and practiced on our own until we felt ready to play together. Unfortunately, the night we tried to play there were several people in the lobby who made it really hard for us to have fun. It seemed like their entire purpose for being there was to harass and be obnoxious to others. Two of them ganged up on me the minute I entered the lobby, and even when we ghosted them they continued to follow us around like annoying bees. When we were finally able to play a game, we had hoped to be able to stumble through as team members, but found ourselves in a game with a large group of seemingly much better players. There didnt seem to be any way to create smaller games of 4-6 players. If there was a way we could at least create a game were we were on the same team of four it might be worth trying again. Maybe if we hadnt been trying to get out of the lobby and away from the people who were harassing us as quickly as we could, we might have been able to figure out how to do that, or if its even possible. Unfortunately well probably just stick with the paid games we have now in order to avoid the people who go into the free games just to cause trouble. Its a shame that our experience was ruined by a few people. This is an amazing game and Im glad that not everyone had a first experience like ours.

The game itself never seems dragged on or boring because the disc is constantly changing hands and being passed up and down zones, most of the people you play with or against are good when it comes to sportsmanship, but you can always find that person who can't stand to lose and can't handle winning. It may seem that when you first start that you kinda suck but, after a little bit of practice and a few games you will start get the hang of it.

As a woman, Ive been playing for some time and aside from having to mute occasional sexual harassment, have had very little problems thus far. Im a founding member of the Ladies Oculus Quest Facebook page. Within the first hour of her use, she was pinned down by a player in the lobby several times without the means to stop him other than leaving the game all together. She refused to leave the game, and tried to get away from him and record using the Oculus home button, but was kicked out of the server every time she tried to record. Once she finally rejoined my party and told me what happened, she was almost in tears. I tried to record using my Oculus button (just to see if I could record if I wanted to), but it didnt work. I dont know if this is a glitch that needs to be fixed, but it needs to be addressed asap. The person harassing her was not a child. She said his voice was that of a grown man. Unfortunately, in the chaos of the harassment, she was unable to obtain his username. Other players in the lobby were trying to report him and pull him off of her, but they did not know how. Please make it easier to report abusive behaviors in this game. If not, Im afraid other novice female Quest users will not enjoy this game to the fullest extent. Other than that, I absolutely love this game.\nUpdate: Quest home button record option now works. Thank you! I still wish there was an easier way to report, but having the option to record does make me feel more comfortable playing the game. Could you please add a report option after a video has been recorded? That would make it much easier.

There's tons of strategy and teamwork is required to win. Although there is a huge skill gap, one guy can single handlely take on the whole enemy team and still score, while some players still are figuring out how to play the game. Also I feel like there should be an underdog system, and if one team get a lead of 5-7 then their goal gets bigger so the other team has a slightly higher chance of scoring at least once. The biggest problem with the game is one team gets a huge lead and the other team has no chance, because the mercy rule is so high.

The tutorial is a bit too long but once you finished it you can access the main lobby and arena games. There is only one game mode in this beta (Combat costs 10 dollars and will hopefully be added to the quest in the final version) but I had so much fun in the lobby with other people that I spent 2 hours in it. The arena game itself is pretty fun. Its about throwing a disc in a goal while floating in zero g. You can stun enemies and force them to drop the disk. If they block, youll get stunned. It sometimes takes less than 10 seconds for a team to make a goal, sometimes 3 minutes. Whats best about the game in my opinion is the lobby though. Ive met a lot of nice people. We were having fun, playing against each other in the training room, boxing each other in the boxing area or stealing the disk from each other in the whole lobby.\n\nThis game is such a great one and the best thing: Its free!

The untethered experience is perfect for Echo VR.\n\nMy opinion on things that need to be addressed:\n\n1.) Latency and rubberbanding. Players who have high ping make the disk teleport making it hard to predict gameplay. I assume it's just based on which server location we play on. I want to give the players the benefit of the doubt when they have 500+ ping. It could be the players internet too so I don't know.\n\n2.) Bug. Sometimes when I grab the disk while boosting with the wrist thrusters, while still holding the buttons with disk in hand the wrist thrusters just don't respond. I would have to repress the boost buttons to start boosting again.\n\n3.) Oculus UI during gameplay. I would love to have the headset alert me when I am low on battery.

There are still issues of being kicked out of servers, but I understand the Beta process of the games and look forward to hopefully having combat mode in the future.\n\n\n\nI am posting this in reviews because I could not find a clear path to help me. I just got this game today. I was having fun and enjoyed it.... until I got harrassed to a point that other players.... in the lobby.. were physically grabbing a player off of my avatar and we couldn't figure out how to report, other than mute/ghost. The offending player said...\" you can always leave\" There needs to be a clearer way to report someone like this. It was upsetting. When I tried to record. It kicked me out of the server. I hope you will take this feedback seriously. You can look up my time online. I had to keep running from this player. He kept getting in the way of my ability to use the online screen. And when I did finally get bullied out. The game crashed. And I could not get back in without a reset. All I wanted to do was rejoin the party I was having fun with. I do appreciate the other players who were trying to help me. I hope I am heard. Other than that great game.\n\nHelpful | 3", "cruzchristopher68May 6 at 6:42 PM\nFinally! A VR game made for ME!\n\nAs much as I like VR, most games in that medium felt really short to the point where I completed each of them in less than a day. Also, I just so happen to be a fan of E-sports (mostly Rocket League and Overwatch). So when I heard of this game, I was immediately excited (and maybe a little impatient) for it to be coming out.\nNow that I've played it in open beta (in which it doesn't honestly feel like), I'M IN LOVE! The controls were intuitive, the gameplay was tight, the graphics were well done, and it's REALLY addictive. It's about time we've got a VR E-sport.\nMy only gripe is that combat is not available on the quest (probably because it might take up more space, but it is an \"Open Beta\", so it might be added in the final game) Other than that, would highly reccomend!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Merle0004May 6 at 7:30 PM\nSo far the best thing on quest.\n\nThis game is the best thing on quest and the funny thing is it's only a beta!!

First off the game feels great. Once you get a hang of the control it gets very fluid and fun. The actual gameplay is great and very energetic! It feels so satisfying outplaying other players and moving around the environment feels great. The wirelesses Of the quest makes the game even better!!! Its super immersive, Ive punched my wall many a time trying to get the disc, even hitting my ceiling fan.\n\nThe community of the game is I think the best part. At all hours there are good people on just wanting to play and Ive met some pretty cool people. That being said there is the bad Apple once and a while that can make people uncomfortable or is just mean spirited. But even in matches after every score people say good shot or nice goal and feels very welcoming.\n\nThe only thing I wish the game would have is a party button so you can add people in your lobby to a game without having to friend them. If not that then something to easily friend people in your lobby so you can join up with them.\n\nOther than that it is an amazing game and perfectly utilizes the quest not to mention looking great.

They were extremely helpful in giving me a lobby tour, showing me around. One said I sounded like a \"father\" and I told him I have been playing video games for decades and that Pong on the Atari back in the 70s was my first gaming experience. I then proceeded into my first match and I fell in love with this game right away. And it's a great workout too. I was sweating in no time. What great exercise! And then I had my first match with the AI players who were really impressive. There were moments that I forgot they were just bots because they played good, honest, and realistic to human players. There are just a few bugs I encountered, but I bumped my rating as of now to 4 stars. Overall, I will be coming back for more matches for fun, excitement, and exercise!\n-------\nFormer two-star review: The graphics and movements are great. I enjoyed the tutorials too and I learned quickly. I was really hoping to play my first game . . . until I entered the lobby . . . that sounded like a children's' daycare center with loud, screaming kids floating all around me. I ghosted and muted all of them, but then I learned they were the ones who would probably be my teammates. Sorry, no thanks.

Can't find my hours played, but I've played around 170+ games. I have a few gripes, but really only one I think needs changing.\n\nMy only criticism that I think the game needs to attend to is wait times/transitions between rounds. The launch countdown is appropriate for positioning and planning, no problems there. It's that period right after a goal that takes far too long. I play goalie 99% of the time, and as many of you know - it's excruciating to improve your goaltending skills because A). It's not something you can do without a friend (outside of matches), B). You will spend less time being able to apply practical skills by nature of your position, and C). The wait time between goals. I see no reason why the 'fade to black' marking a round reset has to occur after ~10 seconds. It only drags the match on and extends time not playing the game. It should be 2-4 seconds on the delay. The same can also be said when the game is finished - after a frustrating game I want to quit out and get to the next one ASAP. Having to wait 10 seconds every time before I can collect my exp and leave is infuriating.\n\nI have a couple more issues that I see as very minor and don't care that much if it isn't addresses, but are worth mentioning. After completing the tutorial, I don't see why booting up the game doesn't immediately send you to the lobby. There's a lot of loading in this game, and the extra step doesn't make it better. I also don't see why the spawns in the lobby aren't closer to the matchmaking terminals. Again - just wastes more time.\n\nIt may be easy to read this and say \"Dude, it's like 10 seconds. Why does it matter?\" When I play Echo, I play a good many rounds. These small inconveniences really add up and make practicing skills lethargic and slow to reward improvement. This goes for anyone, but especially for people who want to hone their defensive skills. Great game, but these keep me from being able to sustainably enjoy it\n\nHelpful | 1", "dgibbsmanMay 7 at 11:11 PM\ngreat game\n\nthe beta is incredible. note, the training is cut short after the first time thru.

Seriously.\n\nHelpful | 5", "Dr_Xenix_LoxJun 11 at 11:56 PM\nA wonderful buggy gem\n\nSHORT ANSWER.\nIt is a fun game. Download it. It will give hours of enjoyment despite its flaws. Yes the game will irritate you sometimes, yes it can be a bit challenging to learn, but it is all worth it. Im giving only 3/5 because you need to be hard on the things you want to see succeed.\n-To those of you who havent gotten your sea legs yet dont worry, the more you play the less headaches, dizziness, and nausea youll feel. Like anything else you just need to get use to it and over time it will be like playing any other game.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nLets get to it. I love this game. I may only be lv 40, but I feel Ive experienced enough to share my opinion. I hope this will inform downloaders, maybe even get the community and devs talking.\n\nPros...\n-This game is extraordinarily satisfying. The physics work well when youre against people who arent smurfs (using an alternate account) or exploiting the game. From getting a goal, bounce shot, pass, or save.\n\n-Once you learn how to follow the disk the movement is great! From launching off objects to teammates to even just the normal thrusters youll always be learning how to optimize the zero-g movement.\n\nCons...\n-For one the game is a buggy mess some games. Ping makes the disk look like its in one place when its in another (leading to goals and missed grabs.) People lag switching around the map. Blocking doesnt work 50% of the time. The connection carries over to the servers themselves, occasionally kicking me and my team mates out of games.\n\n-On top of that people at the top are exploiting the games functions. People stun locking and camping a goalie (on top of the only defense of blocking not working from time to time) to where it is unfun and sometimes impossible to play defensively. Flailing the disk around or holding it in the body so that the goalie or defense cannot grab it can make it feel like the person with the disk has all the power. Yes they slow down a bit when holding the disk but they have so many tools (such as launching and crawling) that the addition of these seemingly unintended strategies feel unfair and discourage team work while inflating the use of individual prowess.\n\nEhs?\n-Since it feels like the grab prioritizes the body over the disk it can feel like youve been ripped out of a save. Though this could be due to the way people can move the disk around without any consequence.\n\n-For every good person you meet there are several screaming kids yelling and physically harassing your echo unit. (I wish there was a quick way to mute or report an account but you either mute everyone or need to report them through oculus)\n\n-The body and legs arent a hit box leading to people crawling around the floor evading 2-3 people effortlessly and the goalie being nothing but a head and a hand leading 1v1 goal situations to feel very striker favored (once they get in the 2 point line of the goalie doesnt lung at the disk a decent striker will almost always get it in.)\n\n-Perhaps give us a ranked mode? Right now match making is very meh. Some games youll be a lv 25 with all lv 40s and above bounce passing, re-grabbing, and spinning around like pros. The MMR system seems very loose to find quick games, but usually leads to more frustration when youre on unbalanced teams or just want to have fun.\n\n-Multiple save slots? Since the base quest, without third party software, does not have a permit multiple profiles, there is only one echo save per account. This leads to multiple people in a house hold having the same progression, leading to new players having inflated levels while on a shared quest, potentially putting them in less then desirable rounds.\n\n\nOver All?\nThis game definitely has a bright future! Great competitive gameplay, fun zero-g environment, and snappy mechanics and physics that feel fantastic. Yet, even though it is a beta, there are a lot of issues to iron out. The exploits rule the game, defense is an uphill battle (leading to one guy being able to single handily score and evade the other players), and the community sometimes makes it hard to come back. Yet it is still somehow my favorite game on the quest. I will be back tomorrow, and hopefully every day after that!

Doesnt feel natural like everything else.\n\nOther than that MINOR gripe, this game is great. I didnt get motion sick, its very smooth, and its fun.

Ever...\n\nRaised to 4* as I am much less being disconnected in the middle of a game. But it still happens, saying that my WiFi network is not available anymore (which is not the case). The ping seems to improve as well (I still have some games with around 200-300 ms ping, but I also have games with <50ms ping). And it's really a good XP, still not bored of it after hours of play. Pretty sure the final version will have a well deserved 5*!\n__________\n... when it works... Which is not often in my case. Ok, it's a beta, but out of 20 games, I was disconnected in the middle of the game for almost half of them. And when I'm not disconnected, I'm lucky if I have a ping of about 150ms (I have FTTH and have a real ping of 3 ms). Most of the time, my ping is more in the 500-750ms range (I'm in EU). Which lead to games where I'm ecstatic about an action, only to realize that this action only happened for me (like, I score, yay, but actually the game goes on because I didn't really score for the server).\nSo when a game runs fine, with an acceptable ping (in my case, below 200ms), it's absolutely fantastic. But that almost never happens... Hope the beta will improve, and that there will be EU servers soon, because the game is quite good!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Zata002May 7 at 6:54 AM\nAmazing\n\nEcho vr is super fun even without friends.

For me there is a learning curve I think. Figuring out the correct type of thrust or should I grab and push when heading towards the disk and situating myself. I probably just suck or need to stop pussyfooting around. The moment games get this innovative and intuitive, and we can push the growth of the VR community as a whole, we will skyrocket in improvement. And I think this game is a perfect example and entry into VR (I grew my VR legs so I don't know if people get motion sickness here). My only request is if you, the devs, complete the making of this game, and it's pay to play, that you leave a demo version, showing them the tutorial, and afterwards, throw them right into an AI fight, or something similar to give the newbies a taste.

The boosters dont stop you automatically (which the bot says they make you stop automatically) pressing the analog stick in to boost feels just so weird, the tutorial took longer because throwing the disk is much harder than it looks on video, near the end where you're supposed to throw it in the goal 3 times, it took me 10 or 15 times because I either missed or it bounced off the rim. Now, on to the tutorial i found the tutorial to be extremely long, helpful but long. I think I'd there were less parts in it like some unnecessary dialog and without \"ghosting players\" and the simulation it would be a much better tutorial. I've also found myself punching my floor and ceiling many times due to players or the disk being too high or too low, now I'm not blaming this on the game but I feel the thrusters should move you a little faster than they do now.

Terrible community.\n\nThis game is awesome. However, the community makes me not want to play it. Theres no obvious easy way to report all the toxic garbage. For a team game, communication is key. Screaming children and sexual assault on the field shouldnt be a thing. I should be able to easily report someone for being disgusting and dehumanizing. It shouldnt be hard, hidden, or difficult.\n\nThe gameplay is great and is fantastic fun, I just have to wade through all the toxic trash and garbage until I get high enough level that this isnt an issue (according to other reviews). I shouldnt have to do this, nor will I. Maybe Ill try the game again if they ever decide to put in some real functions to prevent being sexually harassed and assaulted while playing a game.

This game is more than top notch and is perfect in almost every way. There is not enough time to friend people at the end of the match, a suggestion i have is to add a feature that allows you to search players by their gamertag.

The Quest has many other great games but I was counting the days for this to come out. It's the ultimate quarantine/lockdown game because of how physical it is and how you can hang out with so many other people. The lobby is always filled with people amazed by zero gravity and trying things in it.\n\nWhen I went into the public area for the first time, someone was waiting by my pod and said \"Welcome to the future.\" It was unscripted, I swear, some kid was just waiting by the entrance saying that to people. That's how excited everyone is for this - players are, for free, with no pay, making sure you feel great playing it.\n\nMy other favorite video game is Rocket League, which is a lot like this because it's physics based and has a high skill ceiling, you can do almost anything you can imagine. This is the same way. Except, Rocket League has a lot of angry 25-year-old or so people, and they swear a lot and treat you badly if you do poorly. This game has a lot of younger people and it actually helps because they want to have fun and haven't gotten jaded on life yet.\n\nIf you want a nice clean game that isn't too 'tryhard' and stressful, this is really good at that, while SIMULTANEOUSLY also being an extremely challenging and awe-inspiring experience.

Almost everyone is super nice and will help you out with anything and you can make friends with them and play with them later. It sucks you cant add them in game and you have to it from the home menu but apart from that the friends system is great you can add people to your lobby and play with them in game and mess around with them in the lobby. Most people also have their mic on so its easy to communicate with people. However this game does have some flaws, it crashes a lot not enough that its unplayable but it does crash often maybe once and hour if I had to say an average. It also has this glitch sometimes where it goes all black and you can only see some objects but Im sure other people have had this issue and they are fixing it as Im writing this. But this is a beta so Im sure there are more bugs but they will fix them in the future. Overall the game is the most immersive experience Ive had on the quest and I think anyone who plays it will enjoy it. Its confusing because this is 0 gravity and you fly about you would think you would get motion sickness but I dont know what you done developers but I havent ran into anyone who got motion sick from it so well done.\n\nHelpful | 0", "waningeMay 6 at 3:01 AM\n\nI love this game alot even tho it is in beta it is amazing to play this helps me to do things instead of going out doors with covid19 out there thank you for creating this beta i wish that i could keep it when the full game is released for the last time thank you for creating this beta who ever the creator is\n\nHelpful | 0", "SfinkterUTMay 6 at 10:01 AM\nThis game is the best!\n\nWhen I got my quest I really wanted to play this game but to my disappointment its said coming soon.

This game is a competitive team-based multiplayer sport. It is much more different than other multiplayer games like Rec Room which dont offer enough complexity in any of the games. This is frantic, flying fun. Speaking of the flying; the movement is fantastic. The analog stick isnt used for movement and I think that makes the movement seem more natural and prevents motion sickness. Seriously, play this game at least once in your life!

I didnt even know it until seeing this game that real immersion is being able to float in zero G, to move in 3 dimensions. The full sense of truly being in the game was there like no other game: VR or flat.\nAdd in cleverly thought out motion rules like grabbing surfaces, just like being in the ISS would be like... its perfect in concept and execution.\n\nThat said, it lost me on the third game; not because of the game but the live players.\nAfter 2 fun, amazing games, the third one had a filthy mouthed, nasty person constantly swearing at our team mates (full complement of racist, ageist and sexist trash at full volume). There was no way to identify who on my team was this mental sewer, no way to block them, mute them. There was no way to even end the game except a full exit. What I want is to be able to identify a person like that and block or ban them from being joined up with me by the automatch algorithms.

I never had enough time to get across the room and into the tunnels before the countdown ran out. I'd rather respawn in the tunnel, ready to go. (Just my suggestions. It was frustrating)\n\nI'd also love a way to skip the gathering room and just drop into an arena. That just seems like a waste of time to have to navigate through there.\n\nWhen I was in the gathering room there was a group of kids who were 7-11 years old. Not your fault, but it was the typical pre-pubescent misuse of curse words trying to be cool. I would have loved a way to know which ones were talking so I could have muted them. I don't mind playing with kids, but the banter was a bit much. There were also some other people in there that I would not have minded listening to, but I didn't know how to tell who was who so I could mute the right person.\n\nI did not get sick in the game, however, I did feel a little weird when I took the headset off afterwards. It wasn't too bad. I'm just mentioning in case people might be prone to this,\n\nOverall, though, this is awesome. I'd like to spend a little time getting good at it to see if I can actually compete.\n\nHelpful | 0", "james.sturgeon.9465Jun 11 at 12:29 PM\nGreat game\n\nYou get to have fun of sneaking in up on players and grabbing them then punching them\n\nHelpful | 0", "LugnutBMay 5 at 8:39 PM\nBest VR Experience Ive Ever Had.\n\nIts exhilarating, immersive, fun, and simply unmatched.

Basically two teams try to throw a disc into the other teams goal. Whoever has more points when times up wins. The twist is you're in zero gravity and move with jets on your hands you can boost and brake by clicking in the analog stick. When fighting for the disc you can punch other players in the head to stun them or grab any part of there body and tackle them like a football player. This leads to some intense matches and it can be funny to grab people by the foot or butt and throw them back. People who complain about the grab feature should play another game like hyper dash (an awesome game as well but has no grabbing just shoot) as the grab is one of the best parts of echo vr. Great game my review would be 5 stars if the tutorial wasn't so long and patronizing it takes like 30-40min to slog through the boring tutorial. I learned more in my 1st match then I did the tutorials the tutorials need to be skippable or made more fun cause I could see alot of people getting a bad 1st impression and shutting the game off like i almost did seriously it is so slow.
