Im excited to see how it improved over time. This is the only app where it feels my headset is never quite in focus and its never centered. It always feels like my headset is on lopsided with one side further from my face than the other, so I need to turn my head 45 degrees to the right to feel balanced. The Focus experience is very short and I am constantly thrown off at the end with the bubbles of random pictures. I dont mind when its puppies, but I dont really care for the stock photos of families staring at me. But I do think I feel more productive afterwards.\n\nHelpful | 5", "Johnny_Moonlight2 days ago\nI like it but it needs a trip menu\n\nUPDATE:\nThere have been improvements in the app according to our feedback, which is appreciated (and sorry for my English, it's not my language). For example, now you can choose the duration of your Tripp.\nHowever, I still miss a MENU where you can choose among your favorite past trips, instead of being forced to choose the trip of the day ... It is the only missing piece for me to renew my annual subscription.\nAnyway, in my opinion this is a good app to relax with interesting surreal landscapes (except a couple of them that are a little bit cheesy). To the developers: thank you for your work.\nPS: I also miss an option to deactivate the circle that guides the breathing; for me, the \"visible breath\" is enough to know when to inhale and when to exhale.\n\nHelpful | 2", "atwbakerJul 5 at 12:06 AM\nPatronising and short & in-app trap\n\nBeware, even if you don't like it you CAN'T get your money back, they lock you in with an \"in-app\" purchase that doesn't qualify for a refund. I would suggest sticking with the demo until the devs add to the content improve matters.\n\nI tried, I really did, because I so wanted this to be good but....\n\nI'm starting to simply be irritated by it now, the sessions are too short, very similar each day and, worst of all, the \"affirmations\" in focus are a bit fortune cookie, patronising and random.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? We have no choice over them so can be irrelevant to our current situation (the affirmation a couple of days ago was for loss and gibberered on with some pap about grief) then they disappear the following day, so even the relevant ones cannot be driven home.\n\nSorry, I really wanted this and am probably more disappointed than the devs at reading this , I'd like my money back please but I can't have it because, as mentioned above, it's an \"in app purchase\"\n\nI've give 3 stars for potential and will update it and this review if/when appropriate , I think they're onto something here but it needs much more work.\n\nHelpful | 9\nDeveloper ResponseJul 29 at 10:03 AM\n\nDeveloper Update: July 2020 - Hi - We added the ability to expand the session length in our Calm experience and added deeper meditation content.

REALLY care about us, the end users. I know this because I have corresponded with them a few times, and they always show a level of care far beyond what you would expect. Even the CEO and I talked! That being said...\n\nI've never really had much of a high opinion of psychology in general, much less the ASMR/focused breathing stuff. Since my life has been (like many Americans and citizens of the world, I'm sure) somewhat tumultuous recently, I was looking for ways to try and unwind, reduce the mental burden on my physical body, and improve my overall wellness. My Aunt had suggested this and reluctantly I gave it a shot.\n\nI WAS BLOWN AWAY! EVERY TIME I went through an experience, I felt calmer, more at peace, more capable and able to handle the stresses of life. The science behind this stuff is very established, and TRIPP puts it into practice in a way that I've never even imagined before. I chose the woman's voice, and I'm always glad when she says enouraging things because I've always heard just the opposite from the people closest to me. My inner voice has always told me that I wasn't good enough, I don't have what it takes, I'll fail - in doing just a FEW EXPERIENCES in TRIPP, I've found that none of that is true. And it's not all touchy-feely, campfires, and patchouli stuff, either. This is REAL SCIENCE.\n\nI have never done the same experience twice. In other words I NEVER SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING REPETITIVE! That is HUGE.\n\nThank you so much to the folks at Tripp, inc. You guys are really helping me through a tough time, and more than that, you're helping VR to become more than just another \"nintendo\" type console. YOU guys are ensuring and demonstrating that it is a viable option and effective tool for psychological exercises and improvement of mental well-being.\n\nA suggestion or two - Maybe instead of requiring no controllers be used in the menus, allow us to use them and then eliminate them during the actual exercise/experience? And what about in the first few minutes of each experience a little bit of guidance telling us that the first couple of minutes are just for our centering and focus? Just some thoughts.\n\nAgain, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!!\n\nDave Stanley, Denver, CO\n\nHelpful | 3", "RobbDe12321 days ago\nCool...but really? A subscription? Nah.\n\nThe free run was cool(although not much replay value)....but I don't need another subscription. Shoulda just charged an outright cost for the app/game itself, instead of going the subscription route.\nThat said, I wouldn't pay any more than $15 for this app....maybe $10.\n...and that's based on what I've heard from others who have paid for the subscription.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper Response14 days ago\n\nHi!

We have been working hard to increase our catalog as well as continue to improve the quality of the experience. Wishing you all the best.", "TheForbinProjectApr 26 at 5:59 PM\nIn-Depth Review From a Subscriber\n\nI do like this product, but with some caveats. If you can get an annual subscription for $20 (or less), Tripp is worth it. There is currently not enough content or quality to warrant a higher price.\n\nThe core of the program are 2.5 meditation options. 1 for Focus and 1.5 for Calm. Both last ~8 minutes and consist of 3 scenes, 2 of which have breathing exercises and an outro which is just a visual. Narration can be switched off. The main difference between Focus and Calm is the inclusion of a mini-game (which NEVER changes) where you guide an avatar with your gaze to collect coins. Only Focus has this \"game;\" Calm scenarios omit it.\n\nCalm is split into 2 options--one for Relaxation and one for Sleep Preparation. They are always the exact same experience, with Sleep Preparation only differentiated by (supposed) binaural audio to promote sleep.\n\nI use the program nightly and find it beneficial. Because the scenarios are fairly short, I normally begin by doing Focus and then Calm (Sleep Preparation). I wish there were options for longer meditation randomized visuals. I often just switch to the free Cosmic Flow app (via SideQuest) which provides an outstanding alternative.\n\nVisuals in Tripp are sufficient but not great. The developers seem to re-use a limited number of assets to create the visuals, and it gets really repetitive. Quest is capable of far better graphics and these are of middling quality at best. The devs have ignored feedback in reviews complaining about the inclusion of jarring stock photos used in every Focus session. You can change these by uploading personal photos but it is still horrible and developers ignoring feedback isn't good. Also, each Calm session ends with the same HORRIBLE graphic of Earth. It looks like garbage and ruins the experience for me.\n\nHelpful | 189\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 1:33 PM\n\nHello! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback to our team... We took your comments to heart and have made the following changes: - ability to turn off the photos in the settings menu - Variable endings to the Calm TRIPP that replace the Earth image - A new game for Focus in finalization to launch soon with more to come - the ability to extend your session length for Calm that will launch in our next update - improved visual quality and variability - We are working on a separate Sleep TRIPP and more changes to come We appreciate you and wish you all the best. Please check in with us for more updates as we continue to evolve and improve our offering.

I'm confused because in some of the reviews the developers say they might offer an option to pay for the app and have that be your payment for the subscription. What did I pay for?

I was very skeptical about getting it because there are so many \"mindfulness\" programs out there these days, but I figured I'd give it a shot cause it was free. I ended up loving it so much on the first try that I bought the lifetime subscription (which is only $23!) It is so immersive, the lady's voice is extremely soothing, and the guidance offered during each session is down-to-earth, profound, and insightful. If you're on the fence about trying it, just try it.\n\nHelpful | 2", "gamez-on12 days ago\nRepetitive\n\nI agree with other reviewers. The potential is there but both focus and calm are repetitive and because of that I find the boredom to be a distraction from the messages and breathing. I did invest in a year subscription but have some regrets about doing so after using it for about a month.\n\nHelpful | 1", "sillydogeballJun 13 at 9:18 PM\nGosh, I love this concept\n\nTripp is a delightful journey into a calm place for me. The breathing areas really do bring me where I need to be in order to relax. As others have pointed out, with the focus Tripps, theres a real cheesy factor with the pups and kitties. Im a fan of both, but it took me out of the grand finale. And when adding my own generic images, they only seemed to work sometimes.\n\nHowever, this isnt a factor in the sleep preparedness section, and Tripp has really gotten that down beautifully. My only qualm would be Id love to choose the scene. There were some underwater Tripps that I didnt personally like because of a phobia. I managed to get through them, but I would have loved the option of choosing our own surroundings.\n\nI hope this review is helpful to others. This was what I needed. I meditate outside the Quest, but theres something special about it when youre in the fantasy land of VR.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper ResponseJun 14 at 2:03 PM\n\nWonderful input and we are working on an update that will allow you to have more control over the worldscapes you experience. stay tuned!

Thank you for your patience and we are sure we can make this work for you.", "LinguaProfJul 16 at 11:58 AM\nAn amazing, out-of-body experience\n\nMy husband and I use this app daily. As a matter of fact, my husband was using my Oculus Quest to access this app so often that I finally purchased him his own Quest and registered him for the app. Now he uses it as part of his wind-down routine, sitting in a massage chair and clearing his mind with TRIPP. He is a restaurant manager in the time of COVID-19 so he comes home pretty rattled. This is an amazing antidote!\n\nWhen you start out in the app, you can choose between Focus (to get your day started) or Calm (and within calm you can choose Sleep Preparation or Deep Relaxation). The formula for both is almost the same, except in Calm you do a bit more deep breathing. As you breathe in, you have a visual not only of a circle that guides you how long to breathe in, how long to hold it, how long to exhale and then hold again, but there are stars that are aimed right for your nostrils as you breathe in and different colored stars as you exhale. It truly makes it a cosmic experience.\n\nMy favorite part of the program is much too short. After deep breathing, you rise above the scenery, shaking off the stress of the day. As you rise into the air and watch the scenery descend below you, its nearly a physical sensation of an out-of-body experience. However, it only lasts about five seconds. This part should really be longer and more immersive!\n\nI also wish that there were more reminders to keep your mind on your deep breathing, bringing you back to your meditation. Sometimes I get distracted by the kaleidoscope visions, so I have taken to focusing on one spot in the center of the scene to concentrate more on my breathing. At the end of the Calm meditations you see a picture of the earth as if you were floating in space. I am not crazy about this view, so I have learned to close my eyes when its about to appear. You rate your mood at the beginning and the end, and my moods have elevated each time.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 9:00 AM\n\nHi! Thank you for your feedback.

The actual Tripp Calm and Focus meditations are the exact same as the demo- the lady talks you through some simple breathing exercises, you go down the little psychedelic tunnel thing, you play the little game with the cube and touch the coins, then into the open space with pictures of animals and babies and stuff then three long breaths and that's it. I was hoping the full version would come with a more lengthy and intensive meditations but it's the same little journey again and again, just with different scenery and colors. It's short and it gets repetitive pretty quickly, at least for me. Other than that there are some 360 videos of nature and a few other videos but I'm not the biggest fan of 360 videos because they always look so grainy.\n\nSo yeah, do the 7 day free trial before you potentially waste your money because there are no refunds.\n\nTwo stars instead of one because it's a cool idea and I did buy the lifetime subscription so it's got potential to improve and I'm sure it will (I will change my rating as my opinion changes) but as of right now I feel it's pretty lacking. If all you want is to do the same little 8 minute meditation trance trip head cube moving coin grabbing baby/animal seeing breathing at the start and the end then this is the app for you.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response24 days ago\n\nHi!

I had hoped that Tripp would give me a hi-tech experience of the peace and slow-down that I experience with my 30-minute meditation. I like the kaleidoscopic tunnel effect and I like the opening screen with the calm water around me. But the high-colour journey is, if anything, distracting from what Id want from an app like this. Its not soothing. I understand the repetitive nature of the journey you take each time you use the app. However the graphic quality creates shimmery edges to many of the scenes and this, in itself, is a distraction. There just seems to be too much going on, its stimulating my brain rather than pacifying it. There is a nice graphic for breathing but its too short and therefore not beneficial. A breathing exercise should very slowly and imperceptibly slow down your breathing over 10 or 15 minutes, not 2.\n\nI would like Tripp to allow me huge VR spaces with minimal distraction. A dark water-cave bathed in deep crimson light with slowly-evolving ripples would be worthy of my subscription. Right now its too much a game and too little a viable therapy.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 1:07 PM\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback.

It lacks languages, which makes it difficult for non-english speakers to comprehend.\n\nHelpful | 0", "automatticcMay 21 at 7:04 PM\nSolid concept but room for improvement\n\nI LOVE the concept of this thing. It definitely does a good job in capturing my attention and directing me through a series of guided visual experiences. Straight up as of right now for the price you pay I believe a little more could be put into the app. It has an awesome concept and has a LOT of potential. I feel like it needs more programs though honestly. I really hope they are going to add more programs and stuff because I see a lot of potential that is there, could be a leading game on the market, and it can truly give you a full blown biofeedback and meditative experience that people pay a lot of money for to go to a professional or doctor or yogi.\n\nThe guided visual biofeedback like game where you use the center of your headset to steer through obstacles is cool but thats the only one I believe; needs more diversity. Its all kind of the same. I can tell they use repeating templates and graphics in all the visuals and the graphics could be improved. Ive seen pretty good graphics on the quest and know it could be improved. Different levels, different situations, maybe different levels of difficulty or experienced or novice, different games, different ways to capture your attention and really keep you captivated. I can tell after doing this same thing over and over for a month I will probably get tired of it and want more. I was ready to spend an hour on this and fully focus on a long meditative experience but I didnt find that. Obviously this doesnt mean that any of this wont happen in the future. Just as of now its not there and I hope the developers see all this feedback a few of us have left and hear us and actually take it and run with it because this app has such potential and I will DEFINITELY be here every step of the way as they progress with their add ones and improvements.\n\nI would love to see a whole library of stuff to do to expand the mind and expand my awareness and simply just keep me focused and out of my head and thoughts for hours. Super important for us all to do and I hope this will be a possibility in the near future. More biofeedback like programs/games so you can focus and not let your mind wander.\n\nALSO, really important one I think. I dont know if this is possible but somehow set an options menu to where you could configure what your posture is and the app accommodates for it. Because I found myself wanting to lie down or even just sit on my couch and lean back and rest my head on the pillow. One thing Ive learned from meditating for so long is that when you kill your muscles and sink really deep into the cushions on whole youre laying on the bed, it allows you to be so much more immersed into your meditation and really fall into those deep brain wave states. Especially for new people.\n\nAnyways..app is cool, but for the price it definitely needs more stuff added. I bought the app and Im already done in one night. A library of options and material with tons of games and biofeedback stuff would be a five star review hands down. Hopefully this comes in the near future. I e read some of the other comments and apparently everyone feels the same on most things.

You can find this in the app.\n\nAs someone who never seriously tried meditation before and couldn't sit still for the required amount of time this app really has helped me to put small relaxing breaks into my day. The visuals are trippy and just distracting enough to take my mind off things, and seeing my pictures at the end always brings a smile to my face and reminds me of the good things I have even on a bad day.\n\nThere's a few things I'd improve to get this to five stars:\n\n- I wish I could stay in a scene as long as I want. Right now, even if you do not look into the light to go further it will automatically progress after a few extra breath cycles. I wish I could just stay until I choose to go on.\n- When I turn of voice instructions in the \"Calm\" portion of the app there's no voice at all, so it is also missing the affirmations. It would be better if you could turn off the breathing instructions and still hear the other parts like you can in \"Focus\"\n- In the part where you collect the coins you are not supposed to look around, or your fish, balloon, kite etc. will bump into a wall. This would be fine if the walls wouldn't be really ugly and red. I'd just make them invisible.\n- Right after collecting the coins when entering the kaleidoscope tunnel the environment you are in changes very abruptly. It's slightly obscured by the tunnel, but once I saw it I can not help to notice this happening. If it would fade in and out it would be much more pleasant!\n- An option to exclude a Tripp if you happen to come across one that you really don't like would be awesome.\n\nAside from these points I'm very happy with it and use it daily! The Devs also have been updating with videos and a new mode called \"Lumen\", which is a more interactive version of the Tripp experience in which you can grow trees and plants.\n\nHelpful | 6\nDeveloper ResponseMay 4 at 4:20 PM\n\nThese are great notes, PawPawKitty and we are working on some of your suggestions now!

I enjoy they are different every day because I always want to get different perspectives each day. Im always curious what the day will cover. I usually only do the sessions at night. I do focus then the bedtime one. That always works best. I process things better visually so seeing the inhale and exhale clicks for me in my brain. Its easier to do it when I picture it or see it. It calms me down and makes me feel less anxious.\n\nWhen I first got it, I didnt really like the speakers voices but they grew on me. Now I love having the voice on even when I do it everyday and dont need the guidance. I have so many thoughts sometimes its just comforting to hear some of the words out loud.\n\nAs much as I love it, I know there are a few things the app can improve on. I think If the graphics got upgraded this app can truly be magical. Its not bad now but I think if some of theses scenes were updated it would be mind blowing. Like the moments where you float up or through space. The space scenes. The graphics are beautiful but if improved can really enhance the experience.\n\nAnother thing that would be cool would be an option to favorite some Tripps to replay. Some days its more helpful to hear certain ones and it could be someones own personal therapy.\n\nAlso, I know they are designed to not take up a whole lot of time but an option for longer Tripps would be great too. Doesnt have to be packed with content. Just the option to hang out a little longer in the worlds and meditate and destress.\n\nIts not perfect but it helps me.

Tried the demo then purchased the lifetime subscription. Theyre having a coronavirus special.\n\nIf you like mindfulness and inspirational speakers like Eckhart Tolle, Marianne Williamson, Louise Hay and others, you should love this. Their podcasts usually begin with breathing exercises. Ill eventually add my own photos later. But now, I love the pictures of the dogs theyve included at the end.\n\nI must add that I LOVE kaleidoscopes. Thats what drew me in. The kaleidoscope pulls you in, creating the meditation experience.

This totally jarred me out of the experience, and broke all immersion. I especially don't find pictures of babies to be peaceful or relaxing, and the whole situation seemed oddly out of place and inconsistent in an otherwise cool environment. I would definitely consider subscribing if I wasn't forced to see cheesy generic \"happy\" pics at the end of every session.\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper ResponseMar 2 at 12:09 PM\n\nHi, Subscribers can upload their own images to replace those \"cheesy generic happy pics\" in the demo. It really makes a difference to see your own images in there. We recommend uploading more than 20 photos for the full effect.

After using for a few days the setup of the nee content was the same experience, with a different skin. Would have liked some variety to the paths that are taken. Ended up cancelling my subscription before the trial date. If there was more variety I would be more inclined to keep up with the experience.\n\nHelpful | 10", "rychappellJan 1 at 6:41 AM\nHas potential, but not there yet.\n\nI signed up for the annual subscription ($30), since I'm more motivated to meditate when I can do it in VR. That said, I think most people would be better off with Headspace, since the quality of these guided meditations does not seem as high. It's mostly just breathing exercises (with nice visual breath effects for you to time your inhales & exhales with) and a bunch of filler. The daily \"updates\" change the background scenery and a couple of sentences of filler material. I don't see enough substance here to really justify a subscription model for most users.\n\nWHAT'S GOOD:\n* Breathing exercises with nice visual breath effects\n* Ascending up into the air afterwards is another nice use of VR visuals.\n* Ability to customize the final section of the 'focus' sessions with your own photos (that appear on giant floating ornaments in place of stock photos of babies and pets) is a nice touch.\n\nSUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:\n\n* More customization needed. Half the time the daily \"theme\" isn't relevant to me. And some background visuals are more appealing than others. So it'd be helpful to have ACCESS TO THE BACK-CATALOG of past meditations to be able to choose from, for better personalization.\n\n* Offer the option of more in-depth guided meditations, a la headspace, e.g. starting with focused breathing and then slowly walking the user through a full body scan. This could take up the full 7 - 8 minutes, and that could be much more valuable for some users than forcing us to just go through three different 2-minute mini-modules in sequence, the way it seems to work now.\n\n* Improve graphics quality (e.g. anti-aliasing): Some of the graphics are lovely, and others are a distracting mess. Please fix the latter. For example: Broken, jagged lines on the loading bar, or the Earth's circumference, create a cheap, amateurish feel. Some basic anti-aliasing would go a *long* way here!\n\n* Consider replacing subscription model with a DLC model to unlock extra meditations for $$.\n\nHelpful | 128", "mrswannyFeb 21 at 2:20 PM\nI did the yearly subscription!\n\nI tried the demo and I was very calm and relaxed afterwards.

The meditation narrator was a calming female voice which was relaxing along with the visuals. I did some exploring and there's also a 7-day free trial. After that there is a $5/mo subscription option if someone is into using their Quest for visual meditation.\n\nThere are no controllers, so selections are made by just the headset which is okay since they are just 7-8 minute per day meditation sessions. Definitely not subscribing right away, but I will do the free trial to see if there is more to it and update this review.\n\nHelpful | 229\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 1:34 PM\n\nHi!

I got your app update today, and I was thrilled to see that you were offering me the requested option to purchase your product from the Oculus store. Great option, great price! Take my money, right here, right now...oops, whats this? You want me to make a separate account on your website? I need to give you my email address? Make yet another stupid password to remember? Grrrrrrr....fine...click.... Whoops, now you want my name? Location? Birthday? Etc....\n\nNo. No. No.\n\nObviously you just dont get it. I will NOT do that. Why would anybody do that? If you would politely ask me to complete an OPTIONAL survey within the app, in order to help your database or to enhance MY experience I would certainly consider it. AFTER my purchase, not before. Your zeal for data mining is hindering your sales efforts. If you want me to buy your product, stop trying to FORCE me to do things outside of the Oculus platform.\n\n*** Rating reduced to a 1 Star\n\n\n-\n\nOriginal Review\n\nThis app is trailblazing into an area that could potentially be of great value to the human experience. Yes, I think its THAT big of a deal. Using VR to enhance & expand consciousness is a profound use of this new tech, and this app is the best Ive seen.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThe decision to make this a subscription based purchase is a BIG mistake. (IMHO) After downloading the app on my Quest, and experiencing the short demo, I was ready to hit that purchase button right then & there. Oops, cant buy it on my Quest :(\n\nIn order to purchase, I am directed to go to an external website, which means I have to take off my Quest and fire up my pc. Hassle. Impulse purchase: deflated. Then, I have to get out my CC and make a subscription based purchase to a company Ive never heard of before. Nope. Sorry, I think you are making me jump through unnecessary hoops that trigger my scam radar. Im not saying this is a scam, I am saying that unfortunately your choice of payment method/options is cumbersome and discouraging. Why cant I just click on the purchase button in the Quest store, like I have with EVERY OTHER APP I PURCHASED ON THE QUEST? Make your app a 1 time purchase, and offer additional paid DLC for future revenue streams. I feel you may be sacrificing immediate sales, for hopes of long term revenue streams that may not occur due to too much friction involved with your subscription paradigm.\n\nI am going to purchase your app, regardless of what I have stated above, because it is well worth it. I hope my honest impressions of your payment methods has not offended. My critique is given in hopes that your app receives all the attention & success it deserves. Its excellent.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseApr 8 at 9:55 AM\n\nHi Curtrock, TRIPP is run by a small team of devs that are passionate about creating beneficial immersive experiences. Your opinion definitely means a lot to us. We heard you loud and clear on your original review to create a Lifetime Purchase option and have addressed that. We also looked at how we could price it in a way that could help people during this time -- even though it is challenging for us as a small company to do this. FWIW, The account creation for us is less about data mining but more about connecting the TRIPP VR and Mobile apps so that the experiences can be personalized with your own images. We are also working on expanding our mood profiling for you to be able to track progress over time in the mobile app. We can definitely do a MUCH BETTER job at communicating WHY having a TRIPP account is needed. We will also take your feedback to heart and look at different flow options that could improve the user experience. Feel free to continue to let us know how you feel. Emailing support@tripp.com will reach everyone in our company. Having direct interaction with our customers on how we can be better is extremely important to us at this early stage in our journey. You and your voice is a big part of that.

Ive been Tripping every morning (focus) and every night (sleep preparation) for a month now. Focus is a great way to get started on my morning meditation, and the sleep preparation is so effective I once fell asleep with my headset on. (Neck hurt like hell the following day. I like the extras you are adding. Well, not so much for Lumen. But the other one is great. How about a meditation scene where we are surrounded by Tibetan monks chanting? Or in the Amazon in the midst of the Shipibos holding an ayahuasca ceremony? You have all these mushrooms. How about a magical forest meditation where it is like a psilocybin experience? Your kaleidoscope tunnel reminds me of a dmt experience. As far as the customization, I would like to be able to choose from several different voices and accents for the voice-over.

Its immersive and perfect for those whose minds wander and have trouble truly relaxing. Its beautifully created with incredible graphics and a pleasant voice to guide you through the experience. Overall, I LOVE this app. My problem however stems from the payment option.\n\nAs other reviews have pointed out, making this a subscription was a very big mistake. When opening the app, youre brought to a page where you can either go through the demo or log into an account. An account that has to be set up outside of VR and paid for outside of the oculus store. This is a problem for several reasons. People are less likely to take off the headset and interrupt the immersion to go to a website and sign up. Further, signing up for a service outside of the oculus store for a relatively unknown app makes people feel more cautious.\n\nFor these reasons, I wont be purchasing until a different payment structure is put in place. Im not saying get rid of the subscription option, but perhaps consider adding DLC for those who dont want (or are not comfortable with) a subscription service. In the meantime, Ill continue enjoying the demo of this app. It truly is incredible and I would LOVE to throw my money in to support the devs... but not until other payment options are available.\n\nHelpful | 19\nDeveloper ResponseJan 26 at 10:23 PM\n\nHello, Thank you for taking the time to tell us how you feel.

Ive tried a number of these types of app on the Oculus Go but this is the first Ive seen on the Quest and it definitely takes advantage of the improved specs. For some reason, until the recent update, I appear to have had access to the full subscription version for a month and as far as I could see the daily update was no more than a few colours changing here and there. Having your own pictures in the bubbles is a nice touch but not worth $5 a month, I would, however pay an in-app purchase to unlock and think this would be a better model than subscription.

Even though I have uploaded a dozen photos of my own, the occasional random photo of children still pops up in the app but I just focus on the ones I uploaded.\n\nI have to admit I am very impressed how quickly the developer responded and have decided to take their advice and sent an email to see what they can do about the US exchange rate. Normally, I wouldn't care and just uninstall, then move on but TRIPP is really helping me!

In my opinion it doesn't justify a subscription model in it's current state though. That's why i won't subscribe. My main problems are...\n\n- Thin Content & Variety\nIt feels thin even within the free trial. It feels as if the levels are randomly generated (even if they're not) and with exception to minor details the excercises are too similar for my taste. I don't think i need to subscribe for basically breath exercises which i can do with free ASMR videos when getting to sleep. Little disappointed that \"daily updates\" mostly mean different backgrounds.\n\n- Basically no Guidance\nThe similarity of all those excerices also makes the voice guidance irrelevant for more experienced users. Therefore the option to turn them off. But i'd like the guidance if it were more diversified and something to think about. Something i expected when i started the free trial because i thought the subscription would include that. I mean, they're soothing voices, perfect for giving guidance while relaxing. Please use them.\n\n- Graphics\nNeed to be improved in terms of anti-aliasing. In some instances the low resolution objects can be quite distracting. But i think there are other possibilites to conceal those problems other than doing a whole graphics update. Maybe place gigantic illuminated and seemingly flickering pillars more far away and make them not that shiny.\n\nSo for me it's a nice proof of concept but even the subscription feels like a demo. Yes, meditating is not about complexity and stuff. BUT there are more ways to meditate as free guided meditations, ASMR videos and so on prove on Youtube. I feel i get the same expericence when watching a 360-VR-Video with soothing background music while doing breath excercies without (the very cool) effects myself.\n\nMy conclusion is, I'd need more guidance, diverse excercises for different moods and a more clever use of the limited graphics to subscribe...\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJan 7 at 7:08 PM\n\nThank you for your feedback!

Never thought meditation would work in VR as I've tried other experiences on the Oculus Go. TRIPP is a game changer for meditation. After my meditation session I definitely felt calmer, focused and astonished. The visuals are gorgeous and make you feel as if you're in a peaceful hallucination. The voice guiding you is extremely comforting. The whole experience is extremely immersive.Not a huge fan of subscription plans but the pricing is actually modest for frequently updated content @4.99/mo or 29.99/yr. All in all im very impressed with the experience and could see myself using this daily.\n\nUpdate-\n\nI've truly enjoyed using TRIPP over the past weeks. Although I love what I've experienced so far I still think there is room for improvement. Here are some of my thoughts for the development team-\n\n-Rather than use a daily meditation that updates instead give a catalogue of experiences to choose from and download for offline viewing.\n\n-Increase the length of experiences. After a meditation I find myself going back for another session or two. Rather than breaking immersion going back to the main menu it would be nice to just have one long meditation (15-30 minutes).\n\n- I find the picture bubbles at the tail end of a session unneccessary and distracting. Perhaps give an option to toggle off or remove them?\n\n- Overall im pleased with the graphics but I do feel some environmental elements can be smoothed out.\n\n- Reconsider your price model. This seems to be the number one complaint I see in other reviews. Personally I dont mind the subscription plan but if I had to choose between a plan or one time purchase it would def be the latter.\n\nAll in all I'm still very satisfied with my experience so far and excited to see how TRIPP grows from here. Keep up the good work!\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJan 17 at 10:15 PM\n\nThank you for your support and understanding as we evolve our offering! Your feedback is great. The bubbles at the end can be personalized through the mobile app and it is a very deeply connecting feature when you take the time to add your own images. We have had users do incredibly creative things with this feature -- Users upload people and images of things they are grateful for. Others have used this feature like a vision board to set intentions for things they want to bring into their lives or attributes they want to develop. Our favorite is a user who is struggling with a chronic illness and he uploads images of himself when he was healthy to remind himself that he is not his illness. Please try it out and let us know if that makes the feature better for you. It works best with at least 30-40 images uploaded so you get a nice surprise based on who or what shows up in your TRIPP. Adding a feature to turn them off is also something we will look at. This can be done with the mood profiling (we use to train AI) in the settings menu. (Another user request that was LOUD and heard.) Thank you again for all of your encouragement and support!", "HeavenlyDylanJan 30 at 4:19 PM\nAmazing idea.

I really like the idea and can feel someone's making wise decisions and the app is being tested. But the image quality needs a lot of work. Compression artifacts, and banding in skybox and textures are not pretty and relatively easy to fix. Sprites should point to camera position and not be locked to head rotation.\nThe breathing particles were my favorite thing and really clever but they also lacked some polish.\nAlso you can change render resolution depending on the scene and fixed foveated rendering every frame , seeing lots of aliasing on the loading screen and almost empty scenes is unnecessary and makes it seem unpolished even with good content.\nSorry for the rant, but there's a lot of potential.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseDec 25 at 4:25 PM\n\nThank you for your input.

Though there was a nice water reflection effect. And the aesthetic is distractingly kitcsh, the animation I saw had spherical-mapped images of stock-photos of babies and kittens.\n\nTheres a voice occasionally that seems to be pieces of a guided meditation, but its cut up randomly, seems to be missing pieces important for context, and is interspersed with games youre supposed to engage with, so none of that aspect makes any sense. In theory I could imagine some activity coupled with meditation working (think listening to a voice while the whole time chopping an endless pile of wood, raking a pebble garden, or walking in a forest). But certainly not pausing breathing exercises to dodge obstacles and collect coins in a 3D tunnel, which is what I had.\n\n(This free app tries to sell you a paid subscription to new content, so really its a demo, though thats fine)\n\nTo the app makers: Heres my 2c: you need to build a relaxing space, reduce distraction, and get a proper guided meditation recording if thats your aim and business model.

At the end of the day I just happened to stumble on this app. I went through the demo and I immediately felt much better. I got to a place where I realized how absurd it is to get upset with work related things when there is so much more in life.\n\nI also got my teenage daughter to try it out, and she was visibly more relaxed after going through one session. She said the she feels amazing after going through it.\n\nThank you for making this work of art. Amazing. The perfect medium for this sort of thing, with a great execution.\n\nWorth every penny.\n\nIf I were to ask for one feature, it is to experience previous sessions for relaxation and focus (I dont know if you cycle through a set of experiences. If thats the case, dont worry about about it, but if they are different every day, it will be great to go back to experience sessions from previous days).\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseApr 23 at 4:46 PM\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you!

After researching this development team, you can tell they put their heart and soul into this app. I really dont understand why people complain about this being a demo. The description clearly states what it is. The free demo is about 7-8 mins long. Its very well done and I felt great after. Not sure why people gave negative reviews on this being a subscription based app. Its actually an amazing deal. 29.99 for a year! It updates DAILY.

This is always going to be a major stumbling block with this incredibly promising aspect of VR  meditation, and more broadly, biofeedback. The developers have done an excellent job here, given current constraints, and this app demonstrates just how powerful this technology is going to be. I will definitely support this project through subscription, and I look forward to seeing where the developers take it. it is obviously a work in progress; but then, that applies to almost all VR right now, it is very early days. I would like the developers of this app to consider incorporating brainwave entrainment technology into this format  for example, hemisync, and approaches like that. I like that this app only relies on head movement for this example, but it seems clear that highly interactive formats could also be developed that may well be equally powerful. Interesting times, and this is very promising indeed.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJan 15 at 10:44 PM\n\nThank you so much for understanding that we are working hard to evolve our offering and your supportive attitude is very much appreciated by our entire team.
