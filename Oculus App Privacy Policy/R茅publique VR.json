THE CAMOUFLAJ ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE GAME, THE SERVICE, AND MATERIALS, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE CAMOUFLAJ ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE GAME, SERVICE, OR MATERIALS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.\n\nYOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE GAME, THE SERVICE, AND MATERIALS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT YOU USE THE GAME, THE SERVICE, AND MATERIALS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY BODILY HARM, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.\n\n11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE CAMOUFLAJ ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE GAME, THE SERVICE, AND MATERIALS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY CAMOUFLAJ ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.\n\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CAMOUFLAJ ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE GAME, THE SERVICE, THE MATERIALS, OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS EULA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO $100.\n\nEACH PROVISION OF THIS EULA THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS EULA BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n12. INTERNATIONAL USE.\n\nThe Service is controlled and operated from within the United States. Camouflaj makes no representation that the Service (including the Game) is appropriate or available in locations outside the United States. Those who choose to access the Service (including the Game) from other locations are responsible for compliance with applicable laws. All users must comply with all applicable law, and any software made available in connection with the Service and the transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States and other applicable export controls.\n\n13. GOVERNING LAW.\n\nThis EULA is governed by the laws of Washington without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under this EULA, then you and Camouflaj agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating any dispute.\n\n14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION.\n\n14.1 Generally.\n\nIn the interest of resolving disputes between you and Camouflaj in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Camouflaj agree that every dispute arising in connection with this EULA will be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND CAMOUFLAJ ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n14.2 Exceptions.\n\nDespite the provisions of Section 14.1, we both agree that nothing in this EULA will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\n14.3 Arbitrator.\n\nAny arbitration between you and Camouflaj will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Camouflaj.\n\n14.4 Notice; Process.\n\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\"). Camouflajs address for Notice is: Camouflaj, 110 110th AVE NE STE 350, Bellevue WA 98004. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Camouflaj may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Camouflaj must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Camouflaj will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Camouflaj in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrators award; or (iii) $1,000.\n\n14.5 Fees.\n\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, Camouflaj will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Camouflaj for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrators ruling on the merits.\n\n14.6 No Class Actions.\n\nYOU AND CAMOUFLAJ AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Camouflaj agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\n14.7 Modifications\n\nIf Camouflaj makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Camouflajs address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Camouflajs address for Notice, in which case your account with Camouflaj will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.\n\n14.8 Enforceability\n\nIf Section 14.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.\n\n15. GENERAL.\n\nThis EULA, together with the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Camouflaj regarding your use of the Service (including the Game). Except as expressly permitted above, this EULA may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to this EULA. You may not assign or transfer this EULA or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign this EULA at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this EULA, or any provision of this EULA, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in this EULA is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of this EULA is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\n\n16. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.\n\nThe Game and/or Service may include open source software or third-party software. Any such software is made available to you under the terms of the applicable licenses.\n\n17. CONTACT INFORMATION.\n\nCamouflaj, LLC is located at 110 110th AVE NE, STE 350, Bellevue WA 98004.

I was truely desperate and frustrated until I got back in may and slightly began to understand the gameplay. And the more I get into the story the more I am astonished by the gameplay, storytelling , and puzzles are pretty enjoyable to. I am not yet finished , already in the beginning of level 4 and pretty sure when Ill reach the end Ill try again with other profiles . Congratulations to the developers team it is a masterpiece\n\nHelpful | 22", "TeonisJul 14 at 12:08 AM\nA pretty good stealth game\n\nI was not disappointed. I started to play this on my smartphone, but never finished it. It was a great game on mobile, and an excellent experience in VR. The gameplay is great, the stealth part is working, the story is deep, has a ton of collectible background info. The actors (David Hayter!!!) are really good.\n\nI can only recommend this game! Not for everyone, but give it a try!\n\nHelpful | 4", "FatSheamusMay 15 at 10:43 PM\nPretty but...\n\nHonestly I grew entirely bored after about an hour of gameplay. Maybe it was the subject matter, maybe it was the slightly convoluted plot and drab characters. Whichever the case, I just wasn't thrilled with how it all played out.\nI don't know, maybe its just me.\n\nHelpful | 34", "Golden_MindMay 23 at 6:26 AM\nThere is hope?\n\nOriginally dubious about playing a game where you do nothing except guide someone.\n\nOh but you mentally guide them, you care for them and you fear for them.\n\nThere are moment when you have to strategise and plan your move really carefully, one wrong move and back to the confinement room.\n\nEither standing or sitting but very little movement apart from pointing and turning your head.\n\nIt's absorbing of time.\n\nWonderful storyline, the ending is lacking a bit of hope but, she wants to be free.\n\nFinal thoughts.. strategically tough but an ending of hope.\n\nWorth more than 10.99.\n\nHelpful | 9", "Faye32620 days ago\nFun and Addictive\n\nUpdate: Pretty cool game. Not sure if I cared for the ending. Hope more games are created like this one, Fun and lengthy.\nI really enjoy this game. Took me a while to get pass episode 1, but once i did, I started rolling.

Waited months for each chapter to come out. I even bought an IPad with more space just so I had enough space for each chapter as they came out. Im definitely a fan. I was not disappointed when I bought and played this game on VR. Visually its so much more in depth than on the IPad. You can immerse yourself for hours just playing and really following the story. Each time I play it I challenge myself to do something like pickpocket every Prizraak or find every tape etc. The devs really did put a lot into this game and it shows. Ive not had any issues with crashing or losing my game on the Quest. You can play this sitting the whole time if you choose. I do recommend this game and Id definitely buy another Camouflaj title.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Vladtheimpaler6911May 23 at 3:38 AM\nRepublique VR\n\nI enjoy playing the game. I found it interesting.

This was a interesting story line. I thought the game play was really good. Puzzles were good. Overall this game is now in my top 5. Thanks for a longer game play!

I don't care if the game is decent, if it does not cast I will give it 1 star and advise all against it, vr is mostly a solo experience that will remain in the dark to alot of people due to this selfish constraint, the ability to cast can bring a game to a group experience and allow people that have little to no experience in vr to see, and learn.\n\nHelpful | 57", "ChimiedelameFeb 3 at 2:51 PM\nTo buy urgently !!\n\nFirst games I want to replay!

It was released a little over an hour ago, and I only stopped playing to take a break and write this review.\nCost: 5 stars - I would have paid twice as much for this game. Worth every penny\nGraphics: 5 stars - The devs put this together beautifully. They put the detail where it needs to be.\nStory: 5 stars - The game jumps you right in and the story just flows and draws you in perfectly.\nImmersion: 5 stars - the game comes together seemlessly, with the graphics, story, controls, characters, and use of VR.\nThis isn't a full locomotion type of experience. I've been sitting on my couch comfortably. Yet the VR is critical in making this game what it is. The view is 3rd person and 1st person at the same time; you are remotely hacked into the environment, security cameras are your eyes, and you are the main characters eyes. You direct her, and you'll need every camera view to see every angle, to know what's ahead. Some things you can directly interact with by hacking. some, you interact with using Hope. The object is to NOT get caught, to avoid detection and be a ghost.\nIf I were to compare this to any other game, I would say Metal Gear (the classic) combined with Hitman in VR. You're playing 2 people at once, and you can feel them each independent yet seemless.\nGreat job, devs. I don't think the newness will wear off for a while.\n\nHelpful | 223", "stuart.fisher.79Aug 28, 2019 at 12:05 AM\nMore 3D than VR\n\nIll start by saying I didnt get further than the second chapter but this feels (mechanics and visuals) like a game from several console generations ago (early 2000s generation).\nThe distinction for me between 3D and full VR is that with the flip between fixed camera perspectives the game feels more like a nice 3D experience than a full VR one (where you can move about freely in a full virtual world).\nUltimately I got frustrated quite early on in the second chapter when evading the guards the main protagonist didnt go where I wanted her to resulting in numerous lengthy trips back to the cell.\n\nGood story but just not enough of a VR experience and too fiddly to keep me playing.\n\nHelpful | 14", "Georgiagirl7Jun 2 at 9:42 PM\nLots of drama and interactions\n\nI love the game I was on the edge of my seat the whole game and I love solving puzzles and figuring things out the only downside was I hated the ending the character went through all of that just to kill herself I thought that was just a kill joy\n\nHelpful | 2", "GeorgehelenJan 14 at 12:34 PM\nBest game Ive ever played\n\nObviously its subjective and totally a personal choice but for me its my favourite game so far of all the quest games Ive tried.

Actually has the best story of any VR game I have played. But like I said there is no real VR element to it.

This game seems fully optimized for VR to me. You are able to control your 3D character in a 3D environment similar to the perspective in Moss. In Republique however you will have much more variety in perspective as you take control of security cameras and navigate the beautiful map and phone interface. The character interaction is point and click and offers a variety of stealth and tactical options. Lots of fun. Vivid story and voice acting. Headphones are a must for me. Playing as a hacker whos viewpoint originates from various security cameras in the environment really lends itself to the Quest field of view for a more naturally immersive experience.\n\nHelpful | 7", "harrisbiAug 4, 2019 at 10:28 PM\nWorst developer and support\n\nI bought this game the day it came out and loved it.

This game plays like Moss w/ less music and more fascism. Get it, you won't be disappointed. I've been playing about 3-4 hours and the game has not crashed or had any major errors. Those complaining about the game asking them to move into the play area should reset their guardian view.
