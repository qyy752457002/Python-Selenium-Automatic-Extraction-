Except as set forth above, the Service Subscription Fee for any Service shall be non-refundable. If timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Provider for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision of the Agreement, or if Supernatural is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Website, the Application or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Supernatural has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any Services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in Supernaturals sole discretion and that Supernatural shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account.\n\nTermination of Services by You.

Supernatural Properties can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services and Content that are not available in your country. These references do not imply that Supernatural intends to announce such Services or Content in your country.

Supernatural makes no representations that Supernatural Properties are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use Supernatural Properties from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION. Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (\"Arbitration Agreement\") carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Supernatural and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.\n\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with Supernatural, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Supernatural may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.\n\nArbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware 19808. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMSs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMSs rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Supernatural will pay them for you. In addition, Supernatural will reimburse all such JAMSs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\n\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nAuthority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Supernatural. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forums rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\n\nWaiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND SUPERNATURAL HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Supernatural are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n\nWaiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SUPERNATURAL THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsections limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.\n\n30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to support@getsupernatural.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

Except as provided in subsection 17.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\nSurvival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Supernatural.\n\nModification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Supernatural makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Supernatural at the following address: Within Unlimited, Inc., 3760 Motor Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90034.\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\nElectronic Communications.

Any agreement you have with your payment provider governs your use of your specified payment method.

It is cool to be able to have good music you actually know in there. Its excellent high intensity, low impact cardio workout (lots of upper body movement with lunges). You do have to be super precise with hits sometimes but I kind of like that. It requires a little more of you physically as it is, which is the point of a workout app anyway.\n\nThe problem is the price tag. I get that continuing to make content isnt free, but Id happily pay $25 for a copy of the app as it stands today with 30 or so workouts, and buy add ons for more workouts later if I decide to. Id even consider the annual subscription if it was around $50, and only included a couple new workouts weekly.\n\nBut maybe the economics of music licensing dont work out that way...?\n\nIf it provided a more complete workout, incorporating weightlifting, body weight resistance, plyometric activity and more stretching or yoga, then the corporate gym membership price would seem more reasonable.\n\nIf you just need to start an exercise habit, the most effective program is the one you stick with. And yeah, if I was using the app every day, I would value it more. But its a once or twice a week kind of activity for me.\n\nWish there was a purchase option for those of us who dont need infinite new content.\n\nHelpful | 329", "CrystalSundaraJul 25 at 8:01 PM\nExceeded all my expectations!\n\nThe beautiful scenery and new workouts added daily that source a daily music catalogue were why I wanted to try it. There is so much more to this app that make the subscription fee more than worth it. In fact my husband quickly got into it as well. We signed up for a second account because they do t have profiles yet (I understand they will be adding this feature soon though). We have each completed at least one Supernatural workout every single day for more than 8 weeks now. We've never been this consistent with working out before. We have the fitness gains to show how important consistency is.\n\nSupernatural went well beyond what I was expecting when I first signed up. Quality is built in from top to bottom and they keep improving it. The beat maps are very thoughtfully done with rhythm, enjoyability, and fitness in mind. I was not expecting the coaches to be that impactful, but they have been absolutely amazing! You really feel like they're there with you. They make you smile and laugh and get you to push harder and give it your all.\n\nI usually don't become a superfan of things (or write reviews often), but I really love Supernatural. It's substantially improved my husband and my lives.\n\nHelpful | 28\nDeveloper ResponseJul 26 at 9:17 AM\n\nThanks so much for the feedback, and great job in working out in Supernatural every single day. That is quite an accomplishment! Thanks for the kind words on the mapping, the landscapes, and of course our Supernatural coaches. Thanks again for being a valued member of the Supernatural, please don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions, feature requests, etc.", "ambercalmJul 25 at 3:54 PM\nSupernatural Makes My Life Better\n\nOkay, so I feel like it's impossible for me to be subjective because I am so deeply affected by this \"game.\" I've wanted this kind of VR full body and mind experience but didn't know if it was possible. Beat Saber and BoxVR were by far my favorite experiences up to finding Supernatural and I played those once in a while. BeatSaber was more fun and BoxVR game me some muscle.\n\nSupernatural blew my mind. Full disclosure, after the first free month, I committed to the full year subscription. I don't compare the price to the way other games are. I compare it to physical fitness and mental health expenses. After hiking for five years I spent a lot of money on a backpack upgrade that improved my regular exercise and health experience. I've spent cumulatively a lot on shoes and fitness clothes.\n\nThe game is amazing. The sets are diverse songs you'd hear on the radio and you're going to have a lot of feelings from them. The coaches... I can't even... they are so personal and genuine and fun. They're not just coaching your bodies. They're right there with you, coaching you. I can't tell you how many times I've had a tough time in regular life and heard one of the coaches giving me a pep talk. And they're part of the online community.\n\nThe online community is so real and positive and is as much a part of Supernatural as the \"game\" dynamics. Oh, and the creators and coaches listen to the community and you get to see real-life updates and suggestions implemented in real-time. I wouldn't believe it if I was reading this review. haha.\n\nAnyway, I'm just going to say flat out that I was in a pretty dark place, like a lot of people right now. And Supernatural saved my quality of life. I'm stronger physically and mentally. Regular joyful endorphins every single day and part of this community... I'm a happier healthier person who sleeps better and has found hope and health. :)\n\nHelpful | 24", "cbearabooJul 25 at 2:21 PM\nMy favorite!\n\nThis workout is the only workout I look forward too.

Before you know it, its over.\n\nThis app was really well designed. Everyday new workouts are available.\n\nTo those people who are complaining about the monthly subscription fee, stop being cheap. You could easily spend more at Starbucks than you would for the cost to train and make yourself healthy. How do you expect these people to make this amazing content for free?\n\nOne suggestion to make it even better: make it so that you could flag a work out as a favorite at the end of a work out instead of having to scroll through and having to find it after finishing.\n\nKeep up the good work guys!\n\nHelpful | 5", "DickyJames6 days ago\nI haven't felt that great in a long time\n\nSupernatural is a smart way to get back in and stay in shape.

I have to stop myself from trying to squeeze one more set in. I make it through a 30-minute workout, dripping with sweat, breathing heavily, and wanting more. I find myself enjoying music I don't usually listen to and moving like I wouldn't on a normal day. Being home more than usual, Supernatural makes me feel like I've been out in nature, laughing with friends, and working up a sweat. Yes, it costs more than most apps, but the coaches, quality of the videos, constant updating, attention to detail/feedback, the built-in community, motivation, the way it makes me want to move and did I say the coaches? - I'm sold! Nothing like it on Oculus. It's an investment in my physical and mental health. Some small issues with losing tracking, quick draining of the controller batteries, and fit/comfort with the headset with profuse sweating!

You get to join the supernatural community  on Facebook and other social media cites where you are met with an overwhelming amount of support. This is NOT A GAME! This is like joining a gym or fitness group. The app creatures and the coaches read all the posts and respond to your questions and even your random suggestions!!!!!! They actually customs the workouts to what the clients are asking for!! To me thats worth every penny. What other VR game can claim that?! I cant stress enough how amazing these people are.

It's a real workout, that happens to use a central mechanism that, yes, is similar to Beat Saber.\nBut you get licensed music for songs you know, custom playlists, beautiful environments, professional coaches, and a full body workout that is real exercise. I consider all of these to be an advantage over Beat Saber.\nYour first 30 days are free, and then it's a monthly (or annual) subscription after that. I understand some people don't like the idea of monthly payments for a VR app. But if you compare it to Peloton...people don't seem to object to the idea of a monthly membership for that service. That's really what Supernatural is aiming to be. A service.\nThe best exercise is the one you stick with.

As a result, I absolutely love the fuller workout of Supernatural and am probably going to sign up for the subscription for at least a while after my trial because I hate going to gyms. I enjoy the features everyone else has described and agree that more immersive backgrounds (including fantasy) would be awesome.. and, I do agree with concerns about the price point. When I started out, the low intensity workouts were taxing but I've progressed rapidly and am now doing the low intensity workouts 7 days a week plus about 20 minutes normal level Best Saber and it works for an over 60 y o person. A couple of thoughts about additions-- first, I'd like to be able to change the color of the orbs. The white one is sometimes hard to see against a sunshiny sky. Second, don't assume old people/low intensity people don't like hip hop and EDF/trap/dubstep. This was actually a big draw for me to do Beat Saber as the beats are so fun. I'd love to be able to pick my genre as well as my intensity level. I do love all the 80s stuff and retrofit though! I agree with people that the variable intensity is too taxing. Finally, I feel foolish but for the life of me I can't figure out how to exit the app when I'm done with my workout and return to the home screen to do something else.

I stumbled across it by accident and Im so glad I did. Ive been wanting to get into exercising for a long time, but I always would sizzle out and give up. Ive been consistent with this for almost 2 months now. Im down 12 pounds, which is even better! \n\nPros-\n\n-I love the competitive aspect. You can friend people on their app and it shows who has the most points. This paired with my Apple Watch shows me how much I burn, I love that\n\n-There is a variety of music and playlists. Even if they repeat songs they are usually with different trainers and different levels of difficultly so theyre never exactly the same.\n\n-The trainers make themselves available on Discord. I always have fast responses if I have questions either there or through email. Theyre very helpful.\n\n-They just implemented a meditation that happens after some workouts. Its very peaceful!\n\n-The scenery is so awesome! Sometimes it feels like Im really there.\n\n-The $19 price point isnt for everyone. To me, it was completely worth it. Its a 45 minute drive to the gym for me, and not something I want to do. They just added a 1 year plan which comes to $12 a month. That was an added bonus for me.\n\n-This game is intense. I could barely get through them at first. Now I can endure the high intensity ones, so I know Im getting into shape. Its also been great to see how my heart rate is staying lower longer. I still play beat saber but its so much easier than Supernatural. One is a game, one is a workout. For anyone who wants to push their limits, Supernatural is great.\n\nCons-\n\n-I wish we could see how many minutes are left in the workout. I also wish we could see the remaining song list while in the workout. You can see them before you start but I usually have never heard of the songs so I forget. I like knowing how long I have left, sometimes it gives me that boost of energy.\n\n-Sometimes the pause button doesnt work. They are working on it though, so hopefully this wont be an issue much longer. (This is now fixed!)\n\nAll in all, this game is very fun. Ive never been consistent with exercise in my life and this was the push I needed. Im sold, and Ill be staying with them for as long as its out!\n\nHelpful | 3", "lodes665 days ago\nFavorite Game! A few suggestions...\n\nBy far my favorite game on the Oculus Quest and is the reason I bought the quest in the first place. I consistently work out with this game 4 to 5 times a week up from barely being able to finish a set when I first purchased.... A few suggestions to make it, in my opinion, even better.\n\n1. Allow us to mute trainers. I like to play sets multiple times, especially if I wasn't able to nail it the first time or if the music was particularly motivating. Would love the ability to mute the coaches, especially on the 2nd or later go around. Some times a coach is 'too much' for me the first time and I shy away from playing the set again, I just find the chatter too distracting. I know some people are really into that, so not suggesting you change the personalities or what they are doing, just allow me to mute them instead of reducing to half volume.\n\n2. Allow us to make our own playlists. I love that there's a new set that comes out daily, but would love to be able to mix and match my favorite songs from different sets and create my own 'Best of' playlists. Would also be kind of cool to see the playlists that others come up with.\n\n3. Let us pick level. Some of the songs are favorites... but they are at the wrong level for me. I'm finally comfortable with regularly playing Medium sets, but High sets are beyond me still, by song two, my arms are dead and my head is spinning. At the same time, the Low level sets are a little to slow right now and I tend away from them unless I need a rest day. Would be fun if each set came out where we could pick the level L-M-H and still run through the entire set, but at a speed that was appropriate for me. I'm sure that this is a bunch of work to do, but this is my wish list!\n\nThanks for all the hard work you continuously put into this, like I said from the outset, definitely my favorite game to play!\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response5 days ago\n\nHey there - thanks so much for the feedback.

It's amazing! There's a new workout posted every day and I still have access to every single workout from their release date. The coaches help motivate you and encourage you to swing powerfully with good form. I love that I had a 30 day free trial to see if it was right for me. It works with a bunch of heart rate monitors so you can tell if you're getting a good workout. That and the sweat dripping down my face are pretty good indicators. Lol. They have different intensity levels so you can choose what's right for you. I'd describe it as Beat Saber in nature and the force at which you hit the targets matters. I love the variety in workouts, music, and trainers. It costs much less than a gym membership and I do Supernatural every single day (way more often than I went to the gym).

Instead of sabers it's baseball bats and instead of blocks it's balloons.\n\nGranted, they DO give you motivational talk and the overall feel is based around fitness. There are virtual trainers but very shallow past the tutorial. For example they will say like \"dig deep\" or \"to finish up the song, bash the balloons as hard as you can\" or \"be sure to focus on breathing while keeping form\" in a narrative voice over the generic music.\n\nBasically, I would not pay for it.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response4 days ago\n\nHi there.

However, this app is basically cutting out the lower and middle class.\n\nThere is nothing unique here; its beat saber with a voiceover.\n\nIts comparable to a gym... no, its not. A gym is a brick and mortar location with physical equipment and insurance. Supernatural is digital information delivered to a platform Ive already purchased.\n\nTheres not any kind of custom workout or changes to the programming based on your performance. Theres no goals. More body tracking and unique physical fun was done on Wii Fit over a decade ago. If Supernatural kept user performance data on a server and routines were changed based on that user, that would be a technology worth paying a monthly access for. As of now, Supernatural should be have a lower cost model at $30 which comes with a baseline library of old routines. Then addon $1 for two routines can be purchased. This model would include everyone that wants to work out with Supernatural. No reason to just let rich people in who dont care about wasting money for pop hits to play while they do a more scenic beat saber.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper Response10 days ago\n\nHey there, thanks for giving us a try and providing some feedback.

I read a zillion reviews where users were endlessly complaining about the price tag of this \"Beatsaber-esque\" game. I signed up for the free 30 day trial. They had a promotion that after the 30 days, I would receive a discount if I paid for the year up front = $149 total. That's $12.41 a month for 12 months (not including my free month.)\n\nHere's my take - at first, I thought the workouts were actually a bit too hard. The Target-hit feel wasn't spot on and I kind of got annoyed with the trainers talking over the music. I didn't like that you couldn't enjoy the scenery either. I challenged myself to play this game everyday or every other day in tandem with Beatsaber and BoxVR. After the month was up, I was hooked. I love the variety that Supernatural gives me. A true exercise game geared towards actual fitness. You are required to reach higher, squat faster, and move with a quickness! While BeatSaber and BoxVR became too easy, Supernatural remains a challenge. I still think hitting the targets could have a better tactile feel and the trainers should just shut the hell up every once in a while. But whatever - I'm in this for the calories burned. And it totally does that. My body is stronger and I feel better. To me, this is completely worth the $12.41 a month. If I use it 3 times a week; that's about $1 per workout. $1 per workout is such chump change and 100% worth it.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJul 17 at 8:19 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback and giving Supernatural a shot.

I new VR workout everyday with a good music and a motivating coaches that know when to interject and push you forward almost like they were there. I wasn't in bad shape to start and each program makes me sweat every single time. I do it pretty much every single day without fail and look forward to it. Some people maybe put off by the price but let me ask you this? If I have something that I enjoy that makes me sweat, offers new content every single day, and doesn't require me to get up and go to a gym ( least of all during a global pandemic) if you can afford the price of a gym membership this is a great alternative. Plus free 30 days to decide is more than enough. Some people will also say it's too much like a membership based beat saber. I'm not going to deny the physical action is similar but the result is way different with not just dance music and great music offered perfectly craft 3D environments, an overall level of polish that makes you excited to jump in everyday.\n\nI really enjoy supernatural and you might too.\n\nHelpful | 8", "DLASTMOJICAN20 days ago\nVR P90X\n\nI cant tell you just how sore I was when I first tried it!!

I love the modern songs and even songs from early 2000, 90s, 80s, and more. Ive had a couple of songs that are my jams and have pumped me up whenever I start to get tired. Honestly, I love it best with the Oculus ear phones (great quality but thats a different story), especially if youre working out in the early morning or late at night, but having it play normally works just fine.\n\nThe coaches are awesome as well. They give me the right kind of motivation. Theyll notice when I start to veer off course or its crazy how many times they tell me to breathe when I indeed forget to breathe.\n\nThe environments are breathtaking and immersive.\n\nLately, they added meditation and wow!!!

Amazing music/workout plan for sweat symphony. So much fun to use classical - can I recommend doing some more of these? Perhaps think about Handel or trumpet (brass led really) voluntaries. Wynton Marsalis has fantastic set of trumpet led classical pieces on cd In Gabriels Garden. Also what about in the Hall of the mountain king? Anyways - lovely to have more options.\n\n2. In terms of favorite workouts - can you put a favorite tag on the screen after you end a workout - instead of having to click out to the main screen to favorite a workout, would be nice to have on screen showing your stats immediately post workout. Also - it says rate the workout 1-5. But I don't know which is better 1 or 5? Need to show high/low.\n\n3. Also can we rate the workout more in depth? Aka rate music vs. workout .\n\n4. Can you automatically add leaderboard to include the family profiles? Love that we can now share 4 profiles on same device - but realistically until I can convince others to purchase vr, they are only ones using this app. So would be great to have their workouts visible.\n\n5. Also it might be nice to have workouts where you can disable the squats or arms - aka if you want a workout focused on one part because say you've injured your knee...and don't want to slow down the arm motions, but do need to not squat. It would be cool to have those options.\n\nAnyways - really loving this app it's great for working out.

After using it the first time, I could barely use stairs the next day! The coach guided workouts you get are not only helpful but entertaining as well! I look forward to my workouts every day now and LOVE the music and routines! Since one metric is power, you cant just get away with flicking your wrists to hit targets flying at you and all around nor can you get away with slightly dodging objects. To score high, you have to have proper form, strength and motion. Dont let others tell you its like that game that rhymes with seat baber. It most certainly isnt. I play both but only Supernatural gets me drenched in sweat and a max heart rate which for me, is normally around 190. Yes you have a $19 per month subscription but I paid more than that per week on coffee at Barstucks! Give up the high price of coffee and join the Supernatural community instead! And by the way, the coaches and members have an awesome community on Facebook too! They are highly interactive with members and though virtual, you feel like a member in an exclusive gym that meets above the Andes mountains, above an active volcano and even the Galapagos! Honestly, dont knock it until youve tried it. I couldnt give a higher recommendation of this app if I wanted to. Seriously, get it now!\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper ResponseJul 24 at 5:08 PM\n\nHey there - thanks so much for the feedback and recommendation.

Ive tried getting VR exercise with other apps and games in the past, and while they can get your heart rate up, they are all lacking as a real workout regime.\n\nSupernatural is extremely polished and full featured. Some of the things that sets it apart:\n1) The locations are beautiful... stunning. Youre working out perched above an impressive selection of photorealistic high resolution, 360 degree 3D vistas from around the globe. You dont feel cramped inside a tiny room, but instead feel like your outdoors in the open and free\n2) Huge selection of workouts, at different intensities, depending on your skill level\n3) Personal trainers: Like the locations, the trainers appear at the start and end of your workout as a high res 3D hologram of sorts and give you tips and warmups it feels like youre there with a real person. They also talk to you throughout the workout and it really helps motivate a LOT.\n4) Music: The music is a HUGE selling point on this app. Everything else on the Oculus store uses b-rate electronic or dub step thats cheap for the developers to license. Supernatural has big-name hit music from a ton of different genres. Today I was working out to Queen. And each workout has a different musical theme or selection.\n5) Smart watch integration: This one is really important to me. You can link the app up to your Apple Watch or other smart device to track your heart rate. In between each song, you get a scoreboard that shows you how youre tracking in each zone as your workout progresses.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. You are given two bats, like baseball bats, one for each hand. Two different colored pods pass by, and you need to smash the white pods with one bat and the black pods with the other. Its kind of like Beat Saber, but much more refined. Sparkling paths sometimes appear behind the pods that you have to follow with your hand, and triangular gates appear that require a squat or lunge to get through. Sometimes you have to turn 180 degrees as you follow the paths. Its a flowy, truly supernatural kind of experience.\n\nNow... the subscription model. Its always easy to balk at any kind of app thats priced as a service and not as a 1-time purchase. I can be apprehensive about that as well. However, in this case, it appears to be justified. This is like paying for your Apple Music or Spotify membership, except youre getting way more than simple access to music tracks. Youre getting a fully developed, incredibly polished, full featured experience. I am going to continue to use this app, and probably wont be renewing my gym membership once the pandemic is over.\n\nHelpful | 4", "karylannJul 25 at 2:42 PM\nEntirely too fast\n\nUpdate: I have changed my rating to an enthusiastic five stars! Thankfully the developers have changed the difficulty ratings to set low, medium, and high intensity workouts. I use this app nearly everyday. It has become my primary cardio workout especially during this time of reduced access to my local gym. Some folks may balk at the monthly subscription fee, but I feel it is definitely worth it. No other VR app that I've seen adds new content on a daily basis! The workouts are both fun and intense! An added benefit is the Facebook group where other users and the trainers interact and encourage each other on a daily basis. I'm so happy I tried this app when it first came out and I will definitely continue using it long into the future.\n\nI just want to know if these workouts have been tested on real humans. I'm fit. I have good reflexes and I routinely stay in the 90% range on all my workouts in this app. But do they have to be so frustratingly fast? It's human nature to try to hit everything coming at you but it gets to where balls are coming so fast and frequent that the bats can't even register a hit and go right through the balls. I end up flailing around and all attention to good form goes right out the window and I notice my knees start hurting. It's more than possible to get an excellent workout without feeling so completely discouraged in the middle of the game. Please rethink how many balls get thrown at people. I want to continue with this app but if it's going to stay at this pace I'm not so sure I will.\n\nHelpful | 6", "Telly80Jul 25 at 1:31 PM\nThey listen to their users!\n\nUpdate- supernatural listened to complaints and changed the format to make it easier to see difficulties, and added more beginner levels.

But I cant figure out which class is beginner, except the one that says beginner only.

I know others are comparing it to Beat Saber, but for me there's no comparison. In Supernatural the emphasis is on power, and moving through the full range of motion, not flicking your wrist as fast as you can. Also, the trainers are fantastic. It really does make a difference hearing their encouragement throughout the workout. And I love that even though I am standing in my living room, I can virtually work out in Machu Picchu or in front of an iceberg in Greenland :)\n\nHelpful | 5", "caddmantxJul 20 at 11:10 AM\n56 yr old needing cardio in the A/C.\n\nI am a 56 year old male who likes to run.

Just no room for it. I do have a clear area for my Oculus Quest games soooo...along comes Supernatural!\nThis \"game\" may not be for everyone. If so, don't give it a poor rating, just move on. If it is for you then leave the rating you feel is appropriate and comment away!\nI like this workout. I turn on a fan pointed at me an jump in. I like to do a couple of workouts at the medium or high level and then end with a low key workout. You can choose your intensity, your favorite coach, each work out is shown with the songs so you know what you're getting. You can pay monthly at equal to $1 (US) a day if you do 5 workouts a week. You can pay around 60 cents (US) for the annual subscription for the same workout schedule (5 a week). Workout 7 days a week and you average per workout is less. Try doing that at a gym, if one is open. Walk into a gym and hand them a dollar and walk into an aerobics class and see how they react.\nIt seems that a lot of the suggestions are being incorporated into the game. Yesterday I noticed that the feedback when I hit a target was more pronounced.\nNow, the only thing negative I have to say is that there are too many name brand, been around a long time, heart rate trackers out there that are not supported. I have always owned Fitbit products and Samsung (Android OS) phones. I do not want to buy another product to track my heartrate just for this game.

GET IT..\n\n...\n.\nLet me start out by saying how much I love this game. It's a great workout and it's fun.\n\nI think the main thing that keeps me coming back though isn't the game, but the community for the game. There's a group on Facebook and the coaches are responsive and so is the team that works behind the scenes. They listen to what everyone says.\n\nHere's my major suggestions to make it better:\n\nFree play mode. I would love to put together a few songs that I love playing. I enjoy seeing the daily workouts too but sometimes I just want to pick out what I want.\n\nFailing that, can you put together a workout that's just centipede like four or five times?

To be fair, I'm not a traditional gamer, the adrenaline pumping games have always stressed me out, but this is the perfect mashup of workout and game for me. I struggled with listing cons bc i realized all but a couple of my \"cons\" are just features I'd love to see in future updates so beneath cons you'll find those suggestions in \"areas of improvement.\"\n\nPros:\n\n1. The people who designed this game clearly learned to clap on the 2 and 4. The timing of the hits from the beat mapping is AbsoLUTELY 2nd to none. I tried Beat Saber and the other 2 fames others have gone on about, and I KNOW they are geared toward people who clap on 1 and 3 bc there is no beat to be found in them. This issue alone makes this the only real rhythm based game to play.\n\n2. The scenery helps put you into a great mood while you're working out. It's beautiful, a d they do a great job of matching locations with songs and vibes.\n\n3. The coaches are great. They guide you through each workout and keep you motivated.\n\n4. The music is AMAZING. It was skewing to oldies more at first, but there's a decent mix now. I love that it's quality music while also being stuff we're more likely to recognize and pick up the patterns on quickly.\n\n5. It. Is. A. WORKOUT. I have used this app everyday since I got it, and it leaves me dripping with sweat in less than 30 minutes a day. I've worked my way up to medium intensity workouts now, and I alternate between legs arms and core. It has transformed my body already.\n\n6. The whole design and feel of the app are a part of the draw. It doesn't feel like I'm dragging myself to work out or even to push through when I'm spent. It feels like I'm escaping off to a tranquil place and sweating my troubles away.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The price. As much as I love this app, $20/month is a LOT. Only my Audible subscription costs as much and even they have a less expensive option. I'm with y'all for as long as I can be, but I don't see me doing $20/month for more than a few months. There should really be a download and play option anyway for mobility if nothing else.\n\n\nAreas of Improvement\n\n1. Please add more search categories to the workout menu. It'd be very useful to know what part of the body each workout will hit. Also, I'd love to be able to search for workouts with specific songs or artists.\n\n2. It would be awesome if we could play individual songs as well instead of only full, curated playlists. This would be esPEcially helpful for trying to learn patterns for the higher intensity workouts.\n\n3. Would love it if we could make our own playlists from the available songs. And honestly, this feature coupled with being able to use our own music would be worth the $20/month.\n\n4. Stretching. It would add to the health benefit and safety of this app if I didn't have to look up guided stretches on YouTube before and after using it. The stretches the coaches sometimes throw in before or after workouts and call warm ups or cool downs are not it. I'm told the users for the device skew older. I know I'm over here aching, and I'm in my 30s, so everybody could benefit from some good guided stretches.\n\n5. Please more scenes! We keep getting new workouts, please throw some new scenery in there, too!\n\n\nThat's all I can think of for now, but i gave it 5 stars because if this app was $30 or even $50 or $60 as is with no more updates, I'd buy it, love it, and give it 5 stars. The high subscription fee with no as is option is my only real complaint.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response8 hours ago\n\nHey there, thanks so much for the detailed review.

Here are a few reasons why I absolute love Supernatural.\n1- The play list is fun! You can choose the instructor that better fits you music style.\n2- Every one can do it, Low, Medium and High intensity makes it doable for all.\n3- The targets flows seamlessly, without tricks to make you fail, for exemple when you hit up the next target will most likely be swinging down. So even on the Hight intensity workout it is challenging no doubt about it, it is still an enjoyable challenge, you dont feel like they are trying hard to make you make a mistake.\n4- The hits goes smooth with the beat! If you can dance or can keep up a beat, there is nothing more infuriating than a song game off the rhythm, no matter what level you are on your he hits will be to the beat.\n5- And no this is not beat saber, it has nothing to do with beat saber.\n6- You will workout more than just arms, the squats and lunges will give you a whole body workout.\n7- Raneir Pollard (one of the instructors) is amazing! He is good for my soul! Im always looking forward for my workouts!\nIf you are thinking of getting it! Get it! Its amazing!!!\nI have a few suggestions.\n1- make it possible so we can practice one song.\n2- there is a big Brazilian crowd here, would be good if you added some songs in Portuguese, there are a few made for the American crowed by Annita the songs are in English and Portuguese.\n3- fix the search for instructor tab, I cant scroll down.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJul 30 at 9:23 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the review and the great feedback.

Triangles also introduce proper lunges and squats\n- If you actually use the muscles they tell you to use such as your core, following through with your arms etc, it's more than just slashing at targets so it feels like a well rounded workout\n\nCons\n- There is a lot of hip hop and rap and I'm not really a fan, but then it's countered with ALT J, Queen and others so... it's improving I think.\n- Lack of customization leaves something to be desired. This I'm sure will eventually be improved with song selection perhaps?\n- Simple trackers like Garmin/Fitbit are not supported unfortunately\n- Price is steep when compared to games. I am thinking of it as a workout and considering gym memberships/group training is usually more and impossible right now, I'm okay with it, but can see this as a big barrier to entry for folks.\n\nHelpful | 16\nDeveloper ResponseMay 29 at 9:09 AM\n\nHey there - Very cool to hear that Supernatural has you enjoying working out.

Then.. Blah...\n\nI have been using this app for over a week now on a daily basis and here is my two cents on what possibly could be a great workout VR application.\n\nLet's be honest here.. There are so many other \"move and slash\" VR games / Applications on the oculus market. This company definitely did not design the format, but they are trying to improve on it.\n\nI am not a super fit, young guy with the stamina to keep up with most of the songs they lined up. I fit more into the older dad model who is an empty nester and just wants to have a good workout while having fun doing it.\n\nHere are some things that I feel should be improved:\n\n1 - The controller feedback when you hit a target is weak. Users should be able to control the level of feedback. The audio cues for a hit also fall in line with this and should be louder. I am constantly thinking if I succeeded in hitting a target or not.\n\n2 - The built in Level adjustment while playing takes way too long to kick in and all it does is frustrates you while you continue to swing like a crazy person instantly decreasing your motivation to continue.\n\n3 - There is no way to see how far along you are in your song line up. If you pause, you see what song you are on, but not how many songs you have left or how much time is left to the end of your routine.\n\n4 - The music in the app seems to only focus on the younger generation. Almost all of the songs are made for people 30 and under. I have not heard of most of these songs and getting into a song that you have never heard before and have no \"connection\" with is difficult. They introduced a Retrofit routine a few days ago and it was almost perfect. Definitely what us \"older\" generation needs. There needs to be a much wider range of music available before I can commit to this app.\n\n5 - Targeting is one of my biggest issues with this program. One day I played several of my other move and slash games before I jumped back into Supernatural and I don't care what the company says, there is definitely an issue with the hit-scan. I can play any other game and be on target, but the targeting on this feels lazy and inaccurate at times. This is a real issue and should be addressed.\n\n6 - This is really not an issue, just a side note. I know one of the selling points for this program is the stunning background visuals while playing. This is a great feature, but in some ways just wasted due to the fact that when you are doing your routine you really don't have time to look around and appreciate where you are.\n\nThis is my two cents on Supernatural..\n\nHelpful | 199", "MskaaJul 27 at 10:07 AM\nNice workout but...\n\nI signed up for the 30 day trial, I probably used it 20 of the days. It's a good workout and the trainers are fun. It syncs with some activity trackers but not fitbit. If you have physical limitations, ie bad knees, you cannot e\nModify the routines to accommodate, the squats or lunges are built in to the routines. The routines will make you sweat, both from the exercise and the price tag. I don't mind buying apps I will use, but I just can't justify a monthly fee or annual fee when I can workout using my other apps. 4stars due to not syncing with fitbit and inability to modify to accomodate physical differences and abilities.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 10:55 AM\n\nHi there - thank you for the note and giving Supernatural a try.

It does turn into just another exercise after playing it for several weeks, which is why I bought the monthly. This price is way too much to pay and I may cancel after I get bored with it once and for all.

However, it's simply Beat Saber with different music and scenes. $179- $200 a year is ludicrous. This didn't work with either of my heart rate monitors. You can't choose music. You can't mute a certain very loud and extremely repetitive instructor. You can only select level intensity of the workout. There is only one kind of workout.

His workouts are consistent (give me a sec) and has great music. He tries to keep the workouts fun (they all probably try and maybe this is a personal preference)\n\nHowever what's not a personal preference is how inconsistent the workouts of the other two trainers. You'll be working through a Low Intensity workout and then all of a sudden you're in the middle of a Medium Intensity workout. That demoralizes you and makes you not want to workout any longer. And... well... that's what I'm doing. I'll only use this about 1/3 of what I've been using it because I'll only do workouts with the one trainer.\n\nMusic has been a beef of mine for a while as well but again this is personal preferances. I don't like 70's music or 80's glam bands. Of course, this is probably a licensing issue so I\"m not going to harp too much about this but it's definintely been a gripe of mine as well.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response11 days ago\n\nHey there, thanks for the feedback.

Games like beatsaber use music as well and for the big names you pay for the music extra but a one time extra cost. iaif they adopted this model then I feel they could succeed. But they could pay Their team with the revenue of say a 30 dollars game.\nTo be honest I get more of a workout playing boxing or pistol whip. Also no matter how you play the game will and does not adjust for you level so how can you charge monthly of it isn't really customized for the individual.

I love the scenery and birds chirping, and that you are standing on a mid air saucer type stand, its so surreal! The workouts are gorgeous and they change the workouts weekly and music weekly so it does NOT get boring at all!!!\nthey have L, M, H and PRO level. You can chose your workout by the letter on the workout choice. Its in the upper corner.\nThe workout consists of triangles that move either slow, fast, whatever mode you are in.

You can determine if app is right for you within that amount of time.\n\nCons:\n-$19 is a month is a bit too high for a lot of people. I think if you used it everyday and the variety and workouts is there, then it would be worthwhile.\n-As mentioned in the article, you do need a good size play space. The exercises have you swinging in a full 360 degree rotation around the play area. A yoga mat or something that will keep you physically oriented would be a must have for small play spaces.\n\nOverall:\nFor now, it is a great mix of a lot of VR exercise type games and experience that I have played over the years.

I'm also hoping they see this honest feedback and adjust. If this were a one time purchase, I think I'd enjoy it. Somewhat. Kinda. It's a decent enough workout. Too bad, at the moment, there are so many flaws that I can't focus on what I do like.\n\nPros\nThe scenes are pretty\nThe workout will get you sweaty.\n\n\nCons\nOne of the reasons for their model is their licenses with popular songs. Considering that 3 other fitness games on quest so far officially support allowing you to work out to custom mapped songs (using your own music), this one falls a little flat.\n\nAlso, you can't choose individual songs to play. That sort of shoots the content draw in the foot.\n\nThe other thing they're touting is new workout routines each day. Which is fine...but there is only one each day. So if it has music you don't like or is a longer/shorter duration than you want... you'd end up playing through an older routine....so...I'm honestly not a fan of hip hop and pretty much every workout has had a song I took my headphones out for. I've heard a few people say \"well if you class you can't pick the music,\" I know. That's one of the reasons I don't do classes.\n\nThen there's the \"trainers\" I'm not sure how I feel about them. It's not like a real trainer. At the begining of each workout you see a recording of them...and they maybe walk you through 30 seconds of stretching. After that, once you're playing the game they just spout generic pre-recorded advice, which you can't turn off. It's distracting it's not like I can focus on what they are saying and hit the balloons fast enough. These are recordings. Nothing personal about it.\n\nYou can't reset songs while you're playing. So if you need to re adjust your headset and want to restart just one song, nope. You'd have to do the whole workout again from the main menu.\n\nIf you live in the US, where download speeds are lower, this game takes forever. I think they must have developed this offshore where download speeds are faster. It takes 5 minutes between songs to load. They need to adjust for US streaming speeds, or let us download the tracks locally. UPDATE (4/28/2020): the team seems to have caught this issue and lowered the resolution slightly to decrease the necessary download speeds. Loading is now a lot faster, so I added one star.\n\nAs far as game play, personally it's not all that challenging. VR is how I get my workout in and it's so close to beatsaber that I don't really think its adjusted for people who come in and already play at their highest skill level. It does do squats and lunges..but this too is problematic. You can't turn them off. So if you have knee problems or limited mobility ....too bad. One more thing I don't know how they didn't consider. When you squat, you lean your neck forward naturally. When you're wearing a 5lb headset... Let's just say it isn't pleasant.\n\nThere's no multiplayer or party modes. You can see your friends on a leader board and chat with them.but if you wanted to have like a contest with your spouse...he'd have to have his own account. And pay the full subscription fee. And you'd have to log out of your account and re-sync the headset each time.\n\nAnd you can't change the color of anything. Or pick your own scenes. Or make your own playlist.\n\n\nHonestly, if I was going to pay anything for this game, I wouldn't want half of what they're offering. I'd want to own the base game , so I could download levels and not have to wait for them to stream, and if it came packaged with a weeks worth of workouts and a handful of songs, that would be enough for me to use it for a few minutes per day , a few days per week. Until I got bored. At which point , I'd be happy to purchase. I don't mind paying for content. I mind overpaying. Cause VR has so many great options to make fitness fun, the idea of paying monthly fee that's equivalent to a new game or a proper gym membership just doesn't hold up for one game, even if it adds a new list of music each day, it's still the same thing. And there is no way I could rationalize paying for an iffy game ...ten times more expensive than any other game... especially if I don't actually get to keep the game if I stop playing.\n\nBecause they only have the one beatsaber game, it's hard to justify continuing to pay after the trial. If they add more games, maybe. But not just the one. And even then, not at the price they're asking for Audible.com has a premium subscription. You get 24 credits a year. Enough for 2 audiobooks a month. It's maybe a little more expensive than this is.i paid for it for YEARS. Why? Millions of Hours of content. But more importantly, I keep all the books my credits bought, even if I cancel my membership. And I can still access all of them and if I don't use all my credits in a year, they roll over to the next.\n\nI'm not against subscription models, but know the market you're entering. Gamers don't need VR peloton. And even if they did, this wouldn't be the app I would design.\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper ResponseJul 5 at 6:09 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for taking the time to leave such a long review.

I had similar thoughts when I first heard about it, but I'm glad I tried out the trial, and I've decided to stick around and keep paying for it.\n\nAnd why? Because I'm already seeing RESULTS. I played a ton of BoxVR before trying this game, and Supernatural hits a lot of muscles that BoxVR doesn't. I'm also super, super sweaty after most of SN's workouts, like the one they added this morning. I really love how they add new workouts every day.\n\nThey also have a really great community on Discord. The other players are pretty uplifting and it's really cool seeing the coaches there that you see in the game itself.\n\nI used to go to a bootcamp gym last year, and that was expensive... so if I'm seeing similar results with this game and am able to workout longer than 45 minutes a day like the bootcamp offered, it's an easy decision for me to continue on with SN instead. I like how I can fit in a quick workout before I have to work each day, or at the end of the day.\n\nOne note though--there is a learning curve because some of the workouts can be really intense. I recommend looking for the workouts labeled as L (low intensity) and avoid the ones labeled H at first. They've been working hard at trying to get more lower intensity workouts after players mentioned they had difficulty keeping up. I thought it was nice how responsive they were, and they allow players to also recommend new songs. :)\n\nHelpful | 15\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 12:12 PM\n\nThanks so much for the review.

Well, Ive completely changed my opinion about this app. My original issues were 1-No time to look at the environments before the workout started (the Supernatural Team added a pause button), and 2-the squats and lunges came too fast and seemed too low, and 3-Id like to be able to turn off the coach sometimes (esp. for workouts Ive done before).\n\nIve worked out with Supernatural every single day for the past three weeks and Im completely addicted. The music is fun, new workouts are added every day, and Ive gotten much better at the harder more intense workouts that the speed doesnt feel quite as chaotic as it did to begin with.

But all they seem use are hip-hop (or related genres -- I don't follow the subtleties). Out of roughly 15 tracks thus far, I've encountered one that I find enjoyable. In practice, I'm happier with the more \"limited\" tracks on other games. If they can't use that massive library to give us more choices, then I don't see the point. Once you accept the choice of music, the exercise maps are \"okay\" -- but I can get much better on Beat Saber.\n\nFinally, you've got a bunch of beginners coming in, but you don't give those beginners a way to start without killing themselves. If I want to feel crippled on day two, after doing the \"beginners\" workout, there are lots of other ways I can cause myself pain.

After 28 days, I can't see myself continuing. My rating isn't for the app itself which works well, it's for a subscription that adds no added value. My first biggest disappointment is that the app doesn't cater to me or my fitness level. It SHOULD know that I struggle through the basic workouts (squats, amirite?) but instead suggests an extreme one to me next time. It's supposed to be adaptive - I've never once noticed any adaptation to me or my fitness level; I'm standing there, missing every squat because my legs can't do it, but it sends 100 more. The app is nice, but it's a repetitive workout with an easy to ignore trainer voice and music. The music - a cost factor to require a subscription - but it's double my YouTube Music subscription to listen to a handful of songs. I know the trainers need to be paid, but they end up saying the same thing every workout anyway because there is no variation in the workout to give them things to talk about! A computer could randomly string together the phrases for a \"new\" workout. I wanted to support the devs, but the price point doesn't return enough on the investment and I'd feel like a sucker. If I take the $179 and buy other fitness apps, I'd have tons more variety in my workout. Where's a personalized workout plan? Where is there any variety? (I get sick of Beat Saber and stop playing it for months, and that has more variety than this app.) The data given at the end of a workout doesn't mean anything to me - Supernatural should take the info and build something for me instead of giving me a line graph I don't care about. It takes you to beautiful locations that are all repetitive 3D stock photos and never gives you a chance to even look at your surrounding. I'm ready to come back to this app, but they need to do something for me to pay for ANOTHER subscription (I'm subscription weary).\n\nHelpful | 5", "unhedgedMay 11 at 11:18 AM\nGood aerobics but...\n\nThe concept and intent are excellent. Can certainly make aerobic exercise more interesting. Its definitely in its infancy in terms of its depth and breadth of offering. I can really see the potential when its fully realized, but it is not there for 19.95 per month. Putting Beat Saber on the higher difficulty gets 75% of the benefit.\nWould i pay 240/year for nicer VR locales and some human coaching? Maybe if there were other forms of work out in the program, and it was shareable.\nIts simply hard to imagine many people paying 40/month in order to allow ones partner to shate the Oculus and have their own user profile since right now only one allowed.\nFor an early stage beta concept with so e potential, 480/ year per couple is just not going to work. Other services, Peloton etc offer workouts across multiple formats and in a myriad of ways.\nSupernatural is essentially one exercise with different music. Thats not 40/month per couple. So...\nMy advice would be to price this at the beta level it is until there is to s more content and choice and it allows for at least 2 users\nGreat concept, looks good, but limited and overpriced for now.

I often go in for one workout and stay for two. It's a great way to move if I haven't had time to get outside and do some \"real\" exercise.\n\n2. As far as exercise goes - it does get my heart rate up, but only to around 115 bpm. Unfortunately, my heart rate tracker (a Fitbit) isn't supported by the app, so I have to check my watch between songs. In comparison, I've gotten up to 130 bmp on Box VR. I wouldn't use the app to replace regular exercise, but it's definitely better than nothing. And, it's fun, so I'm motivated to use it.\n\nUPDATE: I actually got up to 155 bpm during my Supernatural workout yesterday. I find that the better I get at using the program, the better a workout I'm able to get.\n\n3. I love the backgrounds! Some are so realistic that I practically feel like I could reach down and touch the water. Nearly each time I've played, there's been a new place to go. This variety and the beauty keeps me coming back, more so than any other exercise app. Really hope the company makes it a priority to keep adding new locations.\n\n4. I actually like the fact that I can't choose specific songs or places, just workouts. This means I'm basically in for a surprise and it takes away the stress of having to decide.\n\n5. The music, in my opinion, is not great. I'd like it if the workouts were organized by genre, so that I could at least select workouts that were more likely to have music I like. I'm in the process of trying to figure out if a particular coach has similar tastes in music to me.\n\nIs it worth $19 a month? That does seem expensive compared to other games, but on the other hand, it's way less than one dinner out and a lot healthier. I'm inclined to jump on the annual sale they're offering until the end of May, which makes the price a bit more palatable. I can't be sure it will still grab my attention months down the road, but I like what the company has done and want them to stay in business.\n\nHelpful | 8", "Ronlybonly10 days ago\n\nSo much fun!

The picturesque environments, pro trainers and pre-built workouts are a good way to replace a gym membership. However, I would really like to see some improvements. Namely, allow the user to create some workouts for themselves. I would also like the opportunity to take an existing workout that you have created and add songs to it. The next and more important improvement... please add time at the beginning of new songs before the orbs start coming because the beginning of each song always has the worst tracking. The entire rest of each song tracks me and the controllers perfectly, but the first 5 seconds always goes wacky. Please just don't start the orbs until 8 seconds into each new song and problem solved.\n\nEDIT: If you stay very still the tracking works pretty well even in the beginning, but I would still like to see them start the targets a few seconds later in each song. It would also give the added benefit of giving us time to enjoy the beautiful scenary.\n\nHelpful | 10\nDeveloper ResponseJun 6 at 4:21 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for the review, glad to hear you've been enjoying your Supernatural fitness experience.

I was skeptical at first because of the price, but after working up a sweat playing beat saber I wanted to at least try the free month to see how much harder I could push myself.\n\nAfter the first day, I dug out my old fitness tracker to track my progress (which motivated me even more).

Mostly bought it because I had seen the promo for this exercise game. I'm in my 40s, overweight, and I could barely walk after the first workout because of the squatting and... I loved it. Now that I've played a dozen times...\n\nBeginners: How there is only one workout labelled as beginner is beyond me. I tried some others, those that are marked as automatic or dynamic to your performance. Wayyyy too difficult. Hint to developpers: if I fail the beginning of the workout within 20 seconds, I'm frustrated and quit.\n\n6-12-20 Update: Thanks to the developer for responding. I did try the (L) low intensity workouts and it's incredible how music can make or break motivation. I didn't care for the music selection in those workouts and lacked the desire to do well and I just ended up quitting before reaching the end.\n\nTriangles. I've already brought this up on 2 various occasions, once directly with the company. First, give me the option to turn it off for a workout and second, make it obvious when you successfully go through one. The visual effect when you go through seems to be some sort of backward reverberation in the same white outline but with a fading effect. In my mind, that's the effect I would expect to see when you FAIL to go through. It's just confusing and I really don't know on occasion if I fail to go through them or not.\n\nLastly, there should be a demonstration on how to tackle multiple side lunges. I know how to do them, but I don't know how to switch position quickly from a right side lunge to a left within the space of 0.5 second. I would like to see how someone else does this so that I can learn from them because I don't get it.

You really have to pay attention to your form and putting real effort into smashing the targets. Id like to see the developer make this a bit more challenging by adding in different movement patterns that dont rely so much on squats and lunges. For example, you could add a section where youre on the mat on your back and sit up or push up through a target. You could add planks, where you hold through a long target, etc. So far the free trial has been good. I really like Raneirs workouts. Will I shell out the $179 annual fee? Probably.

Would I pay 20/m?\n\nI pay $100/mo on specialty gym so money is not an issue IF value matches it. That said, would I pay $20/mo for this?\n\nFirst of, it's actually not as bad as others mentioned here. Let go of the Beat Saber mindset and you'll see what it truly is after a couple of sessions. It's not just a rhythm game but a wholistic workout. You can get a good workout equivalent to roughly 1/4 the intensity of a group class in a nice gym. Pro mode will get you that full intensity and more.\n\nThe environments are near equivalent of the realistic environments of VR Fishing, though missing the nice subtleties that make it an awestrucking experience. It is a nice bonus.\n\nHowever, the relaxing environments are ruined by the tone of the coaches. I don't know whether this was thoroughly tested because the discrepancy is quite large. I'd like to be able to focus on my workout with great beats on awe inducing environments and a coach that gives me a good time that I'd like to hang out with daily. Ability to vary coach comments frequency would be nice.\n\nIn fact, just turn it off. It's impossible for me to get in a flow state with the coaches tone/voice.\n\nAdditionally, this has crashed a few times and tracking is quite bad. I get S in Beat Saber and near 100% with BoxVR so there's something off here.\n\nI pay near $100/mo on a specialty gym so I don't mind paying for value.\n\nThis one however, to me would be around $5.99 a month. I don't mind paying 9.99 IF the developers add awe strucking and breath taking experiences like being near a waterfall or on top of a sky scraper or on clouds and add more songs, ability to manually choose as well as more common harder difficulty nearing expert mode or more of beat saber. At $20/mo, its value is not matched. We'll see what happens in 30 days regarding updates, content, pivoting changes, etc. If little to no additions, I'm out since BoxVR provides heck of a lot more value, workouts, songs, fun and intensity. I sweat more, focus more, and get in the zone better, actually reach the flow state with BoxVR and Beat Saber. Not so with this unfortunately.\n\nI'm concerned that $20/mo is just the starter price. Not even CLOSE worth that. I understand that developers put a lot of work, time, money, etc based on replies but effort does not equal value. Any more than 9.99/mo and this will push many. At this CURRENT state, it's probably between 4.99 to 7.99 tops. More environment, gameplay fixes, feedback on actions, multiplayer, songs and giving me the flow state and powerful feeling I get when playing beat saber, then 9.99 might be worth it. ONLY way I'll pay 20/mo if I can actually talk to real coaches for accountability, tips, motivation, keeping me on track etc.\n\nHelpful | 60\nDeveloper ResponseApr 25 at 1:02 PM\n\nHello, thank you for taking the time to write us with so much detailed feedback.

Literally every day.\n\nThis isnt for everyone, and for those who dont like the monthly subscription (and admittedly its not cheap), I get it. If I were using this as a casual game, I certainly wouldnt pay a subscription fee to use it. And yet, I wound up buying an annual subscription, and I think its money well spent . . . primarily because Im getting a great workout, and I love the music.\n\nI love playing games, and I play them often, but I use this program as my daily workout routine. Now that theyve been up and running for a while, theres a good amount of content with good variety. Best of all, they seem to be pretty responsive to constructive criticism and the program continually improves.\n\nFor example, I *hated* the dynamic intensity feature, where it would get harder or easier based on your performance. More often than not (like almost all the time), Id wind up flailing around trying to hit projectiles that seemed to come out of nowhere. Thats not much fun. But then new content started arriving, and instead of a bunch of dynamic intensity workouts, I began seeing low-intensity, medium-intensity, and high-intensity workouts. I love being able to switch things up by doing a low-intensity workout, concentrating on my form and the power of my movements, then the next day switch to a medium-intensity workout where Im more focused on speed of movement.\n\nThe music selection is very good, and I love working out to music that I recognize . . . and even some of the music that is new to me sometimes becomes a new favorite. (Developerssome 70s music, please!)\n\nFor the person looking for gaming, Id look elsewhere. The cost of this just isnt work that, imo. On the other hand, if youre looking for an engaging and fun workout, you should try it out. I love that they offer a full month free so that you can really experience it.

My style of music is very much remote from whatever they play in the game so that's not really an issue for me. I do find it easier to hit the targets when you know the song so you can anticipate the rhythm. I like that the sessions are labeled so I know that I should avoid the hard ones for now. I'm pleased with the number of workouts available for now but I could see how someone who's starting to get back into shape would feel like they are replaying the same easy ones over and over again. Perhaps having the same workouts and voices for everyone but each workout can be played at all of the 3 difficulty levels? I like that there's an actual human being during the warm-up and cool down.

My legs are sore to a degree unmatched by other quest titles like Beat Saber and BoxVR.\n\nI understand 19$ per month may be a steep fee for some but this experience offered more in my opinion than other titles available.\n\nThere are 6 workouts each day that have different intensity levels from beginner to pro with additional \"relaxed\" and \"tough\" options added. Each workout lasts about 20 minutes with little time to rest during. The \"coaches\" talk during the workouts and did hype me up I won't lie.\n\nSongs varied from ones that seemed to be built for this application to popular hits from Jet, Lady Gaga, and One Republic (to list a few examples).\n\nLastly the scenery is nothing shy of perfection.

Music needs to be varied more. I found myself really getting the best workout with Retrofit......because I know the music....it doesn't stop me from doing the other workouts and I find myself liking songs I didn't know existed but with that price --- you need to appeal to more folks. It also wouldn't hurt that with Synth Riders each Sunday they do an event with others lead by one person. So you get the feeling of being in a class but not driving there, have to park, then drive sweaty home. Plus you are not comparing yourself to others. It it just good comraderie. I never write reviews, the only reason I am here is because I want to see this startup make it.\n\nUPDATE: I pulled the trigger and went for the yearly, after I noticed they have added more Retro play lists.

We'll definitely have more Retrofit workouts and more Ranier, glad you're enjoying them. Check out the icons next to the workouts (L, M, or H), these indicate the intensity level of each workout.

I would like to have an annual membership, but I am not sure if I could continuously play it for a whole year. During the past 30 days, I almost played it every day. This app designed workouts in a smart way. Everyday we have different workouts so that we will not get bored day after day. In addition, for each workout, it also includes warm-up and cool down. The most attractive part of this app to me is that we could travel to beautiful scenery while doing excises. I love this app but have some suggestions:\n\n1. could we add more beautiful places of the world to the app? I am a little bit tired of seeing the same places day after day and would like to discover some new places.\n\n2. So far, almost all the workouts are less than 30 mins. Could we have some workouts for advanced level users? I plan to use this as a substitute for my gym and hope I could have a full workout with this app. Thanks!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 25 at 7:58 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback.

I enjoyed the music, the trainers and the environments (which are stunning). Im not sure if its the best workout but I was sweating hard after my first day (40 minutes) and Im a very active person (or was before the plague).\n\nI had a few concerns similar to those that I read in reviews:\n\n1. The monthly fee. Just like everyone else, Im not sold on this. I know this is the trend with at home workout services, but I didnt buy into those and it would be a tough to sell me on this. Id be a lot more comfortable with an up front fee. This is really the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review.\n\n2. The trainers talking over the entire workout. I will tell you that it didnt bother me the way that this bothered others. I will also tell you that I picked up ring fit adventure on release day and have done it every other day for 6 months. After listening to that annoying character for so long, these trainers were a breath of fresh air.\n\nI did see that there was now an option to turn trainer volume all the way down now. I dont know if that was a recent update but its there if the trainers really are a problem.\n\n3. I was concerned about using my quest as a workout tool (Im sweaty), but I just got an email from supernatural letting me know that they are sending a complimentary sweat guard for my headset. That is really freaking cool.\n\nIm planning on giving this 30 days. I dont think I will keep it up with the monthly fee, but I will give it an honest shot.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI kept my word and gave this an honest shot and, honestly, really enjoyed it. Im not changing my starred review because I do feel the app to be a solid 4. It works great, its got good music, the scenery is still stunning and I genuinely enjoyed most of the trainers. Bonus points for the Supernatural team sending me a free face guard for my oculus within a few days. That was super cool and super impressive.\n\nThe cons are mostly minor. Sometimes I feel like the target placements dont make sense and break the immersion. Or I just suck. Either way, extremely minor point.\n\nThe elephant in the room is obviously still the price. The developers are running a special for a deep discount right now and I was planning on picking it up. However, Ive also just found out that my position was terminated due to the plague. So now I cant.\n\nI genuinely like this app and recommend to anyone interested to give it a fair shot. You may really like what you find. Im planning on jumping back in once I find a new job.\n\nHelpful | 5", "bolesjbJul 1 at 11:58 AM\nTake a little time, and fall in love.\n\nI'm going to start this review by saying Supernatural isn't perfect, but it is an unusual stretch of the VR fitness approach that merits 5 stars. There's a certain polish here that is entirely unique, and makes for a really high end quality immersion in the experience. I entered into Supernatural with a lot of ambivalence about the monthly subscription. In fact, maybe it wasn't ambivalence - I couldn't even imagine that I would sign on. The first work out had me interested in the platform, and made me do enough of a second take that I thought maybe I'd explore with a trial subscription. But then COVID-19 had my wife and kids at home, and Supernatural actually has a pretty viable approach to lower body activity that is adaptive for whatever level of fitness you're at. Regardless of what you invest, the approach encourages active lower body participation to a degree that the obstacles in BoxVR and elsewhere do not.\n\nBoxVR is a good comparison, as that is the other fitness activity among my family. BoxVR creates an upperbody experience that Supernatural doesn't approach, and consequently that's an area for my feedback. Some of the upper body activity in Supernatural seems to try too hard. All of the activity consists of striking black and white spheres in different directions with sweeping movements. And I think that is one of the biggest limitations, and where I have requests:\n1) There perhaps should be a punch or some other type of movement that creates more rapid aerobic activity than is possible with the swings.\n2) At advanced levels, moves come on too fast without intro. May be instructor coaching area - left hand over shoulder strike after this squat! Option to repeat last track with speed change.\n3) The black and white balls are too hard to visually identify over the background (especially depth perception, and especially when closely staggered). Color scheme please.\n\nOverall, awesome extension to other fitness choices. Worth the monthly sub.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJul 1 at 6:41 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback. Very cool to hear that you gave us a shot and ended up really enjoying your Supernatural workouts. Thanks for the feedback on the movements, it's something that we've heard from others in the Supernatural community and something that we'll continue to explore for future updates. We're working on an enhancement that should make the targets easier to identify in certain landscapes so definitely look out for that.

I own Beat Saber, ToTF, and Box VR and all are great workouts in their own way. The problem is I get tired of doing the same songs/workouts everyday and there is nothing fresh to keep me coming back - so I dont. I like the idea behind this of being able to wake up each day to a new workout waiting for me using songs that I recognize vs random techno music or paying for a track pack containing 5 songs that I burn through and grow tired of quickly.\n\nThe workout I did today was great - I love the heart rate zone breakdown as well. My average heart rate during the workout today was in the 150s and I hit a maximum in the 180s! Needless to say I was gassed afterwards. I also found it to be different than beat saber as it was more geared towards fully completing the movements vs hitting the targets using just your wrists.\n\nI dont agree with the other reviewers slamming this just because of the price. The review should be off of gameplay since they give you 30 days to try it before you have to pay anything. If you dont like it after that point - just dont pay for it and maybe the monthly price will drop in the future. Do I wish the price was cheaper each month? For sure. Will I pay for it due to the high price once my trial is up? Not sure yet as I will see how it goes the next 30 days. However, I understand the need to have a subscription based model for how they are doing this. My wife is an aerobics instructor and its the same model they have to use due to the licensing costs of using current music and the ongoing costs of having to come up with new choreography/content each day.\n\nIf you prefer to just buy a game and use it as is for a workout each day, that is great, that works for you and there are many great games like that. However, this is trying to be something different to appeal to those who love VR workouts, but get tired of the repetition - which unfortunately requires ongoing costs. Will it work as currently priced? Not sure, but I do like the idea and think it is a great game/workout to try out for yourself at no cost!\n\nHelpful | 47", "innerdimJun 5 at 2:28 PM\nGood UI, Good workout, Useless features.\n\nPros:\nUI is awesome.\nI got a full body workout while playing it.\n\nUseless:\nTrainers don't really add to the game and sometimes remind you that you're working out.\n\nNew workout everyday. I don't care. I can do the same workout 20 or so times before it get's old. It's fun to try to get better at a routine.\n\nTons of pop music. There's literally millions unknown artists that would let you use their music for dirt cheap. This music does't always match with the scenery. Sometimes the workout routines don't match to the music. In other rhythm games I love playing to songs I've never heard.\n\nCons:\n19 a month, most likely because of the music licensing and trainers, in my opinion both don't add to the game.\n\nYou can't select one song at a time or the difficulty. The fun thing about other rhythm games is doing the same song over and over and getting better at the song.\n\nYou also have to put down your headset and go on your phone to sign up.\n\nConclusion:\nThis should be relaunched with just 10 songs and minimal trainers without a subscription based model. As is, this may have a niche market, but the quest doesn't have a broad enough user base to make this successful.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJun 6 at 3:56 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for your feedback and the kind words on the UI.

The sweat cover came and it's much better than the one I had!\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if the algorithm caught up or what, but the maps are more doable now and still challenge me. The triangles are still tricky and I can't tell if I \"made\" it or not. Could continue to work on map flow and the triangle piece, but I'm overall happy with this game and would continue it after the trial period. Thanks!\n\n...\nThis review doesn't take into account the cost, which has been covered ad nauseum by others. Frankly, I actually don't mind the cost so long as there's value. The sweat liner is a great touch. The experience is great too. I am loving the scenery and the coaches. The gameplay is what I think could use the most improvement: (1) make the orbs stand out a little more (different color) because sometimes i have a hard time seeing them on certain backgrounds. (2) flow can be improved, there are some awkward movements (3) can you make the different triangles shapes more distinct? (Again, different colors, for different shapes?) I find it hard to tell them apart at the speeds they are going. Also how low do you need to go to make it through the triangle? (4) I find the \"reward\" of making it through the triangle or hitting an orb to be lackluster. Can you make some sort of more emphasized feedback? Today was my first day playing and I went into this completely willing to pay, but I just didn't have a ton of FUN after the awe of the scenery quickly wore off. I think with these very minor tweaks I would look forward to more sessions.\n\nHelpful | 3", "25penniesJun 9 at 6:37 AM\nTotal workout!\n\nI really enjoy this app!

I find that the low impact workouts are the best for me (the more advanced ones make me a little dizzy) and they get my heart rate up for 20 min a day, and the next day I am SORE.

This feels like the beginning of a new future.\n\nHelpful | 5", "BunandBeanMay 31 at 2:35 AM\nExcellent Workout\n\nI waited until my 30 day trial was up to review this. The reason why I waited 30 days to review is because I tend to lose enthusiasm easily and I have never kept up a constant workout past 30 days which I was able to do with Supernatural.\n\nI'm one of those people that pays for a gym membership and hire a personal trainer only to lose momentum within a month. In fact, any sort of workout including playing VR games like Beatsaber, BoxVR, etc can't keep my interest for more than a couple weeks. Most of it has to do with the amount of time I have to put in to get a good workout and the other is I hate exercising period (even if I know it's good for me). Like a lot of people $20/month/person subscription sounds ridiculous to me even with the music assets, environment assets, trainers, building/maintaining game, etc ($149/year offer is still a bit steep but more understandable). Because of price, I almost didn't give this a shot but I did because of this whole pandemic thing and I am glad I did.\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed that this game could get me to sweat as much as I did when I had a personal trainer but I can also complete a workout within 15-20 min and not ask myself why I'm paying for misery. Most of the time I was so pre-occupied with striking everything with power and accuracy that I didn't really have the time to think about how tired I was feeling or how much I hate exercise. Yes, Beatsaber is a lot like this game but it is also very different from this game. I like having a curated playlist so I know I'm getting a well rounded workout. I also like that they incorporated squats and lunges so I have a lower body workout too. I love the warm-ups and cool down stretches and I even wish the stretches lasted a little longer. I always neglect doing stretches after a workout because I don't know where to start. I also like the auto intensity, it keeps the workout just over what I think my abilities are without making it feel impossible and want to quit (sometimes it does feel impossible but it doesn't happen much). Initially I thought sweating so much from playing this was because I'm so out of shape so I had my husband try this game out too and he was sweating up a storm (even more than me) and he is much more in shape than I am. Both of us were sore the next day. What I have come to realize after doing this trial is that you get what you put into these workouts. It can be as easy or as difficult as you want them to be which is amazing.\n\nThat said, I would suggest some improvements such as Fitbit integration, family plan, more stretches, more genres of music, fixing some maps (sometimes they don't feel very intuitive and sometimes maps don't match what the trainer is saying), more real world environments (less fantasy environments), custom playlist (maybe select from a list of songs/maps for a certain kind of workout goal to make it still feel curated but custom too).\n\nI can see myself keeping this up so I will definitely be keeping this subscription and looking forward to new features.\n\nHelpful | 8", "jimwidemanMay 30 at 8:32 PM\nImproving\n\nGive it time people just added a couple more tracks for us 50 year olds.

I managed to crack one of my controllers on the first go in the space that I usually play Beat Saber just fine in.\nIt really is a good workout though! My glutes were so sore the next day which was nice to see that I had worked hard but I'm not sure that everyone is active enough to handle doing that many squats in short succession. It also tricks me into enjoying cardio which I usually hate so that's a big selling feature to me.\nI absolutely love the scenery, especially Iceland, and wish there was an option to stay in them for longer and cooldown more or stretch. I'm also glad that there's the option to turn down the voice of the trainers. Even in typical workout classes I find trainers more annoying than motivating.\nI understand that the price point is probably a reflection of having trainers, good quality graphics, and current music, but it's going to take some thought before I sign onto $19/month.\n\nHelpful | 7", "TomG123414 days ago\nA great app.\n\nGetting healthier every day, with complete enjoyment.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response16 days ago\n\nThanks for the feedback, glad you've been enjoying your Supernatural fitness experience.

Most of my workouts happen in the gym, whether it be at my college or when I'm in my hometown for the holidays. Supernatural has given me a way to enjoy being at home while also achieving my goals of growing stronger and leaner. While it does have its hiccups here and here (it's a VR app, and a brand-new one at that, at the end of the day), it's been one of my greatest sources of entertainment in this quarantine.

I subscribed vowing to cancel my subscription when I inevitably stopped using it after a week.\nBut have surprised myself by sticking with it for a month. I've tried many of the active games on Quest, and Supernatural is the most intense: way more intense than beat saber. It's a great deal easier to put on a headset than to work going to a gym into your schedule, even before considering the ongoing pandemic. And with many of us stuck at home the need for staying active is greater than ever.

I am more fit than when I started playing. That said, I don't know how good it would be if you're not able to do 15-20 of moderate cardio, or have never played a beat saber style game.\n\nI'm giving it a 5 even though there are some shortcomings, but the team has been improving the app, and it's still new, so I think they deserve a little extra credit.\n\nFirst the good:\nThe music selection is solid, a wiiiide range from EDM, to Rap, to classic rock, to R&B. Some songs work better than others.\nI love that there is a new workout every day. It hasn't felt stale at all. I was skeptical of the subscription pricing, but if they keep putting out a new workout everyday, they can have my money.\nThe instructors are actually nice to have. I was skeptical about having some overenthusiastic coach shouting in my ear, but the reminders they drop during the songs and the encouragement is actually pretty useful. I definitely catch myself fixing my form after Leanne says to engage that core!\nThe heart rate monitor integration is fun data.\nThe social app is also surprisingly ok, I thought that would be nonsense, but it's been fun to note how I did and see how my couple of friends are doing.\n\nNow the bad:\nAs some reviews have noted, the feedback on the targets is too weak. I've struggled to consistently land 'power' hits though I do usually have 99% accuracy, so that is possible.\nI'm also an avid beat saber player, I'm pretty comfortable sight reading hard and most expert songs, so Supernatural's target rhythms aren't challenging (the cardio and the squats are). So if you don't have much experience with a target slashing game, I could see being frustrated. You can't fail a workout, so those targets just keep coming.\nI don't think there is a practice mode, so perfecting a sequence would be tough, but the workout is the point, not the score.\n\nHelpful | 9", "docmomtiredAFJun 26 at 9:58 AM\nGreat to get you moving!\n\nBought this so I could do something to keep moving when traveling during the pandemic.

Would you rather spend money on a $700 - $3000 Bowflex gym that, lets be honest, will turn into the worlds more expensive hanger for a lot of us after 6 months or play this game and get some good exercise over the glaciers of Iceland. With that said, I do remain skeptical. I am hoping that the game does expand into a lot more than what we see in the trailers, like yoga, meditation,  30 minute stretching exercises, etc. I already saw an ad for meditation, so that is promising that they are going to expand. So I am going to try out the 30 day trial and see what I feel/think each week.\n**First Week**\nMy first time playing was not a good first impression. The game gives you some good tutorials but then kind of drops you into picking a workout. No real explanation I can remember on the different levels or any recommended workouts for first time players. I mistakenly picked a high end workout and well there is a reason I got this game, I not fit at all. So this first work really kicked my butt and was demotivating. Got me thinking, I am so unfit that I cant even play this game right.\n\nSo I would recommend putting some recommended workouts for first time players to help ease them on in. Next, the stretching montage they do at the end of each workout should be longer than 30 seconds, we should go through two or three minutes of a cool down stretching.\n\nHowever, outside of all of this I stuck to it for the rest of the week, I grew to really like the workouts once I figured out the level of the workout. I thought the coach recordings over the music would get annoying but they dont, however I think it should be an option to turn that off, not sure everyone wants that. That aside, I love what the coaches say, they really get you motivate. There were some points in the game that I was struggling to keep up and the things the coaches start really pumped me up and pushed me to keep going.\n\nI love the  scenery that they take you to. The places are gorgeous, its not some 360 degree picture, their is depth and you feel like you are there. However, I would like it if they would say the same of the place. I think only a few times they say the name of the place but I would like it said the name every time. Some of these places they take us to, I have better luck at winning the lottery than pronouncing them correctly. The game really gets you to want to get up and go to some of these places.\n\nOverall, I think I had a great first week. The game did what it was suppose to, gave me a great work out, a great sweat, I didnt feel judged like I do in the gym and made me realize how stairs are your enemy after a workout... I look forward to the rest of the month.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 11 at 5:24 PM\n\nHey there - thanks so much for the detailed review/feedback and congratulations on completing your first week of Supernatural. Thanks for the suggestions regarding recommended workouts for beginners as well as your suggestion about longer stretching sessions.

It crushes all the other workout apps out there and brings another level of high-quality personalized training. 20 minutes in the most epic locations will delete your stress, give you the cardio and energy you need for the day. I'm looking forward to experiencing more content with premium music and grow my battling skills.\n\nPricing is fair for the high-quality bar, dynamic sessions, and pro trainers. Especially when compared to what most gym and workout classes cost today.\n\nHelpful | 43", "stevebougApr 24 at 6:54 PM\nBest gym alternative!\n\nJust got this game and tried out a few workouts and it's awesome. The game was fully calibrated to my height, squat height and lunge height, so it's fully customized to me. The workout is composed of a warm up, a few songs so you get a few seconds to recover between each, and ends with a cool down. There is a trainer guiding you the whole time and giving you super useful cues. I've been training for years and this game has still got me sweating hard, lol, so be sure to keep a towel near by! So far, this has been my favorite quarantine alternative to the gym.\n\nAlso, I find it unfair that people have given this game a low rating just because of the fee. Unlike other quest \"workout\" games that have a one time fee, this game has a new workout every day, so I get that you pay a subscription because they keep adding content. Also, the way I see it, I pay 20$ for the month, if I like it and it works for me I keep going and it's worth every penny (much cheaper than a gym membership), if not, I stop, and it just cost me $20... If you think about it, most good quest games cost more than $20 and you never play for more than a week.

Gets my heart rate much higher -definitely a full body workout.\nI hesitated at first about the $19 monthly subscription- thought no way. But how much is a personal trainer? About $40-$70 an hour! I can have personal trainers every day for only $19 a MONTH?

The first time I used it I had no idea how much core strength I was using it took a few days to recover. It really has helped me. It makes squats lunges and movement feel fun and natural. Reminds me a lot of being in aerobic class but from my home which is great given this pandemic. I am really enjoying it. I dont like that its a subscription but if they continue to come out with new and engaging content so it isnt the same thing all the time Ill stick with it!

Squats and lunges SHOULD be done with really right technique, otherwise they are killing your joints. But what technique we are talking about if you trying to reach a target on front of you that are changing fast and in the meantime doing multiple of fast squats and lunges and trying to change a direction? I'm not the novice, but just after a few days I feel my knees hurt.\nAnother thing is the app underestimate the importance of warm up and cool down. Few stretches are seriously NOT enough before The intense workout.\nFor I don't know what reason few times I had issues with calibration - suddenly the floor became too high or to low when I pause the workout for example to drink a water, and there is no possible way to change that incide the workout (and honestly, even in the settings it's too long and boring).\nPros - I am really sweating while doing that, I love the environments and feel that the experience is more calorie-burning then Beat Saber (but more boring).\nHonestly, having no gym these days and with all this heat outside I was considering the subscription. But for that price - too much cons.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 23 at 8:57 AM\n\nHi there - thank you for the note. As you know, Supernatural offers workouts at a variety of intensity levels: Low, Medium, and High. If the squats and lunges are feeling too deep during the workouts, try heading over to the Settings menu and recalibrating your squats and lunges to a depth thats more comfortable for you. As with any form of exercise, we recommend consulting with your doctor first before deciding which Supernatural workout would be right for you. If you haven't already, please also check out our Supernatural Pro Tips segment on the Supernatural Companion App or on our Youtube channel.

We're working on some upgrades to the Companion App experience also so stay tuned.", "bdroc4096May 15 at 9:58 AM\nGreat start, needs pricing flexibility\n\nBeat Saber released a song called BeatFit that was a ton of fun because it forced you to use your whole body. I wanted more of that and found out that this exists. Most of the songs have been fun too, and I know very few of them. That said, popular music can be very polarizing and the asking price of 20 bucks a month is too inflexible for how high it is.\n\nFor music, I'd like to see groups or bands that no one has heard of. There's a ton of incredible undiscovered music out there that would fit really well with this game. A lot of popular music is already saturated to the point of exhaustion and its probably very expensive to license. The well known songs are a good selling point but there aren't a ton of popular songs I'm dying to hear more of.\n\nFor price, I get it, it's much smarter to start where you want to be and scale down if you need to than to start low and then bring up the price, aggravating your active customers. This is however, a game on a gaming platform. Not many people are buying Quests FOR fitness, the fitness part is a bonus. A great bonus, but it shouldn't be confused for a Peloton.\n\nI will probably try at least a month of paid because I'm going to get at least that value out of the trial and it's extremely fun, but I think they should offer other plans in addition, such as letting you continue to access the game with a \"paused\" subscription for several months. Maybe pausing restricts the content, such as new workouts and new songs and expiring songs. When someone gets bored or want something new, they can unpause for however long. Whatever it may be, there is probably a way to bridge the gap of the people who want to enjoy this as an excellent rhythm/workout game, and the people who are inserting this into their lifestyle. I hope that balance can be found.\n\nAll of that out of the way, I have to say, these guys are on to something. For me, it's song for song more fun than beat saber, it gets me active and moving. I'm not as focused on hitting every note as I am making sure I'm using every muscle. Definitely looking forward to how this app grows moving forward.\n\nHelpful | 4", "sopranolinistMay 15 at 11:10 AM\nGreat app but needs improvement\n\nI've been playing for a week and I am already a convert!\n\nPros:\n* new workout every day - obviously this is a huge selling point to keep things from getting stale\n* I love that it has a lower body component, this is a huge plus over Beat Saber\n* I love the views - it's a great way to feel like I'm actually outside instead of stuck in the house all day\n* The trainers are a nice personal touch, I like that they don't talk as much as your average gym instructor, just a bit from time to time to help me refocus\n* Auto-intensity is a great way to keep the workout calibrated to my own fitness level\n\nCons:\n* White orbs are sometimes difficult to see against clouds, snow, ice etc.\n* Price point - $19/month is fairly steep for only 1 new workout a day. I locked myself in at the $149/yr rate but still I would like to see more varied content for that amount of money\n* More focus on legs. I know it's hard to do anything without some sort of leg controller/band, but I would like something other than squats and lunges. I can see some form of jumping working - can you track the vertical position of the headset to see if the user is jumping over some sort of virtual obstacle? With the right obstacle & orb pattern you might be able to incorporate jumping jacks.\n* There are times when I find myself trying to keep up with a ton of orbs and then I forget to squat or my lunges have poor form. I get a better workout with fewer orbs in fewer complicated patterns, because then I don't have to focus on figuring out the next pattern and I can instead concentrate on proper form. If this is going to be a fitness app, the focus should be on getting a good workout not hitting as many orbs as possible. This isn't Squat Saber. Obviously this a challenge because part of the workout score is the number of orbs you hit correctly. Maybe incorporate an accuracy measure that gives you a higher score if you hit the orb right in the center of the target as opposed to slightly off center?\n\nHelpful | 4", "seven-of-nineMay 24 at 6:58 AM\nNeeds work, could be great.\n\nI have used this for over a week now. I think this could be a fantastic platform for getting fit, and I love the integration of squats and lunges.\n\nHowever, I agree with many reviews that it has its shortcomings. Here is what Id like to see:\n\n1. Being able to skip/mute the narrator. Sometimes I just want to enjoy the music without any additional talking, especially when Ive played a playlist before.\n\n2. More retro songs. This is something Ive been missing in many of these games. LOVE that theyve added more retro themed playlists. The 80s one was great. The funk one was awesome. More more more!\n\n3. Scalable difficulty. I would love to be able to choose easy/medium/hard for any given song or workout. The medium and hard are often too fast paced and then I cant actually get a good workout and get nice and low in my squats and lunges.\n\nEdit 5/24: I updated my review to 4 stars because theyre delivering on the retro playlists (the most recent 80s playlist was banger). Keep them coming! Also, noticed some new backgrounds yesterday. Kind of wish I could pick which scenery I want... I never want to leave the purple forest. Its beautiful! Im a 30/f who isnt really into current tunes, so I am LOVING all the 80s/funk/retro playlists. Great mixes, devs!

It's like playing Beat Saber but with a purpose. Basically this is a guided workout plan that had you using virtual bats to strike targets, while you squat or lunge to the left or right. The coaches are really motivating and help to guide you through the different workouts very effectively, and the music is pretty darn good too!\n\nDon't let the fact that it is posted as \"free\" in the Oculus store and then prompts you to subscribe either monthly or annually discourage you. Nothing is truly free. As of now it's $19 monthly or $179 annually, after a 30-day free trial. If your goal is to use this daily as a personal workout program as I intend to I'd say that's pretty reasonable, actually.

The first thing that will stand out to people is the $20 / month fee. Understand that you are paying for personal training services that implement modern technology. Your first month is free and you can cancel any time. Between the work that goes into providing content and the technical maintenance, the fee is incredibly generous.\n\nThat couldn't be said of the workouts sucked. They don't. Unlike Beat Saber the arm movements are designed to keep you moving rather than focusing on your score. If you mess up the round doesn't end. You keep moving. The workout I did was very squat intensive and my heart rate was up the entire time.\n\nI like all of the trainers as well.

I am 62 years old and have always embraced fitness. I have owned my own gym, taught Tae Kwon Do, ran marathons, ultra-marathons, and do cross-fit.\nOver the years I have gotten burned out on workouts. Do not get me wrong, I still work out. I force myself to, except when it comes to Supernatural; I love the workouts! I look forward to them and will often do one supernatural workout, take a short break, and do another.\nThe workouts use popular music (not just techno), beautiful locations and coaches that are encouraging. My heart rate gets revved up plenty for fitness, while I break a sweat and use a wide range of motion. I have been doing the workouts for over a month now. I bought the membership and since I use it each day, rather than going to a gym, I more than get my moneys worth.\nSupernatural is a great gym alternative and I enjoy the workouts! Give it a try.

Great music, a total body workout, and new content regularly. Everyone noting the high price is totally right, but for me, it's worth it if they can fix a few things.\n\nThe game is still in its first month, and it is doing a good job of rotating in different music styles. If they keep building that diversity, that'll be amazing. I don't see many of the 2000s artists in the mix yet, which is too badwhere are the pop giants of the recent days past like Foo Fighters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, Britney Spears, Dr. Dre, etc.?\n\nThe workout is great, better than Beat Saber (though the new-ish Beat Fit map is great). I really appreciate that. I would like to see a bit more variety in moves, though.\n\nThe areas that need improvement are just a few. First, the heartrate monitor options seem too limited. Why isn't FitBit charge in the mix? I don't really want to buy a separate monitor.\n\nMany of the move indicator differences are pretty subtle, too. The difference between a slight lunge and squat is hard to see. There's no clear indicator that you have two different orbs to hit in the row, left and right, instead of a double-hit of both at once. These could be made clearerthe game should be about making the moves, not guessing what move is called for.\n\nLastly, the price is high. I'll probably buy the annual membership, but I worry many will quit at even that. Music packs are a good way to solve this. And once you have 100 different workouts on there, do you really need a new one daily?\n\nThis is a great game. I love it.

One the one hand, it was a little different having the coaches talk while I was exercising (see the title of this review) and it seemed like a really pretty version of Beat Saber. But 40 minutes later as I was gasping for air in what I thought were the final moments of my life, I realized that it was the best workout I had experienced using the Oculus but with none of the awkward human interaction and locker room smell that comes with an actual gym! I was hooked. The more I used it, the more I warmed to the coaches during the workouts. Why? Because the feedback actually starts to feel constructive after a while and they aren't actually there to criticize my frequent sobbing. Kudos!\n\nAs a side note (though this isn't a knock on Supernatural), my Oculus broke about a month ago and it took a month to get a new one in. I hadn't really considered that to be a scenario when I signed up for Supernatural but it's basically the equivalent of your car exploding and your gym is 20 miles away. I tried to replace it by swinging actual baseball bats in my living room. Mistakes were made.\n\nFinally, while I really do enjoy the playlists and song selection, it would be nice to have a metal workout thrown in their now and again. I imagine that the Venn diagram intersection of \"People who use Supernatural\" and \"Metalheads\" is rather small, but a guy can dream.\n\nIn conclusion, Supernatural is the best workout you're going to find on the Oculus, you will be challenged, it smells better than a gym, and don't swing actual baseball bats in your living room or your wife will get mad.

You move from song to song and location to location while the trainer occasionally spouts words of encouragement or reminders to watch your form and breathing. I thought the trainer's would annoy me, but I have found that I actually do value their occasional canned input. Each workout (playlist) is hosted by one of the staff trainers. Each trainer has a different style and different taste in music. I found myself favoring Leanne's workouts because I like the music she selects.\n\nI have been playing a little over a week, after being pretty sedentary during the pandemic. I did two sessions on the first day I had it and was quite sore the next day. I have been doing one or two a day since and am enjoying the feeling of progress as I feel less gassed and less sore afterwards.\n\nSome gripes\n-Not a huge backlog of workouts yet.\n-(more on the quest then the game) sweat is an issue, you either soak the quest foam or use a silicone cover which traps the sweat in the headset creating a thick fog that you can't see through\n-If you wind up for certain swings (like the rotations) the quest loses tracking for your controllers when you move them to far back or to the side.\n-Overall, the intensity of the workout is limited. I am just now getting to the point where I need to do two back to back to feel like I got a good workout. As my fitness level improves this game cannot remain the central pillar of my fitness plan.

Bugged tutorial, during the first test the banner didn't disappear hiding targets and making me confused until I figured out it is a bug.\n2. Hit-scan is broken, I can play Beat Saber at Expert with no issue but here somehow I miss many targets (better filtering/approximation algorithms are needed)\n3. No indicators like power, overall score, how much time is left, or how many songs are left\n4. Pixels in targets are noticeable, Beat Saber somehow achieved much better graphics on the same hardware.\n5.

There is no way to disable the trainer standing in front of you, I would rather enjoy the scenery than look at the guy.\n7. Lengthy loading time with a boring black screen. Why not show the scenery? Why they don't preload all resources from the Internet during the previous section or even when the headset is in standby.\n8. When you hit the target the feedback is very weak.\n9. There is no way to skip intro (or I missed it due to lack of indicator). There is a lengthy, boring introduction.\n10. I find the trainers often annoying.

Thank you.", "KaiFire7Jul 6 at 7:44 PM\nLove this App\n\nFirst I want to be clear that this rating is for the app alone. I'll talk about the service at the end.\n\nI need to say that I'm not a super fitness junkie, but I've been doing VR exercise quite regularly. I before this I'd typically do Beat Saber and BoxVR. I can honestly say the workouts in this are WAY better than the other 2. While the other's are good, Supernatural has a better combination of arm movements with lunges and squats that really makes it a workout. Always after a session, I can feel it in my arms, legs, chest, shoulders, my whole body.\n\nThen there are the trainers. That is another huge point of differentiation. In the beginning, I wasn't a fan of all of the coaches (Meg was not good), but the ones that are still making workouts today are excellent. My favorites are Leanne and Raneir (Coach Doc is hit or miss). They are engaging and encouraging in their workouts. It really helps move you along and make sure you are doing it correctly.\n\nAll in all, I love this app and it is a great part of my exercise routine.\n\nNow on to the service. There's no way around it. It is just pricey. When I can get a gym membership for $10/month ($120/year), $200/year (or $180 on sale) is just too much. I'm lucky because I received the year membership as a gift, but IDK that I can justify my 2nd year when that starts. I think making this comparable to the cost of a gym membership might be more palatable.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 7 at 11:06 AM\n\nVery cool to hear how much you've been enjoying your Supernatural workouts, glad you're really feeling the progress in your entire body.

Thanks again.", "jhelfApr 23 at 6:10 PM\nLove it!\n\nDid my first workout today and I loved it. Ive been waiting for a good VR workout app and this is exactly what Id expect from it. Great visuals and songs and I like having a coach there doing warm ups and stretches.\n\nAs far as price goes, Equinox charges $200 a month for crammed group sessions you have to book days in advance. If you are looking to do some cardio the $20 are well worth it in my opinion.\n\nHelpful | 30", "Awestin74Apr 24 at 5:20 AM\nMy body was not ready\n\nIve been using Beat Saber as a workout for almost a year now and even lost 20lbs combined with diet and strength training but now after doing workouts with Supernatural for the past two days I realize I wasnt pushing myself hard at all.\n\nSupernatural is a better more complete experience than your average game. Its more like a tool and with that I see the subscription model as fair. If youre serious about fitness especially using VR as a motivational tool you owe it to yourself to jump into the 30 day trial.\n\nThe app and heart rate integration is easy and rewarding. The coaches really push me to focus on form and push myself harder. The movement is geared to a full body workout that has me totally sore on my second day after a 20 min workout. Something an hour in Beatsaber never did.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful with 3D vistas in some gorgeous real world locations.\n\nI think this is something VR really needed and in my opinion worth the asking price.\n\nHelpful | 30", "jforniesApr 23 at 8:22 PM\nNot another music-cutting-blocks game\n\nWell, I normally read all the reviews before I purchase or install an app. I have to say that what other people find annoying, like the trainers talking all the time, for me, it helps me to get properly immersed into a real workout with a professional in the gym. I do appreciate the motivational words, and it doesn't bother me at all. I didn't expect this app to be just another music-cutting-blocks type of app, and I don't think that it should be compared with those, it's an application to work out and designed for that purpose with the help of professional trainers and I welcome that. The price is a different story, we may agree or disagree with the cost of it but I feel that the execution of the application is great, I personally think it's expensive for the current amount of content, but maybe is ok if the application develops further, I don't know. This is my recommendation to the developer, to really keeping on creating workouts so that differentiate even more from other games out there that are doing great at cutting blocks while listening to music. Good job.\n\nHelpful | 36", "gregostroffApr 24 at 3:59 PM\nSuper fun and measurable fitness benefit\n\nSupernatural is one of the few Quest apps I keep returning to again and again. It's a super fun, quick, high intensity cardio/strength workout that allows me to keep my daily training going no matter where I am or how much or little time I have available. Sometimes it's a top up to my training in between real life sports activities and other times it's the core workout of the day if that's all the time I've got. When I first started back in the fall I had been sidelined for training and aerobically detrained so I found Supernatural a great way to begin a gentle rehab....but it was hardly a gentle workout. If you're willing to go hard it will deliver or if you need a rest it will keep you in the game! Either way, I was back to my aerobic fitness levels in just a few weeks which was as fast or faster than my experiences in real life. Amazing! The musics great and makes it easy to flow along with 360 full body moves, while totally immersed in beautiful locations around the world. I appreciate the trainers curating the play lists to achieve the desired results and introducing the songs but my preference would be to have them key up the session goals and lead a cool down after but have the option to turn their coaching on/off during actual game play. Thank you Within for bringing out a VR specific training app with real world benefits!\n\nHelpful | 28", "Space_BeingMay 24 at 8:09 AM\nThe Half Life Alyx of workout apps!\n\nAfter experiencing Supernatural, I cant go back to working out in BoxVR or other apps. Ive been working out consistently in VR for about a year and a half now, and until recently its always felt like Ive been cobbling together apps to put together a work out. So and so for legs, so and so for cardio, so and so for core and upper body. Supernatural has found a way to put everything together into one fantastic workout. The trainers may not be live, but it often feels like it. And they push you. Im not sure if its an algorithm recognizing that Ive started to slack, but if I do theyre there pushing me harder. Its fantastic! Ive also recognized how much value working out to real songs brings. The subscription was a no brainer for me, especially since my wife has started working out in VR as well. After a year of trying to show her the merits of it, it was Supernatural that finally convinced her.\n\nIn the future I hope to see new and different activities added for a change of pace. Swinging bats is great and all, but it will be nice to have some variety of movement, and the ability to focus on specific muscle groups. Maybe something incorporating controllerless hand tracking? There is a lot of potential there for different workouts I think.\n\nHelpful | 7", "tmarconiMay 18 at 9:03 PM\nExcellent VR workout\n\nI had the same initial reaction as a majority of the folks leaving reviews here. Sticker shock, the price is too high, but I figured I would at least give it a try. After using it for the last two weeks, I had no problem paying for the annual fee, that is how much value I got out of this workout.\n\nA big part of this is because of the quarantine, I can't go to my gym, but that is only part of it, ultimately I can sneak in a workout that has me sweating with a solid heart rate in 20 minutes... the best part, is that it doesn't feel like a workout while I am doing it, only after when I am sore and honestly a little gross with sweat. One of the founders said something about Surfing and that you don't think of it as a workout when you are a riding a wave, you just feel it later when you realize you held that lunge for a few minutes many times a session. I absolutely see this in Supernatural. I get lost in the gorgeous scenery, the music, and the unrelenting activity that I don't think about the workout.\n\nI also have to admit that I am a fan of the instructors. I am not the guy that goes to gym classes. I don't do yoga or zumba or whatever group class is in now. Typically it is weights and some cardio, limit talking to anyone, get in, get out. I remember in high school having a strength coach really pump you up before a big lift or a run, the motivation and energy that you get from someone telling you that you got this is more beneficial than I remember and weirdly much easier to take virtually. I do agree with some reviews here that it would be great to see the instructors do some of these exercises, even if it is a mode to teach form since I am never sure I am doing it right. Overall, strongly recommend, enough that this is my first review and I maxed out the box writing it.\n\nHelpful | 9", "peanutbutterspiceMay 11 at 4:49 PM\nProbably the best VR workout app\n\nI would write a long-form review but Im using my phone.\n\nFor the Pros:\n1. The workouts are full 360 degree experiences. They encourage a full range of body movements and emphasize hitting targets harder rather than throwing a million targets at you at once (i.e., Beat Saber Expert or Expert+)\n2. Integration with heat rate tracking monitors and the like. Supernatural also displays the heart rate zones you were in while you worked out.\n3. Graphs of your heart rate, accuracy, and hitting power over time\n\nNeutral:\n1. The song selection is hit or miss.., but that is largely fine. Ive done a lot of cardio and training sessions to music I didnt particularly care for\n2. The difficulty scaling seems to be a bit wonky. I was a bit out of practice my first workout since I hadnt played Beat Saber and the like for a couple of months. Man, it was absolutely killer. At times it felt unrelenting. It didnt hinder me, I just kept going and focused on getting what I could, but I could see it becoming a big problem for newcomers.\n3. The price. This one is a bit up in the air at the moment since it hinges on what they bring to the table for each month. The number of workouts available right now is fine. Theyll need to provide more if they want to keep a subscription model though.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Stretching periods after workouts are laughably short. If you do a 25 minute workout a 30 second stretching session is absolutely inadequate. I would like to see an option to select a stretching period. I.E., selecting 5 or 10 minute stretching periods. Make them guided by instructors.\n2. No workouts currently exist that are longer than ~25 minutes.\n\nOver all it is probably the best VR workout app available IMO. Ill likely keep using it, even after the trial ends as long as they keep adding workouts and improve what is there\n\nI would also like a larger variety of music. Put in some metal tracks for those sessions focused on strength and power. Add ambiance based tracks (Think Tycho, etc.,) for more relaxing sessions. Electronic music (Com Truise, FM-84, Timecop, etc.,) would also be a great candidate for workouts. That is just my two cents.\n\nHelpful | 4", "yuripower8500Apr 23 at 10:18 PM\nAwesome!\n\nThis made my wife request that we buy a second Quest headset.

After my first try at this, I could barely walk the next day. A number of reviewers have\ncommented on the high cost. From my perspective, its well worth it assuming the developers continue to produce content with new music. The yearly cost of this is equal to one month at the upscale gym in my neighborhood, and I would have to drive to that and park (and its closed for the foreseeable future anyway). Its also a little more than my Netflix subscription and so far, I use this more often. The one thing that prevents me from giving this 5 stars is that its still a little buggy. Sometimes it opens assuming my floor is about 5 ft below where my floor actually is and then I have to redraw my boundary to get things back to normal. Then I had an experience where it just wouldnt load content. Super frustrating. Once they get those bugs worked out and get more musical content, its definitely a 5 star experience and highly recommended.\n\nHelpful | 5", "elliotsmommaJul 27 at 8:06 PM\nWow!

Beat Saber devs completely phoned it in and dropped the ball on new content, and Supernatural filled that void perfectly (so far).\n\nThere really is nothing else like it, comparisons to Peleton don't do justice to Supernatural. Peleton is at its core an expensive stationary bike... this is a completely new category of fitness experience. Beat Saber comes close but there just isn't nearly enough to keep up with Beat Saber, and as I was getting into Expert+ it stopped rewarding the kind of full body movement that made it enjoyable to me in the first place.\n\nSupernatural Devs are doing an excellent job, and recently announced a yearly plan that will take some of the edge off cost.

I was trying to move more of my workout to VR so have been doing Box VR, Beat Saber and Pistol Whip all games that get my heart rate up. But honestly I have to say this game gets my heart rate going the most and next to Box VR is probably the best workout with the arm motions and lunges. I like the music and the scenery and even the trainers. I know a lot of people are complaining about the price and I totally get that. But for someone who was used to paying $12-15 a class for yoga $20 a month for unlimited classes really because you can do it whenever you want is a real steal! If you are a workout person used to paying for aerobics, yoga, or other cardio type classes this is a good deal. I plan on adding some wrist weights eventually and maybe even a weighted vest to add in some strength training - hey Supernatural maybe that is an idea to come up with some workout accessories if you already haven't.\n\nUPDATE - Just a a few ideas - could you expand the profile part in the app so people could maybe describe themselves more. The ability to add pictures to comments and in the profile might be great too as people can post their before and afters. Also I see people talking about a discord chat but is there a way to add a forum to the app so people can post questions and interact directly there? A \"Store\" like I said above more merch and accessories. Saw the add of Meditation this Sunday so excited to check that out - please add more of that ...different time frames and focuses...I think many people like myself will LOVE that option to meditate in beautiful places with ambient sounds...like near an ocean or a waterfall, temple chanting...honestly mental health is so important now it would be a great add and give the app a lot more value if you are looking to build into more of a wellness app.\n\nHelpful | 1", "j1m2t3Jul 3 at 7:20 AM\nAwesome & great motivation\n\nI can only speak for myself.

With that said, I came in hoping for a nice complement to my home workouts during quarantine. This is a fine solution. While I'm a fan of home workouts like \"Insanity\", being home all day makes me want an escape during my exercise. With an inability to run outside as usual, this is a great alternative. The scenes are beautiful, music and trainers are engaging, and a 15 min workout had me feeling good to start my day. I might do a couple throughout the day as a break.

Frankly, I feel embarrassed for myself and embarrassed for the coaches.\n\nSo, back in the day when gyms were open, I'd typically hunker down with a handful of machines and call it a boring day.\n\nSupernatural really does change the game for me. I'm only a week in, but I'm honestly looking forward to jumping in every day. This is hard, fun and motivating. Moreover, I'm blissfully sore and achieving as good a cardio workout as anything else I've ever done.\n\nI use an Apple Watch for heart rate monitoring and integration there is great too.

They would also scoff at an Equinox membership. Thats fine - this app isnt for them.\n\nIm a 28/f who does not identify as a gamer, only got into the Quest because I had to develop some stuff for it for work, and I spent $500+/month on a gym membership and weekly personal trainer before COVID-19. Services like Supernatural, Peloton and Mirror appeal to me because they are *much cheaper* than the alternative, what I would be spending if I chose to exercise at a gym/with a trainer. As long as I am disciplined, I get the same value from that workout for a fraction of the cost.\n\nI agree that Supernatural feels out of place in the rest of the Oculus store, but feel that its because the target demographic simply has not adopted the technology as a whole yet. Supernatural is appealing to a niche demographic, and maybe its too niche for it to succeed (I hope not) but after playing the game two days in a row, I feel very strongly that the workout is extremely different than beat saber, boxVR and synth riders, which I also play regularly.\n\nThis app is incredible, beautifully done, and dynamic in its fitness offering.

At that price, this is a 1 star at app. Make it a $30 game and it is a 4 or 5 star game.\nIn case you dont want to read my entire rant, here is my summary. I hope everyone trys this game, and like me, really enjoys it BUT realizes there is no way they would pay $20 a month for what is provided. (see my reasons below as just a few why it isnt worth that kind of money). I then hope you post a review and email support and tell them that it isnt worth it. Hopefully the company will catch on, that to make it worth $240 a year they need to listen to customers and make changes. Or they could just offer the game at a $30 flat fee. I would be happy with that. I might even be willing to pay for additional content in the future.\nI emailed support to ask how they thought this was worth $240 year. They said it replaces your gym membership with fun, fresh, and new workouts with great music (which they have t license) and live coaches.\n1. The low intensity workouts are a bit easy for me. Medium are way to hard. Not the intensity but the complicated strike switches like you would see in other games. Support told me that just keep playing and you will get used to it. What will happen is you will start to memorize the patterns so you can make the strikes. Here is my issue, if I am paying for fresh and new content I dont want to play the same levels over and over again so I can memorize the motions. Just make it more intense without crazy strike patterns. They also said, dont worry about the score and points.

We actually really enjoy feedback from the Supernatural community and encourage our members to reach out to us. A lot of the features and enhancements that we've implemented since launch have been due to suggestions and requests from the Supernatural community. Our members have been very helpful in helping us shape Supernatural to be the premiere VR fitness experience. Thanks for the note about the cost, we strive to give our members convenient membership options including a discount annual rate and hope to have more options down the road. While we understand the subscription model is surprising, we do have a large team of developers, producers and content creators who work hard to put out a fresh, new workout every day. Thanks again for the review and we're happy to connect with you further if you'd like.

I want to be better, but I need to be eased into things and this just throws it all at you at once. Its almost so much that you get disheartened. I can never really tell if I am hitting targets even though I appear to be on the beat. It says it adjusts to your level but ya, no? How many times do I have to miss targets and stand through 30 lunges in a row before that kicks in? I love the concept. Love the songs that I have played so far but want to focus on form and that is hard to do when everything comes at you at once and there is no way to say EASY!!!! I can do lunges and squats that fast in a row or I can hit targets that fast. Both at the same time is just a recipe for failure.

The only time I sweat this much at the gym is full court basketball. The views are great, the motions all make sense from an exercise standpoint, and it really pushes you. Im sure more content will come in time so I have no gripe there - its early. The main issues Ive personally had are with the hit tracking being unresponsive at times and the pacing. It feels like at times its unrealistic to be able to make all the hits no matter how fit and quick you are. Definitely recommend this app, especially during this quarantine. I do agree with others that the price is a bit steep for what it is right now. As the title says, good, not quite great yet.\n\nHelpful | 3", "carmela.decastro.35Jul 25 at 3:32 PM\ngood exercise!!\n\ni dont\nknow why people would gjve this app less than 5 star - its. a great exercise app\n\nHelpful | 2", "HowBizarreApr 23 at 5:14 PM\nA Fantastic Foundation For A Fitness App\n\nThis is a day one review and I am sure Supernatural will continue to improve over time. I want to thank the developers for working on this program. I really enjoy the foundation of the experience.\n\nLet's start with the major gripe. The subscription seems to be a major issue for people... and it is up to you to see the value. I see value in the subscription so far because I like the coaching and it feels like it was designed to be a fitness app from the ground up. It offers relevant tips and I find the coaching encouraging.\n\nNone of the other VR programs really feel like a fitness program. They always feel like rhythm games that you can use to get some good cardio ETC. This feel much more like a fitness program where I am being coached through the process. I feel better about pushing myself because I can follow their tips and worry less about injuring myself because of bad form. One example was the trainer said \"Don't forget to relax the tension in your jaw.\" She was right I was tense and it did help... its a small touch but it goes a LONG way to make me feel like I am really working out versus playing a game.\n\nI took one star off because there is some room for improvement. I would like to see different color options for the targets. Black and White is good and looks clean, but when your looking at the sky or into the sun in the environment it blends into much and you can't read the targets.\n\nThe timing of swinging could be tweaked just a little. The timing of when you hit the targets feels a bit off. It seems weird and slightly off. it registers better when you hit the target with the handle of the bat and less with the tip... It feels like I am punching not swinging a bat. If you swing through like your playing tennis it helps.\n\nSmall gripe but I wish the bats had some feeling of interaction when they tapped against each other. It would help immersion if they did.\n\nI look forward to seeing how the developers and the trainers improve over time.\n\nHelpful | 7", "WeatherWimpApr 23 at 6:32 PM\nVery promising, and very different\n\nI have many of the apps some compare this to, and Supernatural is very different. I also think it has a lot of potential.\n\n+ Apple watch (and iphone and Android phones too I think) integration is great. While it may seem silly, tracking my workouts in a dedicated zones app (along with the supernatural app) is motivating.\n\n+ I believe the difficulty of the blocks/triangles having you swing, lunge or squat alter with your performance while you are actually doing the workout. Im pretty sure I read this, and even noticed it when I was tired and the triangles didnt seem to have me lunging quite as deeply.\n\n+ The bigger, sweeping movements seem better thought out than other games\n\n+ The instructors are a big plust for me, and I dont know why. Ive never been able to get into fitness videos or apps that are instructor led before, but for some reason the encouraging to be on my heels during a squat, you can do this type attitude helps a lot in this game.\n\n- The one knitpick I have is Im not sure how all the scoring for rewards works. Yes, it counts up how hard you hit stuff, how many you hit or squat/lunge in triangles, but it looks like there are brone / gold / etcl awards too. Do I need to move up if Im getting gold medals? Do a different workout if Im only getting bronze? Are these just given out based on your supernatural score?\n\nObviously the other negative would be the fitness app level pricing for a subscripiton, but that is just what it is, and not uncommon it seems in the fitness industry. the key will be what they provide for that subscription.\n\nIf the content / workouts updated daily make this keep feeling fresh and keeps more motivated to use the app most days of the month theyll get mey money...easily. If not, Ill go back to some non-subscription games.\n\nHelpful | 7", "AstralhipApr 30 at 10:11 AM\nExcellent Workout, Beatsaber Fanatic\n\nI am an expert+ Beatsaber player, so coming to this I had high expectations. The mapping isn't quite as well done, the tracking is a little off, but the experience is one of the best workouts I've had in VR. I do have a couple of suggestions: let us choose whether we want the warmup and cooldown, as it breaks my flow. Let us turn off the trainers completely if we want, I've never been one for workout guru platitudes. Let us string the workouts together into longer sessions, maybe a survival mode or something that just continues until failure. To the people complaining about the subscription, consider this: would you still be playing Beatsaber if you couldn't mod it and use legally questionable material? Other apps don't have this ability; Beatsaber was lucky enough to exist before VR went mainstream, and as of yet artists aren't enforcing copyright. For an app to remain fresh without this black market they MUST charge a subscription, it's the only way to stay afloat. This app is pioneering a new model, we'll see if it works.\n\nHelpful | 5", "jeff.stockton.161Jul 7 at 9:43 AM\nPerfect for traveling\n\nThis game is exactly what I needed.

We're putting a lot into offering a new workout on a daily basis to help make that happen. Thanks again for all the detailed feedback.", "elfhugMay 30 at 12:46 AM\nGood, but price not justifiable\n\nI've enjoyed the workouts but the subscription model adopted only really caters for someone who is prepared to fully commit on a daily basis And even then, in order to justify the price tag, it would need to be significantly better than anything else out in the market. And well....it just isn't. The developer should therefore consider an additional option for the casual, more occasional user.\nA purchase price of $30 with perhaps 10 workouts and the option to purchase additional workout packs would significantly extend the user base and bring the product within the realms of mass acceptability. I'm convinced that ultimately this dual pricing approach wil generate more revenue than alienating all those who are not able/prepared to pay either $149 up front annually or $,20 monthly , though who would probably wish to continue with Supernatural. And to be pragmatic, over time , we really don't need a NEW workout every day. I'm pretty sure that if the developer were to check the corporate play metrics it would reveal that even at this formative stage, most folks tend to gravitate towards their favourite workouts anyway!\nSo an alternative pricing option please for those who would like to use a few times a week as a component of a fitness regime and not it's main focus.\nThanks for listening\n\nHelpful | 3", "cprachApr 24 at 12:52 PM\nLets see where it goes\n\nKind of hard to judge an app like this on the first day using it. The whole idea is to have something new everyday so itll take a while to see if the workouts diversify enough to make it worth the cost. But here are my thoughts for now.\n\nI like that the app experience actually feels like a workout and not just playing a game that happens to make me sweat. The constant coaching and lack of game dynamics (like showing points as you go) set this apart from something like beat saber. I saw some folks dont like the coaching, but thats what makes it feel like being in a fitness class at the gym.\n\nThe settings are really beautiful and I like the fairly minimalist nature of the rest of the graphics. They cycle through a LOT of environments so hopefully theyre building a big library of these, and they wont all just be repeating after a week or two.\n\nAs for the workouts, I did feel that this was more work that most apps like Beat Saber or Pistol Whip. Mostly because it really engages your legs with as many squats and lunges in one song as youd do in an hour in one of those other games.\n\nLike I said though, the real question will be how much they add. I would want to see new styles of working out, new types of movement, and even some that focus more on stretching or breathing (which there is some of at the end). If the only things that changes are the songs and backgrounds, to me it wont be worth it. But well see.\n\nFinally, re: bugs, I did have a little freezing. Also, when you click start workout, theres no visual cue (pin wheel, fading, etc) to show its working on it. So you kind of just have to have faith and wait. I havent been able to pair either my facebook account or Fitbit to the app, but maybe thatll improve. Pretty much all new apps have some bugs.\n\nFor now, its 30 days free while Im otherwise largely stuck at home. For free, Ill happily give it five stars and stay optimistic and see what happens. Lets try some positivity, folks!\n\nHelpful | 19", "hellabella666Jul 25 at 2:12 PM\nAwesome Workout\n\nWorth the monthly subscription.

This fitness app is now my #1 for actual fitness, followed by Box VR and Thrill of the Fight.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful 360-degree landscapes are much better than dark computer-generated caves. It was amazing how much more refreshing it was to exercise in that environment.\n-Tracking was accurate and precise. In-app graphics are sharp.\n-The motion encourages full motion at the shoulder with the tails on the balls that you are hitting, whereas with Beatsaber you can often just get by with a little flick of the wrist and the elbow once you get used to it. This led to a much more robust upper-body workout and my shoulders feel well-worked.\n-Coaches are helpful during the workout, e.g. they give you a heads up that some cross-arm movements are coming. I also appreciated their encouragement during the workout, I didn't find it distracting.\n-The triangle squat/lunge boxes led me to find myself in a low lunge jumping right to left to the beat of the music in a way no other app has gotten me to do.\n-The short warm-up/cool-down are appreciated, they'll decrease my risk of injury.\n- 20-30 min duration is perfect\n-Music was catchy and easy to get into the rhythm of during exercise.\n-They are sending me a free oculus quest sweat liner as a core member, how cool is that!? This is probably a limited time offer though.\n\nCons:\n-Obviously the subscription cost is too high for most people. I would be highly likely to maintain my subscription for $5/month after paying $30 or so for the app, but $20 is too much. Perhaps the subscription could unlock added features like the daily workouts, more personalized coaching, and customization options, whereas the plain app would come with a core group of workouts only.\n-Music and trainers are not kid-friendly with their language. My young son wanted to play, but unless the songs are radio-edits and the trainers avoid cursing I won't be letting him.\n\nHelpful | 18", "kane132Apr 26 at 2:40 PM\nNeeds work\n\nUpdate:\nThings seem to have stabilized and I can now make it through a workout on my first try.\n\nMy biggest issue is the \"dynamic difficulty\". I'm not sure how it works, but the effective difficulty is too high for a fitness app in my opinion. It feels like playing beat saber one level higher than I'm comfortable, and hitting orbs seems to be less forgiving with accuracy than a game like beat saber. This isn't what I want from a fitness app. I want to be able to focus on form and power, but instead I'm flailing desperately trying to keep up with the insane barrage of orbs. I regularly have to completely stop myself and reset in the middle of a song to try and get back in sync, it completely kills my workout. BoxVR does this very well by comparison, it's very physically challenging but rarely complex enough that I miss more than the occasional target.\n\nIn contrast with other reviews, I like the trainers (as a fitness experience it makes sense). However the music seemed too quiet when the trainer wasn't speaking. Music and scenery were great in general.\n\nGiven the high recurring costs and issues mentioned above, I'll most likely stick with BoxVR for my VR workout until they refine this experience more. I hope they do!\n\nOriginal:\nSeems like they're having some major launch issues. I wasn't able to make it through the tutorial even after multiple hard resets. The trainers stutter and the experience freezes constantly. At one point I lost tracking one a controller completely. Another time the game started repeatedly launching a training video over and over in quick succession. Don't waste your time until they manage to stabilize their software. At least there wasn't an upfront cost...\n\nHelpful | 14", "littlenezzieMay 27 at 10:50 AM\nI agree with many reviews I read\n\nI dont mean to be redundant but Im enjoying the trial with indecision to continue.

Every 3-4 minutes (depending on song length) the screen blacks out, the new location loads, and the trainer gives some cheesy DJ intro about how awesome they think this next song is. The end result is a good 30 seconds of down time every 3-4 minutes which leads to this being more like a game than a workout. I also think the tracking is less accurate than box vr. The problem might be the targets. BoxVR has glowing bright targets against a dark background. This app has white and black targets against varied backgrounds sometime white (like ice) sometime dark grey (like a stormy sky) so it is harder to pick them up. They also spawn a lot closer than box vr, so I feel like I am just swatting them away vs seeing an incoming combo and mentally preparing to focus on my moves. End result is a frustrating experience and not as good a workout as I feel I could have.

During my 30-day trail period, I definitely felt the intensity of the workout, and I did see some results physically, but it still felt like a workout to me.\n\nOther games like Thrill Of The Fight and Beat Saber nail the fun, and a decent workout is an added benefit. Those apps also have a one-time purchase payment method.\n\nThe argument that \"there are only so many ways to provide a rhythm experience\" feels cheap, and for $19 a month I expect something that other apps don't provide. I agree that it's difficult to innovate, but this app is sort of a Beat Saber clone, and doesn't really do anything extraordinary with the mechanics.\n\nI do appreciate the focus on fitness, especially the different trainers, but as a result the app feels even more like a workout and doesn't provide enough fun.\n\nTL;DR: The price justifies the team backing it, but the product doesn't fulfill its promise of a fun workout.\n\nHelpful | 3", "MopsinatorMay 2 at 7:03 AM\nIncredible\n\nBlows beat saber out of the water if you are looking for a 20-30 minute exercise.

I'm a reasonable Beat Saber player, and am approaching Supernatural for the exercise benefits. I am also over 50 and not in great shape.\n\nSo, you get curated workouts from a too small pool of mostly modern pop / R&B which relied mostly on a feature called \"Dynamic Difficulty\". This...doesn't work. Technically, the difficulty switches patterns fairly frequently based on how you are doing. But as an exercise medium it makes you switch up your timing, tricky to learn the flow of a song and keeps you off balance.\n\nFix: New workouts seem to have almost completely dropped the dynamic difficulty and specifiy a low, medium, or high intensity fixed workout. These are MUCH betterm and provide a better flow.\n\nFix 2: New songs are coming from 60s - 80s, with quite a bit more rock in the mix. I suspect their user base is skewing a bit older. And the all-disco/funk workout is dead perfect for this game. And awesome.\n\nGood: I am covered in sweat after a low or medium intensity. Their curated workouts have a much better flow than trying to do something in Beat Saber, and the game encourages wider/stronger moves with less rapid repetitive motions.\n\nGood: The personal trainer in your ear-thing, coaching you as you go through a song. There is constant encouragement to hit harder, move more, and occasionally advise you how to deal with tricky sections. This felt out of place with Dynamic Difficulty, but now the coach is tied to the exact patterns and flow. And it works. When the evil person on my shoulder says \"hit harder\" I do. It sounds hokey, but the encouragement works for me.\n\nMeh: Price. Daily new workouts with new songs. Now that I'm seeing how the changes are kicking in, I committed to a 1 year sub. It does seem worth it...now.\n\nBad: Hit detection. There is still something off with hit detection. I think the targets need to be a bit more forward of your view so the camera sees them.\n\nHelpful | 5", "SophiaMoriaMay 17 at 1:38 PM\nWorth it!\n\nThis game is so fun and totally worth your money.

Its so fun, its an awesome workout, and when you get into the zone it just starts to feel really exciting.\n\nI love this app, worth the monthly fee as long as they keep it fresh and have new tracks\n\nHelpful | 5", "mbrucknerMay 20 at 5:54 AM\nAmazing Experience!\n\nSupernatural is hands down my absolute favorite game for the Quest, and it is only getting better. While yes, there is a subscription cost associated with the service, I can confidently say that it is worth every penny. It has helped me to be far more active than I have been in a long time, and I find myself thinking about my next workout all day at work!\n\nThe workouts are engaging, the visuals are stunning, and the virtual coaches go a long way to making the experience even better. New workouts are released every day with all different genres of music, so you don't have to do the same workout every time (although I definitely have some favorites). The experience has also continued to evolve and improve lately as well. The initial primary set of workouts used a \"dynamic difficulty\" which would ramp the intensity of the workout up or down depending on how accurate you are. Recently though, the team has introduced a new style of workout which allows you to choose a specific intensity, where the only thing that changes during the workout is the speed at which the targets fly at you.\n\nThe companion app works flawlessly, connecting both to my Quest and Apple Watch. Between each song, you'll see a quick graph that shows your score, accuracy, and heart rate for that song. When you've finished, you'll see a detailed breakdown of your entire session, which also then syncs to the app.\n\nMore than anything, I am impressed by how much the Supernatrual folks are taking feedback to heart. Whether its in introducing the new workout styles, changing up the music and introducing new songs and genres, or addressing bugs and questions, it is clear that they are listening to what the community has to say.\n\nFor anyone who is thinking about signing up, the free trial is a no-brainer. Give it a try and see how well it works for you, with your setup and your workout style. You won't be disappointed!\n\nHelpful | 5", "benfredwrightMay 15 at 6:15 PM\nWorth it\n\nIve been using Supernatural every day for a month now. $20 a month is a lot for a game, yeah, but I do think this is more than a game. They have a whole team of people making daily workouts. It definitely feels more like peloton where they are actively involved.\n\nThe beatsaber - like mapping is amazing, much better than stock beatsaber levels - more up to the standards of beatsaber custom tracks.\n\nI also have yet to get tired of the real world / science fiction locations. These feel open and magical, a much better workout environment than the typical claustrophobic VR neon fest.\n\nYou do sweat a LOT so a sweat resistant faceplate is basically required.\n\nIf you end up liking it the annual subscription makes this effectively $13 a month. Which is still a lot but Im definitely sold.\n\nHelpful | 6", "KennygexperienceMay 15 at 9:48 AM\nWorkout Motivation Restored\n\nFor the last 8 years my health and fitness have been very important to me. Ive primarily done most of my training at the gym, adopting both cardio and strength based training. In late March, my local gym closed due to COVID-19. For over a month, Id lost all motivation for working out.\n\nWhen Supernatural released in late April, I thought Id give it a shot... and Im hooked. While I will still primarily continue strength training with weights, Supernatural has been my go-to workout for cardio based training.\n\nWhy does it work so well?\n\nMOTIVATION - since Ive started using the Supernatural VR, Ive exceeded my 1000 calorie daily move goal (yes, it has full integration with Apple watches, fitbits, etc.) every day for the last two weeks. My daily motivation to jump in to Supernatural is the strongest differentiator compared to other fitness apps. Each morning Im greeted with a NEW workout - with fresh music and narration by a highly driven and charismatic team of trainers. Furthermore, there is a community post board, allowing me to follow and be followed by the rest of the Supernatural community.\n\nMany feel the subscription cost is too high. I would personally argue that the cost to support new daily content with top-notch production is much lower than I would be paying for a stripped down gym membership (of which I have no access to right now). These are the elements that will continue to motivate me day after day as opposed to the same monotonous content provided in other VR fitness offerings. Good on you, Within, for innovating to make fitness fun and motivational through VR!\n\nHelpful | 6", "luolin61May 15 at 12:36 PM\nIts Good, IMHO\n\nI like this app.\nI dont mind the trainers. I think they are doing a service that some of us like. I would like to option out the canned comments. I got music going, trying to cross over to the opposite side opposite cone, dont need any commentary. I am the person if I get lost while driving, I got to turn down the radio, if you know what I mean.\nI like the music. I am old, so most of this I have never heard of. But I like it. If you would ask me about genres Im ok with any, but a little Sir Elton John wouldnt hurt. Only thing that would really irk me is that since this is a really positive app, environments are great, always talking about balance, then dont add music that has any violence in it. I will quit it in a minute.\nI like that I can see that these workout increase the heart rate and what not. I dont see this with Beat Saber or Boxing VR. But getting the right playlist for BVR is key to that I think.\nI think other reviewers have said this but it would be nice to be able to have a playlist.\nSaw the Dynamic indication on todays workout. I guess I havent noticed this before. Probably need some explanation for that but I can figure out the context here.\nAgain, I know why the Devs have said about the costs. Would like to see some effort to bring down the cost. If not, its a bit beyond my budget for me. I dont even spend $19 a month for Quest games. We all have to pay some kind of wifi bill also. So when the devs say they have their costs, we do to.\nIf anyone gets down to this point of my review, this would be a five star review if its not for the cost.\nI would like everyone to be kind to the trainers.\nI will update closer to the end of my trial period. Lets at that time see what the devs done.\nAdditional, one week later...\nI like this still. Devs seem to be listening to feedback. Still has some issues between songs and lag time. Yesterdays workout had some tech issues with no cones, just balls. Todays workout was a beginner workout and it was almost too slow for me and I didnt think that was possible. Anyways, I still have almost 3 weeks left and I think that this will be my go to app for exercise. I will be staying with the app for a while. Truthfully, when I go back to work after this pandemic, I will have to see if I can muster the energy up for either a early morning or later in the evening workout. This app takes a lot of energy. All other apps I can do.\nUpdate: I do these workouts everyday. I look forward to my daily swatting and squatting. I especially look forward to Leanne and Raneir as they are great motivators. SN now has a yearly membership that I think is very reasonable. I signed up so I am looking forward to seeing these great places around the globe while doing these workouts. This is what I need.\n\nHelpful | 6", "andrew.wagnerApr 25 at 2:56 PM\n\nIm going to just ignore the pricing and have this review be based solely on the experience. (We all know its overpriced, etc... not reiterating what all the other reviews have said)\n\nDesign:\nThat being said, this is such a great start to a really exciting new side of VR. The amount of thought that went into the UI/UX and overall graphics is something I want to applaud them for. Quest titles too often are clunky looking or pixelated or the 3D effects are off. Not so with Supernatural.\n\n75% of the stages have an amazing depth of field. (Some of you might know what Im talking about, games like Real VR Fishing where part of the environment is 3D and the background just appears flat/no true depth is achieved and the illusion of immersion is gone)\n\nSupernatural has really done a good job of combatting that by really making these environments realistic and immersive. Not all of the stages pop as much as others, but the England, Galapagos, Scotland, and several other stages are really standouts for me and several of the stages feel like youre lookin off into the distance (not sure how this is achieved, but please keep it up!)\n\nIm really hoping the developers keep creating stages, because that is easily one of the biggest standouts of this game and it will be important for people who are continuing to pay a monthly subscription.\n\nGameplay:\n\nOkay, so, not to be that guy but I like to think of myself as somewhat fit/active. Pre-COVID, I was lifting 4-5 times a week at the local Y, squatting several sets of 360+ etc... even during shelter in place Ive tried to stay active and do at home workouts, etc... I like to think I havent totally gotten out of shape since quarantine.\n\nSo when I downloaded the app on day 1, I came into it with somewhat of a how hard can this be attitude.\n\nGorl, what an arrogant mistake. My quads, glutes, and inner thighs were KILLING in the best way the next day. This workout had me breathless, sweating so much I had to have a towel in the room, and was such a fun workout/cardio experience that you look forward to it?? (Im of the opinion that cardio is of Satan, and team lifting all the way, but LAWD if this isnt fun and super sweaty way to stay fit!)\n\nI havent felt this sore since before quarantine and it made me SO happy to find a way to continue my fitness while staying at home, (because doing 200 push-ups or 400 air squats with a weighted backpack with my Luke Skywalker Dagobah lookin a$$ just gets old real fast)\n\n\nSo yes, those are the things that I absolutely love about this app, however, I do think there are room for future updates. Here are a list of things that I think the Supernatural community can really benefit from in future updates:\n\n1.) Orb haptic feedback for trails. When there are orbs with trails that you have to slice and then trace, I wish there was a form of haptic feedback that could let you know how youre doing, similar to Synth Riders.\n\n2.) Future stages. I really hope theres a steady slew of updated new locations with as much attention to the environments as some of the good ones I mentioned above.\n\n3.) More control. I think having options where you can choose stages is a must have. Also being able to pick songs, because some pop songs get real old real fast.\n\n4.) Meditation/Breathing/non-physical exercise. I fully believe mental health is just as, if not more important than physical health. One of the biggest reasons I workout is for that mental health boost. I think taking advantage of these awesome environments, and being able to have a warm down mode where you can sit down or just do non-physical breathing/meditation activities could be amazing. (Especially something to take advantage of during this pandemic). Im already torn by wanting to admire the scenery while working out, so this can provide a way to fully relax and work on your breath and stress. So maybe having a mental health coach is something to look into (think Ten Percent Happier)\n\nAnyways I just spent like half my Saturday afternoon writing this novel, so hope some of this is helpful for potential buyers and the developers.\n\nHelpful | 15", "GilbertOrangeJun 1 at 1:25 PM\nCant find exit\n\nSuper workout without feeling like a workout.

As a fitness enthusiast, this app made my body feel exhausted after one playlist. Ive been reading other reviews and all I see is its too expensive. Well, all I have to say is, if you have enough money to buy a $399+ console, then paying only $20/month is nothing. The amount of detail and use of trainers to guide you is well worth the money.\n\nTo me, this app isnt a game. To me its an at-home gym with your own trainer. I loved how diverse the movements were to each song and how it made your body feel afterwards. You really feel every muscle in your body working out. If you do cardio before a workout, skip it and use this app! After I did a playlist, I went into my daily exercise with the equipment I have at home and felt AMAZING! If you cant go to a gym, then paying for this app each month is just as good.\n\nI know it is new so it does need some tuning up with accuracy. Some times I would be hitting the orbs but it wouldnt count it.

I know it's like other games but I like that it's more focused on movement than just smacking things. You sort of discover that there is an intentional groove to the movements. I like that it syncs with my phone and the heart rate monitor on my Apple Watch. I have the goal of using it everyday for the 30 day trial and will judge it more at that time if I feel the membership fee is worth it. If I'm still having fun and I'm feeling better and have more energy through the day I'll continue to use it.\n\nOne note for the developers: When I finished my workout today my wife asked if that was it? She was watching it streamed to my iPad. She was surprised that the virtual coach didn't go through more of an end of workout cool down exercise of some sort. To help you ease out of it. After thinking about it that seems like an important detail that's been missed - especially for people like me that don't typically exercise. Maybe suggest stretches or breathing exercises to cool down? In my case my wife is athletic and she walked me through a few good stretches and breathing techniques that I wouldn't have known about otherwise.

I've noticed that it's mostly peripheral ones. Also some of the orbs are unrealistic.

Either she's not doing it with us, or the a audio is off track.\nThere's no way to turn the coach audio off...\nThe price had been talked about already. Maybe $20-30 to buy and pay for each additional exercise is a better way? As it is, it's more expensive than a gym membership.\nNew exercises every day... Doesn't seem like a good idea. Once a week seems like a better plan otherwise there no reason to have leaderboards. It takes a few run throughs to get a good swing on the rhythms especially if you don't know the music (like me) and not everyone can do 20 min exercises several times a day.\nPairing to my phone. I don't understand why i had to do this. My fitness tracker is a whoop, and not on the list. Seems like the companion app should be optional.\n\nGood:\nCoaches are enthusiastic.\nScenery is beautiful.\nExercises are on point and flow well.\n\nI could see myself using this daily but not with new exercises daily.

I have pretty vanilla musical taste (Hip-Hop, Pop, Dance and K-Pop). The song choices are a good mix of the first two. But the body movements are great and motivation comes from the coach, not from obsessing over score, which brings a lot of value over other rhythm games.\n\nThe sceneries are also nice but as usual, any sort of VR experience that uses recordings or photos looks a little strange. Its also kind of a strange choice to do a workout on top of an active volcano.

It keeps me going and focusing on what I should be doing.\n\nI have three suggestions:\n1. Have a length option for each day:\n- While I like that there is a new workout everyday and appreciate how difficult it is to create, it would be nice having a choice for a 20, 30, or 40 minute workout each day. I know I can always do a second workout, but then Im going through a cool down then another warmup when Id like to keep my heart rate up.\n\n2. More movement:\n- I love the squats and the movement. While I know the bread and butter is hitting the balloons, I think the movement is amazing and would love to have more, even if that means sacrificing a some balloons.

It costs too much. And yeah, youd think that..until you actually try it. And by try it, I dont mean an hour or so...Im talking about committing to at least a week of training. As a professional fitness instructor, I can say, without a doubt, this program works.\n\nFirst of all, the instructors, while on the surface seem a bit gimmicky, actually begin to grow on you. Theyre purpose is to motivate and inspire you throughout the course of your training, and for the most part...it works. As you get to know each personality, you begin to look forward to what theyll present next, which can be quite fun. (also, keep in mind that no two workouts are the same. You get a new workout for each day of the week, which I absolutely love). Secondly, the music...its awesome. These arent generic tracks, like the ones you hear in most other rhythm games...no, these are the real deal. Lizzo, One Republic, The Weekend...some of the greatest artists and their songs will, not only motivate you to come back for more, but push you through to the end when you feel like youve had enough.\n\nMy last training session consisted of two workouts, lasting roughly 33 minutes. During that time, I burned 360 calories, with an average heart rate of 145. I hit max heart-rate (184 BPM) on several occasions and almost gave up as I drew closer to the end of the routine (keep in mind, I wear 1lb gloves and an 8lb weighted vest while training). Two things got me through it...my propensity to always finish what I start...and Lady Gaga! Lol, seriously, if thats not worth 20 bucks, I dont know what else is.\n\n(I charge 50 bucks an hour and would consider it great day to see one of my clients burn 360 calories in a half hour!)\n\nGive it shot. Commit to a solid month of training...as you improve, add some weighted gear. By the end of the month, if you dont look and feel better than when you started, cancel the free 30 day trial.

The entire experience is extremely polished and has already shown results. On the surface, this will look similar to other rhythm games out there (Im a huge Beat Saber player btw) but in actual gameplay, Supernatural is quite different than anything Ive yet played in how it makes you workout.\n\nThe proof of its fitness effectiveness is just trying it for a couple of weeks and feeling the results. I absolutely recommend trying the 30-day free trial. If youre like me, then youll look back on your first two weeks and find that you looked forward to working out more than you ever have before, burned more calories than in any other VR game and - this is an important one - are feeling better than you have in a long time (the movements in the game just feel really good to do).\n\nIf youre expecting this to be a rhythm game, its not and you will most likely be disappointed (its more along the lines of a Peleton fitness program than Beat Saber). For example, you cant just select a particular song to play, you can play either a brand new daily workout designed for that day or past ones in different categories. Competition is based around pushing you and your friends in workouts rather than getting a high score based on gameplay mechanics. For example, scoring is based more on how you worked out to that song (power used to hit notes, squats, etc.), not just on how many notes you hit or the precision of your swing arc, etc..\n\nIs Supernatural for everyone? It depends - it's a fitness program. You have to want to intensely workout and get very sweaty every time you play. Secondly, after the free month trial, the $19 a month may be out of some peoples budget.

And even if all of those things were perfect, IT'S A SUBSCRIPTION. An expensive one at that. What a joke. I'm a young guy with expendible income that loves to regularly play BeatSaber on expert and I've been eagerly waiting for this to be released based on the trailer. I was willing to pay a decent amount of money to buy it when it came out. Not only will I not be paying for their ludicrous subscription, I will be canceling my trial as it is not even worth my time.\n\nHelpful | 29\nDeveloper ResponseApr 23 at 6:37 PM\n\nThank you for trying Supernatural.

Every VR fitness game I've played continuously adds free content to the game and they all only do one time fees. $20 a month or even $10 a month is such an insane amount of money for a VR game its mind boggling how the devs thought this was a good idea. Gameplay is fine and it's a decent workout but the idea of having to spend $240 a year (and still not even own it than) just to play a game I've already bought is so ridiculous. Fix the broken price scheme and just make new content dlc because the current state of the game is a greedy joke and you should be ashamed. And before you compare this game to a gym membership, keep in mind gyms have tons of equipment, staff, and other amenities for you to enjoy. Gyms also have to worry about paying rent for their physical location and even with all of that cost you can get a Planet Fitness membership for $10 a month. The developers got greedy and now they're hiding behind an excuse that they have to do they monthly subscription to pay trainers and choreographers when no other VR fitness games have the same problem. If you think bestsaber and pistol whip dont have choreographers to help them make new songs than you dont know anything about game design and they both push out new content for free all the time.

The exercises are challenging and fun but actually adapt in near real-time to your specific level of effort. I couldnt keep up at first and the app made it a bit easier WHILE I was doing the exercise. The coaches are what I needed most. Its such a comfort to have them guide me through each session.

Please keep in mind the intention of this app is for workout purposes, which I feel it does very well. It makes you use your arms, core, legs, shoulders, and gets your heart rate pumping. Ive done 4 workouts thus far. The coaches keep you motivated, especially since youre most likely not going to get a perfect score. Again, the intention is to get a great workout, not climb the leaderboards. The music is great for working out. One thing I would like to see is the dynamic difficulty ramp up a bit slower. The game seems to have a lot of confidence in me haha. If youre looking for an alternative to the gym during the shelter were under, or if the gym isnt for you, I feel this is a great alternative to stay in shape. It is going to be added to my weekly routine. Ive seen them say the $19.99 a month will also be offered alternatively at a discounted price with a longer commitment, which I think is great. I would like to get an update on that as soon as they have more to share. I also really like the Apple Watch tracking so I can see my bpm and cals burned.

Really good music and great coaching.\n\nHelpful | 1", "TuRish93May 10 at 12:57 PM\nGreat concept, very steep price point\n\nStarted using the free trial right on the day this app was launched. You definitely get a lot of upper body (specifically arms, shoulders and upper back) exertion but not enough lower body to call it a full body workout. Some tracks do a good job at making you squat or lunge repetitively but most focus on the speed and agility of your upper body. The heart rate during the workout comes close to when I am doing my regular HIIT bodyweight workout. However, I feel it is too expensive at $19/month especially when my HIIT bodyweight training app charges me $75/year for a premium full body workout subscription.\nDont agree with some people mentioning the coach voices are disturbing. You can simply turn down their voice volume or honestly just let them be. It is very similar to if you were to train at a gym with a trainer or train at any sport. Ive not known one trainer that keeps quiet and doesnt push you constantly throughout your training.\nOverall, worth a 30 day free trial and 4 but needs some more thought.\n\nFor the devs:\nSome issues do need correction, for example, the controllers temporarily lose spatial calibration and appear floating at a random point. When it is a fast paced song, it is impossible to pause the workout and restart it to resolve the issue without missing a huge number of targets, not to mention that messes up the pace and the rhythm.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Jenn_w_2_nsJul 4 at 7:32 PM\nBest Fitness App for VR!\n\nI bought the Oculus Quest after I stumbled on this Fitness App. I get a hell of a workout, they have new music and workouts every week and the coaches are great!

When they released their FitBeat song, that was when I really got into it. But playing the same song over and over again gets old really fast.\n\nAnd thats where Supernatural really shines. You get a brand new workout every day, all intended to get you sweating. Not to mention multiple coaches, top 100 songs, amazing locations, and beautiful app design and functionality. The top notch production value proves theres a talented team behind this thing.\n\nYes, the mechanics are similar to Beat Saber or any other rhythm game for that matter. But this is clearly different. Its not a video game for kids, its a gamified workout for people serious about getting fit.\n\nAs for the price, yes $19/mo seems a little steep. Its high enough that it requires a little bit of commitment. But for the right person, I think it makes sense. As for me, Im going to give it a full 30 day trial and see how it goes.\n\nDont be fooled by the 1 star reviews from people who havent even tried it (its only been out for two days as of writing this).

Says good things about their team.**\n\nTo begin with, it's a bit of a pain to have to download the app and jump through the hoops there when it doesn't seem like a phone is necessary at all.\nAlso, I really do not like the fact that it's subscription model, but a free month is certainly nice.\nThat said, It's very nicely polished and plays great on the quest. I've only done the intro then straight to the hardest \"pro\" mix. Holy cow it's awesome.\n\nI play beat saber, Box VR, and thrill of the fight regularly for exercise. This is an excellent mashup of box vr and beat saber.\nBox VR is a great workout, but it's not designed to trip you up mentally like Beat saber is, it also doesn't havn't a lot of squats. Where as beat saber is just a fun game.\nSupernatural throws all the fun balls at you to hit in difficult angles, like beat saber, but at a pace much like box vr and it encourages strong purposeful hits like Box VR. The squatting and side lunging is very nicely done.\nThe environments are spectacular, though I don't care much for background aesthetics.\nAfter finishing the first song in the pro workout I was panting. They've done a great job. The fact that there's a coach there challenging you to keep up the pace is icing on the cake.\n\nAll that said, I can see getting bored with it if you're looking for a fun engaging game.

That is a separate component of a game review and it should be discussed but should not impact your scoring of a game's content. Do I think that this game is overpriced if you plan on using it for a year? Probably. Do I think most people are going to use this or any other game regularly for a year? No. The vast majority of users will likely play this game and have fun for a couple months and given the 1-month free trial and the monthly pricing, you will spend less on this game for more hours of fun than most other Oculus games.\n\nAs for the content of this game, I think it is fantastic. I have beatsaber, all the boxing games and some of the music rhythm games but this easily trumps them all in terms of a workout. The workout is more dynamic, the coaches are motivating without being intrusive and there is new content on the reg. It connects pretty well with my apple watch and it is a better workout than BoxVR. I think it likely tracks worse than beatsaber but I also think it requires more precise swings than other similar games. However, this game has you moving around the room and rotating far more than every other game so I give it some leeway. As well, it has actually recognizable songs which I find much more enjoyable than the random beats in the other games. I often singalong while working out.\n\nI do not think the game is flawless but it is innovative, fun and an entirely better workout experience than any other quest game by a significant margin.\n\nHelpful | 5", "mastermanagerMay 15 at 7:11 AM\nBest exercise experience ever!\n\nThis app is incredible!

So I do like this and as someone who misses the gym, I recognize that you guys did a great job with this. I definitely feel it during this stay at home down time.\n\nBut here is my problem. This is not supposed to be a game like Best Saber. It's a work out app in VR. I consider myself good at Beat Saber but no where near great. So when the arrows come at you inches from one another in crazy directions, the app doesn't fail you for not hitting them, but I feel defeated. And this was the sunrise work out that wasn't supposed to be THAT bad. I get it. Maybe I just suck. But if there isn't an option for middle difficulty at least, then I'm never going to return to this work out and probably not return to the app.\n\nI feel I get a great workout with repetition, and that's a lot of what my old kickboxing classes were. But with the beat saber approach and the black and white arrows coming from different angles at once, I feel like I'm struggling more than getting a workout.\n\nI'd recommend a medium difficulty, where maybe every other beat is a hit but the cadence and motions remain the same. If that's even possible. Otherwise Beat Saber gets the job done just fine and I don't have to pay every month. But if you guys can make it accessible to various skill levels for what's expected in hitting the arrows, then I don't mind the price. Especially because it supplements the gym.\n\nHelpful | 4", "believenApr 24 at 8:58 PM\nSo much potentials\n\nTruly, I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but alas, here we are. After this long review, I will put my opinion on whether it is worth 19.99$/mo.\n\nIs it fun? Yes it is. It's like 360 degree beat saber plus some box vr with squats and lateral lunges.\n\nIs it a workout: yes. It definitely is a workout. It got me sweating after a few minutes.\n\nDoes the app itself work? I do think the tracking for my controllers isn't completely there, i.e: if I move my hands/controllers too far back. However, that's an Oculus issue I feel like, not the developer issue.\n\nSceneries: the sceneries are beautiful I must say.\n\nSpace: you do need bigger space than, for example, beat saber, because you will be moving 360 and be able to do later lunges in all those directions.\n\nWhat are these trainers? I echo everyone else's concern with these trainers being kinda annoying. I feel like there should be a built in feature to mute them if for example, I'm just not the type of person to want to listen to someone tell me to squat.\n\nNOW MOT: Is it worth $19.99/Mo? At this point? Definitely not. There's only 7 (or 8?) Workouts available. I sure hope more features will be added, like multiplayer, more songs, short and longer workouts and more functions... But until those features are added, I unfortunately don't think will be continuing after the trial.

I feel like there could be more forgiveness in the ball timing. I also wish there was a way to mute the trainers.\n\nAll in all, if your internet speed is good, it's a GREAT FUN workout.

I am very good at beat saber type games to this thinks I'm able to handle alot more than my body can take. Also the voice overs do not match each difficulty. They will talk about getting low yet.. no triangles. Also telling me your doing it with me is a flat out lie so just please take it out or actually do it while coaching.\n\nThe price is steep for what we get. The coaching is not tailored to each difficulty and can be way off on the guidance.

Apps like beat saber are designed to be games first with the side benefit of exercise. Supernatural is an exercise app with gaming elements. They put the exercise first which is why the exercise routines are far superior to any workout you will find from any other quest app.\n\nI dropped it a star because it needs to be more customizable. You cannot set difficulty on the workouts and I found myself almost stopping halfway through some of the songs. I know the difficulty is supposed to adapt to your skill, bit I have not really felt that while playing. Certain map designs just seem almost impossible for me and it can be discouraging. In the tutorial the trainer mentioned pro vs novice or something like that, bit I could not find anything like it.\n\nI love the trainers as it makes the workout feel like I am at a gym. For me this is extremely helpful. At the end of a routine, seeing my percentages is a nice gaming element that helps me compete against myself. I also love that there are new routines each day and that I will not be repeating the same songs over and over like I do in beat saber.\n\nTL/DR, if you want a workout, supernatural is great. If you want a game, play beat saber.\n\nHelpful | 3", "aalorniApr 26 at 1:58 PM\nMy first review...give it a chance!\n\nI dont write a lot of reviews, but this is worth it.

I want to like it, I really do, theres clearly a lot of effort put into making this a good experience, but in the end it falls short for a number of reasons\n\nPROS:\n- Overall great workouts. I genuinely believe Supernatural will get you sweating in a way no other VR game currently available will. Yes its a beat saber clone but the changes made are very beneficial to the workout experience\n- the different environments for working out in are stunning and easy to get lost in while doing the routines. Can make you feel pretty cool\n- as time has gone by, many more workouts have been added so the early issue of having not that many options is mostly gone\n\n\nCONS:\n- you get a score at the end based on accuracy and power, but theres no clear metric for power. I often reach the end of a song, feeling like I put my all into it, and see 92%. That lack of transparency makes me inclined to not try\n- while I didnt mind the personal trainers too much (and get the feeling you cant mute them for song licensing reasons), half the advice they give is useless. These workouts are NOT personalized, so they just randomly say stuff like check your posture where theyve guessed your posture will be bad. If you need some handholding its fine, but just dont expect what they say to line up to what you do because it almost never did with me\n- there is such a lack of balance in song variety. While its gotten better, almost every workout with rock or punk songs are low or sometimes medium intensity. If you want a difficult workout, I hope you love EDM or pop because very few have a large volume of anything else\n- this is directly to the production team: I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR RIDICULOUS SOCIAL MEDIA WANNABE APP! I like the idea of syncing up for the heart monitoring software but the fact that people can follow me and like my workouts is honestly disturbing and encourages me to stop working out rather than do more.\n- while the workouts are fantastic, some of the squats and lunges are just ... what? As in theyll have huge triangles where the whole point is a minor lunge, but its so big you might as well not move at all. For about half of the higher intensity workouts, I dont know what to do with my body half the time (examples in Bad Romance, War, Are you Gonna Be My Girl)\n- the rejection of gamification tactics. This game encourages you to ignore getting every target and focus on general power and technique instead. No one who owns a VR headset thinks that way. The whole point of a gamified workout is to add in incentives like video games use. Beat Saber works because you fail the track if you miss too many, but also because there are high scores for tracks, encouraging you to try harder next time. By hiding your score til the end and discouraging users to try and hit all the blocks, the game shows a lack of understanding for what its users want/how they think\n- this is it. The beat saber clone is the only workout on this. I was really hoping thered be others that work out different body parts but no, this is all there is\n- the price. I was actually considering a 3-star for this game until I got the $149/yr notification. They charge $19/month or $149/yr, and they think they can do that because they consider themselves a premium exercise experience. The truth is that supernatural is a game. A game on a market where >$40 is considered steep. Premium gyms have tons of different classes and access to equipment, justifying the steep costs. Supernatural has one game and no actual accountability. You could have bad posture the entire time and it would still tell you you did a good job at the end of the workout.\n\nLets be real: supernatural is NOT a premium experience. Its in the same category as the nintendo switchs ringfit adventure and the wiis balance board, both of which were around $80, $90 USD. If this was sold for a flat $80, it would be steep but Id honestly say its not a terrible investment for a decent workout game. I like the idea of this. I like the trainers, I like the workouts, I even like the not-customizable encouragement given. But in the end, this will never be worth a monthly subscription and whoever estimated the value of this companys product needs to be fired.

The coaches. I like that it dynamically scales to your skill level. It has several flaws that make it unenjoyable from a workout perspective.\n\nThere are too many crossovers. You hold a white bat in your right hand and a black bat in your right. Several times throughout a song you will have to hit the cones on the opposite side. This may not sound like a big problem but it really takes you out of the rhythm. This is fine for games like beat saber where you just play the same song over and over mastering the tricky parts. Supernatural should be more like a fun groove that gets your heart rate up. There shouldn't be trick swings. Every swing should fill like a natural extension of the next.\n\nThe next problem has to do with the Quest hardware. Because it tracks your controller with cameras it has some blind spots. You'll notice this a lot with overhead swings. The mappers really need to pay attention to how they want people to move to avoid the headset losing track of people's controllers. Hopefully they are paying attention to which cones people miss the most and adjusting how they map the songs to increase flow and enjoyment.\n\nOtherwise this is a pretty great app. Plenty of good songs. Halfway decent maps. New workouts daily. It doesn't support fitbit which is another downside though. I've cancelled my membership but I'll renew from time to time to see if they've improved the flow of the mapping.\n\nHelpful | 8", "HockshankJun 15 at 12:58 PM\nJust paid for my first month.\n\nThe 30 days were up and I decided it is worth it.

More movement variety and every workout is 360 deg. The trainers have turned out to be better than I thought. Coach Doc with his meditations at the end of the workout and Leanne, well just being Leanne, is awesome. You could put together your own work out with other beat games but this is not a game. This is a gameified workout. The emphasis does seem to be on getting an actual workout. If it turns out to be fun as well... bonus. The music spans from the 80s to 2020 so even this 50 year old dude can sing along to some of these. :) Anyway, as an early doubter I am now sold.

I feel connected to the coaches, and my fellow athletes, and it motivates me to keep going. I can't believe how much I sweat with every workout. I recently got an Apple Watch and am now loving the additional functionality to show my heart rate. It's so amazing to have a PORTABLE gym that you can move to different rooms in your house.

I'd love to be able to speed it up so I could get a better workout.\n\nNot sure what happened to the tracking but mine gets lost all the time lately which totally slows down the game! I can't even play now that its going so slow. I can see my bat going thru the thing but its acting like its not hitting it and then the game slows it down for me. I can't do anything with it going that slow! Its been getting worse the more I play this.. it was really good at a first but now I get so frustrated that I have to stop the game and go play something else that makes me work out. Hopefully you guys can fix this because I've re-calibrated this on my side and its not helping.\n\nI'm having a blast with this! I wanted something to give me a workout and this is doing it! I haven't had any issues with it loading or playing.. its been great! I really like the instructors working with you along the way. I've never really done a Jazzercise class but this is how I am picturing how it would be.. haha. (besides hitting the things). I was always more into weights and never really thought I could do this cardio thing but out in my own yard.. yeah baby! I've really needed some cardio and this has hit the spot! I've been doing it 2x/day for 40 min for the last 4 days and hopefully will continue till I go back to work in 30 days. I can finally feel my endorphins!

While Supernaturals mechanics are similar to Beat Sabers, its goals/focus as an exercise program is different from Beat Sabers as a rhythm game. It does not try to stress mechanical dexterity through complex patterns or flashing speed; instead it tries to stress fitness through patterns that require {a} a full range of motion, {b} squats and lateral lunges, and {c} a full 360 degrees of rotation (your shoulders and quads may ache but your wrists should never be sore).\n\nSUMMARY OF MUSIC:\nMusic is a mix of mostly contemporary music (pop, rock, hip hop, rap, etc) and some ancient music (classic rock, punk, etc). Of all the rhythm games available on VR, Supernatural seems to have the broadest selection of popular songs (hence its relatively high cost) and has been adding more weekly.\n\nSUMMARY OF GUIDED SESSIONS:\nSimilar to BoxVR, Supernatural has coaches who introduce and guide the sessions. How much value the coaches add to the experience will depend on the individual. My experience ranged from neutral (i.e. commentary was just background noise) to slightly positive (i.e. commentary was interesting/encouraging).\n\nSUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE:\nI exercise extensively (2-3 hours daily) through a variety of rhythm games. I generally exercise through routines on the highest difficulty; consequently, my opinions may not be accurate for routines on lower difficulty.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 14 at 4:47 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for taking the time to write us a review.

Thanks again.", "SarachanMay 10 at 11:25 AM\nI love this!\n\nI do a Supernatural workout at least once a day, sometimes twice. It is a great way to exercise with zero friction to get into it... Just put on the Quest and go. (Especially during Coronavirus, with gyms closed, this is very welcome!) The first few times I had sore muscles and had trouble keeping up. After getting used to it, my muscles are less sore, and I am better at keeping up with the patterns, but certainly am not perfect; there is still plenty of challenge. I disagree with reviews that say this is a Beat Saber clone. Although the mechanics are similar, Supernatural is much different and much more. Beat Saber is a game. If you miss a few targets, the round stops, whereas for Supernatural the goal is the workout. The round does not stop if some targets are missed. The addition of squats and lunges makes a tremendous difference in the cardio workout. The Supernatural trainers emphasize using full body or full arms rather than just wrists. The beautiful environments, familiar songs, and \"virtual\" personal trainers all make a big difference. For me it makes a workout something I look forward to and that breaks up a working-from-home quarantine day. (And frankly most of the songs in BS are not to my taste.)\nData speaks more than words. I just ran through the Joy workout, using my Fitbit to measure heartrate. Average level: 128, peak level: 156. I don't think I get to these levels playing any VR games.\nWould I pay the $20 / month subscription fee? Yes, because I get something from Supernatural every day.\nWish list for future improvements: Continued daily new workouts including new songs, Fitbit integration.\n\nHelpful | 5", "flyingwaffleApr 27 at 7:43 AM\n\nI've been doing all my workout in VR for over a year now, with Beat Saber (hard to make it a true workout, because it's really focused on scoring, not on form), Pistol Whip (good for the legs), and The Thrill of the Fight (this is one is very intense, but there's absolutely no guidance on how to do it right).\n\nBut Supernatural is the VR work out I've been waiting for.\nI've been doing it 4 days in a row now (since I signed up for the free trial), and I'm planning to do it every morning, after I wake up.\nIt's really intense without being stressful or frustrating. A single session is enough to leave me totally sweaty, out of breath, and in a good mood.\nHitting the orbs requires some real extension, you can't fake it by just drumming with the controllers (like in Beat Saber), it's not based on memorization either because each workout session is an unpredictable mix of tracks, and that keeps things very fresh and exciting each time.\nThe trainers are great at motivating me and remind me to focus on my breath, and they keep things very positive.\nThe scenery is awesome and varied.\nI was happy to see that some of the tracks are pop classics (like \"Boogie Shoes\").\n\nAbout pricing, to me it's okay - if I do it every day (and I probably will), one workout session is basically 0.67 $, less than the price of a small bag of potato chips from a vending machine.\n\nOn the negative side, occasionally the hits don't register when they should, although it's not as annoying as in other games because this is not about achieving perfection, it's about intensity.\nBut this is probably a generic issue with Quest tracking limitations (present in pretty much all Quest games to some degree) that could be improved.\n\nSo, overall, I'm really happy this exists.\n\nHelpful | 9", "JustbeianApr 27 at 10:03 AM\nLike Apple decided to make Beat Saber\n\nUPDATE: Still greatly enjoying this a few days later. Glad this is the case.\n\nTo be honest, when it comes to workout apps on VR, I feel like I had to choose between doing something fun or getting in a good workout. With Supernatural I dont feel like I have to choose anymore. If youre looking for more of a fitness app similar to exercise classes based on some rhythm (like Zumba), then this is perfect. It feels super polished and is one of the best workout apps on the Quest in my opinion. I was worried it would be just a reskinned Beat Saber, but Supernatural really is just a different experience altogether.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed it a lot. Now I know part of it is a novelty factor with it being new so Ill have to see how I feel after playing the songs/courses after a few weeks, but I will say that this app has really hit it out of the park for me. My suggestion would be to give it a chance - it does have a 30-day free trial after all. If you don't feel like it's worth paying for then don't pay for it. But I think many people will be pleasantly surprised.\n\nHelpful | 9", "Riff45Apr 27 at 6:00 PM\nAn actual workout\n\nI never write reviews but I felt I had to here. Anyone who is saying this is a beat saber clone or another music rhythm game is not understanding what this is. You arent hitting blocks in tune with music, you are doing a workout tailored to you individually. Difficulty ramps up based on how youre doing, and the workouts are designed not to test your rhythm or accuracy but to make your entire body move the way it would in a real workout.\n\nIts not a game. You cant go into it expecting to play a game. Go into it the same way you would a spin class or a condition class.

The environments are awesome, music is good but repetative, and I actually liked the coaching to some degree. However the ability for this app to auto adjust to your ability is just not there. The objects flying around as the session ramps up is just dizzying. Also the balance between upper and lower body just did not seem to be there.

Despite the inevitable beat sabre comparison, you should think of this vs a pelaton sub, or gym membership rather than vs a game. If you find you use it daily, its worth it and its easy enough to find out with the 30 day trial. Only thing i find a bit cheap is the lack of family linked accounts on the same main device.

If you are keeping up, send more!\n\nThe music selection was not anything I ever heard before (Gen X'er - not that much into music), so that was not as enjoyable as it could be.\n\nIf were $25 and I owned the game, I would not be disappointed. The subscription model felt a like a health club membership I never used. I canceled on the last day of the trial because I had not come back to it for a couple weeks.\n\nI *have* become addicted to BeatSaber and play that almost every day. Not exactly the same, but I started out on Easy, and progressed on some of the songs to Normal, to Advanced and when I am done with a song, my heartrate is definitely elevated.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 10 at 8:22 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback. Did you get a chance to do the low-intensity workouts (with the \"L\" icon)? They're perfect for folks that are new to Supernatural and want to make sure they're getting a full follow-through on their swings and performing the squats and lunges correctly. If not, give those a shot and let us know what you think at support@getsupernatural.com. Thanks also for the note about the music. We've had a pretty eclectic mix of songs/genres thus far so you might want to check out some other workouts like Retrofit that feature a specific genre (you'll get a good idea of what type of music to expect from the workout descriptions). Our Dynamic Difficulty setting is an evolving system but it is designed so that the more workouts you do over time, the more you'll notice that your Supernatural experience is tailored to your skill/fitness level.

This is much more of a fitness class or a discount personal trainer program than a game. If you already have a fitness routine that works for you or if you regularly attend classes at a gym, then you probably wont value this. Im at a point in my life where, due to work and kids, I find it very difficult to schedule fitness classes, go to the gym, or schedule personal trainer appointments. I mostly use my quest for exercise. I have trouble motivating myself to run or do traditional cardio. Supernatural is perfect for me. It is fun, much more so than competing vr exercise programs like boxvr. It is much better and more well rounded exercise than games like beatsaber. And it is so much cheaper than a personal trainer (when I had more time, I used to spend several hundred a month on personal training). This is not going to be as good exercise as a personal trainer or a good fitness class at a gym, but it is so much more convenient for those of us with excessively busy schedules. Time will tell if this will offer enough variety to keep me engaged in the long run. But, for now, this is my favorite new thing.\n\nHelpful | 9", "yungusApr 25 at 10:14 AM\n5 Stars Across the Board\n\nThis game has it all. The visuals are spectacular and the overall flow of the experience makes it quite addicting. The level of concentration mixed with the fun and engaging atmosphere will have you sweating and forgetting that youre even working out. Your whole body will feel the burn after 20 minutes. For the people complaining about $19/mo, who cares? This is a commitment to health and fitness and if $240/year is not worth being your best, then spend it at a McDonalds.\n\nHelpful | 9", "micael_carvalhoJun 6 at 11:49 PM\nNice at first; disappointing after\n\nThe game is subscription-based. Understandable, since they're paying people to \"pretend to be workout coaches\", and also use paid songs. But the price is too high for the problems in the following\n\n1. No recentering. I was hitting my lamp in full swings, so I pressed the Oculus button to recenter and the app crashed. Had to go through the entire menu + warmup before getting back to where I was, no resume possible. Feels like an alpha release\n\n2. Coaches are 2D videos. Move around, there is no depth, their centering in the mat is off, they slide away when you move. Doesn't even look like a dual camera recording\n\n3. No feedback on the player. Coach kept saying \"very good\", \"excellent\", and I wasn't moving at all. This is only voice, no video; why not record a separate voice track saying something motivational for players lagging behind? Pause the game and play a message! You are charging a hefty price that is higher than a single game purchase per month, act like it\n\n4. No way to adjust the level. A newbie would miss on half or more of the workouts because even for me they cannot be fully completed; I play expert++ in other games and I cannot deal with some here (??)\n\n5. Sometimes impossible to get right. This Saturday's workout had some swings that are physically impossible to accomplish: my controllers would shatter from the speed, or it required my arms to cross each other without touching. How can such a level be released without anyone testing that a 100% score is possible? I got so demotivatedthat I abandoned the game  closed it and went to play something else\n\n6. Swing detection is garbage. I cannot stress this enough. Sometimes the swing is perfect, and visually your bat went the right way and touched the target, but and the game doesn't recognize it, target passes the bat like it was invisible and misses it\n\n7. Haptic feedback on bad swings is even worse  only a \"plop\" sound from the balloon going away, no vibration or anything. Feels extremely unnatural\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 7 at 7:00 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback. We'd love to connect with you on the issues that you're experiencing as it sounds like you might be experiencing some calibration issues. You can re-calibrate at anytime via the Settings menu. To recenter your platform, you'd have to press and hold the Menu button on your right Oculus Touch controller. It does sound like you might benefit from starting with some of the low-intensity workouts as they're a great way to ease into the Supernatural fitness experience.

If the music was your own music and you just changed the environments i would pay 40 for the game but its not worth 20 ever. 20 a month isnt worth it.

You're not paying for a game, you're paying for a gym membership.

Of course I want it to be cheaper, but if the quality of the workouts stay on par with what I have done so far it might just be worth it.\n\nFor those comparing the price to other games.

Alot of people are complaining about the $20.00 a month subscription its 0.65 cents per day and if you follow your trainer it well give you a great workout!

I am in a full sweat when I am done. I feel the full body workout every time and in different areas. In the beginning I wasnt fast enough to nail all targets but I keep doing it everyday and I became faster, stronger and am able to keep up now. For those of you who say you cant hit the targets that well and blame the game its probably because you cant handle it and you need to keep working hard. I think its worth the $19 a month and I plan on paying. For you people to say that paying it is laughable is disgusting. People work hard on these games and you wouldnt have them if they didnt. I love VR and am willing to support these games any way I can. Everyone has to make a living. I cant wait for more songs.

I also like the trainer presence and surprisingly find them helpful (I thought that part might not be for me!).\n\nI know a lot of people struggle with the idea, but the subscription model equates to a gym membership to me. And I really have never been able to drag myself into gyms, but beautiful landscapes? Yes please. So this is definitely worth it for me.\n\nAs long as it means the team can add content, great music and keep it fresh then it makes sense to me. Good luck to the dev team!\n\nHelpful | 9", "jt3432Apr 24 at 8:06 AM\nStill needs work...\n\nI sort of wanted to rate this two stars, but I am trying to not be mean just because I was so frustrated with the game & app. I liked the concept & tracking and it does get your heart rate up, but the play and bugs were super frustrating. Add the monthly cost in and I really don't know if this is a keeper. I get an equally good workout playing Beat Sabers and I have better control of the difficulty. Maybe at $10 a month I might not hesitate since there are some part of the play that I do like better than Beat Sabers as a workout game.\n\nI almost uninstalled the game because you can not exit out of the tutorial. If you can exit it was not working for me. I pushed every button, held every button and ended up having to sit through the tutorial four times to get to the main menu because I mistakenly restarted the tutorial three times. Clicking too fast and stuff I guess. The only option I could figure out was to completely exit and restart. It did not seem to remember that I had done the tutorial for a couple times. When it did, I found the wording a bit confusing and ended up doing the tutorial again. It should say something like \"Start tutorial!\" and not just \"Get Started\" or what ever it said. Guess I'm a bit slow and click too fast, but when a game makes me feel stupid I think the game is stupid, just being honest. It is a workout for goodness sake, not brain teaser. If I do this right after getting up I really don't want to have to think too much. Nit picking, I know.\n\nIn the tutorial and workout it kept losing tracking of the hand units. Loading was slow and some times the play was jerky. Might be misunderstanding dynamic, but this game did not seem to adapt for me. I did the morning work out and the game play was too hard but the activity level was fine. Like to see difficulty better indicator or a way to set the difficultly. For now, I would say Beat Sabers is a better buy, but if they drop the cost and fix the bug maybe.\n\nHelpful | 7", "mahk.mack.9May 25 at 1:00 AM\nCould be good, but not as it is now\n\nThis app DESPERATELY needs a \"beginner\" and \"intermediate\" level. It has some great upsides; like beautiful scenery and life-like in-game trainers, but it's difficulty to the beginning user is way too hard.\nI will use two well-known apps to explain and compare: In BoxVR the difficulty lies in the physical effort to hit the targets with good form while in BeatSaber the difficulty lies in the speed, dexterity, and pattern memorization/anticipation needed to hit the targets. Supernatural combines both of these concepts BUT does so at the PRO level right from the start. Imagine picking up BeatSaber for the first time and playing five, back-to-back songs you've never heard before at \"Expert+ 360\" while trying to put serious force behind each swing. That is what Supernatural is. Complexity and pattern memorization detract from, not add-to, exercise. I highly suggest they allow users to play one song at a time, a-la BeatSaber, so they may gain confidence and gradually move up to multi-song sessions.\nMusic is subjective and some may like what the app offers. If the $20.00 per MONTH price is due to music-royalties I say skip them and use generic tracks. Or make the main-app a one-time purchase and sell artist-specific bonus packs like BeatSaber does. $20.00 per month is far too much for music I don't care about.\nFinally, and this is again personal preference, I find it much more satisfying to punch a target with speed and force in BoxVR than I do hitting balloons with bats in Supernatural. I find the former to be more primal and satisfying, but that may be just me. Conversely BoxVR has no excuse for not upping their background visuals to match the great ones in Supernatural.\nIn short the devs need to flatten the steep learning curve and drastically change the pay-structure if they want to appeal to the masses instead of a small, select group. Best of luck to them. Personally I won't be paying $20.00 a month for this.\n\nHelpful | 4", "MassCApr 23 at 5:21 PM\nWorth it?\n\nFeels like a great cardio workout, but I agree with most other reviewers who said it's expensive. Much cheaper than a gym, but most people that will play this are not gym customers: so not used to pay a monthly fee for to work out.\n\nI'd be willing to pay a small monthly fee like 2-3$, on top of a possible 15-20$ app price, I would hardly pay the 20 unless the developer has the intention of returning that price to the customer with more features, events etc.\n\nI will try it for this free month, I doubt I'll stay afterwards unless the price model changes.\n\nHelpful | 2", "znanneyMay 12 at 5:52 AM\nWorth it! (For me)\n\nThis isn't a game so much as a solid workout app. Sure, we can compare to Beat Saber, BoxVR, or Synth Riders, but those are games. This app is very well polished and using a Garmin fitness tracker, Supernatural provides a much better workout than other VR games. The daily workouts, excellent tracks, beautiful environments, and the trainers in my ear really help with the motivation. I'm mostly sedentary and this app keeps me coming back daily for more.\n\nI see a lot of people talking about the $240 a year, but that's not what it is. You're not signing an annual contract and if there's a month where you're not feeling it, cancel and resume at a later date.\n\nThis app is all about perspective and it's definitely not for everyone, just like not everyone enjoys the gym, not everyone subscribes to Peloton or Spotify.\n\nDo the free trial, see if it's for you, and move on. Regardless of how anyone feels about the subscription model, the app is so well done with top notch music it's worth experiencing and you've got a full 30 days to see what it's about.\n\nAt this point in time, the app is worth it to me. Maybe later if I'm looking for more, that value will change, but I haven't spent a penny on it yet and it's one of the only apps I'm currently using on the Quest.\n\nHelpful | 4", "SpetkaMay 2 at 8:17 PM\nIm horrible at it, but...\n\nHeres the thing. For a gamer, my hand eye coordination is pretty much trash. I cannot register which hand is which when they start throwing like a million of those things at me. I thought this would discourage me. I thought seeing myself at the bottom of a leader board over and over again would be the death of me. Something about this app is different though. Many of the exercises adjust to your pace without letting you tap the breaks completely. Instead of fighting my own ego, Im setting goals of getting out of bronze. I am my own worst mental enemy, but the way this is set up, seriously negates thats. Im not even sure how. I am absolutely astounded that Im more sore from this then I was from the gym. You think the first day, okay I did break a sweat, but come on. It has a way of working absolutely everything. You dont even really realize till you start to feel sore. I thought, okay this is cool but how much can it really work all of my body. It just does. Go for it. As a person who has given up on my own fitness time and time again because I cant meet my own ridiculous expectations, this is the medicine for that. Its got a certain charm and incentive I havent found anywhere else (and I have sure as heck wasted the money trying). Kick in to the new wave of home fitness. I promise youre muscles, whole body and mind wont regret a thing.\n\n\nAll that being said. There are a few things I have to say are drawbacks.\n\n-There is some inconsistency in hitting the targets. There are times, even on slow warm ups where I continually do the same thing and sometimes it hits, sometimes it doesnt. Lighting up the room a lot is good for it, but this still happens quite consistently.\n-I know Im bad, but there needs to be a little give for people who are not great with registering targets close together and switching non stop. When you have three opening portals having you switch your way around non stop it just gets a bit overwhelming if you just kind of suck at it. I just focus on the things I can remember the most and the difficult adjusts overtime sometimes. But I start strong because sometimes they beginning pace is just perfect, then it cranks it up 10 notches and my solid pace turns into a panic. It takes a while for it to back off again, if it ever does. The dynamic difficulty is cool, but I think there needs to be a real push to target how much people can handle the rapid pace. Give a few more options for more controlled starts and work outs rather than just beginners only. I hate feeling like if I do well right out the gate, that means in about 20 seconds Im gonna be overwhelmed by targets again. I want a strong experience all the way through for more of the workouts without redoing beginners only.\n- The trainers are a bit much. It does an incredible job of syncing your hits to the beat, and hearing somewhat consistent talking through it is annoying. Sure I want some type of tips here and there, but there needs to be some way to adjust how often they talk, if at all. It seems nit-picky, but part of what really keeps me going is when Ive got the words in my head, Ive figured out the pattern and I just want to go for it.\n- Some more explanation on the power stat would help a ton. I focus on it non stop to try and see what Im doing to get it up. I like power. It really gives me more out of the workout, but an in game guided something to help you understand how its calculated and give you some calibrated feed back would be incredible. I dont want to cheat the system. I just want the power to be accurate to the amount I can really do individually. I want to see where these numbers come from because while they kind of make sense now, I do believe this could be done better.\n- The cool downs make little sense in game. I dont want to rock back my head back and forth and do all that with my headset on, but maybe thats just me. What I would love to see is a guided cool down once you take off the headset with the app. If you are tacking, have it after you hold stop tracking. If not, just have a little section that is populated given the workout(s) you completes that session. Then it can be longer and more targeted at what you did for the whole workout.\n\nHelpful | 6", "dominhydeApr 24 at 11:04 AM\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nEvery other 1 star review has said it all already.

It takes good ideas from games like Beat Saber and Pistol Whip ... and focuses on fitness. The idea of regular influxes of new music, digital coaches and uninterrupted exercise seems great.\n\nBig problem though. They want to charge $20 every month for this.\n\nI have been reading the justifications in various forums. They fall flat. This pricing is offensive.\n\nThe coaches are not live with you. They are digital assets. Recorded beautifully, but still assets. They have algorithms that I expect they will update over time to keep their users motivated. But this is expected for an app these days.\n\nNintendo's Ring Fit Adventute has more fitness activites with actual resistance AND includes coaching AND you only have to pay once.\n\nIf not for the pricing, this app would be a solid 3 or 4 stars. With typical app updates I could see it eventually being 4 or 5 stars. But as it is today, l will keep using other apps for my fitness goals.\n\nUPDATE\n----\n\nOkay, so I have continued using this app to see how well it works. I really love using VR for exercise, so if this App works and the price comes into alignment with reality I could see it helping people.\n\nBut they need to fix a few problems:\n\n1. This is not Beat Saber. It is a fitness app. The levels should be designed to keep you moving, but not in a way that has you missing blocks because the patterns get tricky. More repetition of shorter patterns would be better for this.\n\n2. This app supports my heart rate monitor (Polar H10) for about 5 minutes. Then it just reports the last number it got. The pairing with the Polar H10 was troublesome as well. If I have to use the companion app to restart monitoring every 5 minutes, that's not a good experience.\n\n3. The collision detection is spotty. I frequently hit the target hard, but it doesn't register the hit. I literally swing through it. I play Beat Saber and get perfect songs, so I think there might be a bug here.\n\n4. The signup process is painful! I did the intro before signing up. Then I signed up and had to so the intro again. Then, on the last step of the intro, the app couldn't load the next video and I had to restart. So, I got to do the intro again. This needs to be skippable. As a matter of fact, all talking and warmup/cooldown sessions should be skippable.\n\nThe price is still a no-go for me, but I will continue to give this app a chance during their free trial.

I never thought I would actually enjoy working out again, and then I found Supernatural. I love the coaches, especially Ranier! Ive have to say, the quality of Supernatural is not only superior to that of any other VR Fitness app, but Id go as far as saying any VR app. Its truly beautiful. I also highly respect that Supernatural is licensing the music from labels. The new workouts keep things fresh and exciting. I love that I can workout from home and Im excited that Ill be able to take it with me when I start to travel again!\n\nHelpful | 5", "PruisimMay 4 at 9:21 PM\nAmazing App\n\nFantastic app similar to beat saber but way different it is much more of a workout and I leave dripping sweat. You should be able to chose your workout by category easy, medium etc. because the dynamic learning mode is garbage and your half way through exhausted from all the lunges and squats but it doesnt slow down for a second. So either you feel like your soul is crushed cause there is no way to catch up or your like me and just stand there till the feeling of throwing up subsides and you keep going. I also notice when I get tired my form gets horrible my lunges are off and my knee starts hurting but it doesnt slow down. It should learn when your tired when you start missing the orbs and actually either slow down orrrr reduce how many squats you do till you can actually catch up. Another tip hand tracking would be great because sometimes the tracking gets lost on faster songs and you think you have a bat in your hand but its just floating there. Overall good app and if I truly lose fat youve got my $20 a month.

So far for me, it has. I had tried to construct a workout out of Beat Saber and BoxVR but it didn't stick.\n\nSupernatural has a couple of things that has gotten me doing it every day. Better songs, I mean I like thumping techno actually, but this has way better variety. Human trainer, it might feel a touch gimmicky but it does genuinely help me come back. Variable difficulty, I'm still not sure how it works but from a heart rate perspective it does, it gets me into a good high heart rate zone and keeps me there for the workout. New playlists everyday, rather than have to think what I want to do, I just do the new playlist each day.

Only difference is the environment and some trainer talking over the music that totally throws you out of the song and is just annoying. There is no reason this needs to be such a costly monthly subscription for something that already exists. I can do the exact same workout in beat saber or synth rider so this is not anything new. $20 each month...absolutely not. If it was $20 a year, maybe but still not convinced.

It comes down to hit box (technical) issues and general enjoyment. Add on the fact they want $20/mo (annual subscription has been offered for cheaper) and I just dont think this will find its niche. Supernatural distinguishes itself with a live coach (not too useful), great scenery (doesnt matter when youre hitting balloons), and radio hits (royalty fees wasted IMO). The only thing I get from this app that I dont get from others is a leg workout.\n\nBottom line: if this is the ONLY workout app you own, it may be worth it. Otherwise Id pass.\n\n-\nSummary: During Stay-at-Home this can easily replace the gym membership for conditioning workouts. $20/month is the cost of a meal, not a big ask but can be if compared with other apps on the VR market now. BOXVR, Thrill of the Fight are major competitors; this experience does seem to bite off Beat Saber success with a more fitness focused element. Its a very engaged workout and you can tell the devs are shaping this to be more in the future as long as they dont abandon the project. Links with Apple Watch and other devices for heart rate tracking which is convenient. I workout daily as part of my job and this has me at an elevated heart rate during the workout.\n\nPROS:\n- design and aesthetics are amazing and beyond most VR apps (especially Quest limitations)\n- fitness instructors provide beneficial advice during the workout and are motivating (if you want to mute them, not your app\n- plenty of workouts to choose from with increasing technical difficulties\n- workouts arent faddish, you will definitely get a similar experience to Peloton or other group fitness workouts.\n- workouts do a great job of targeting multiple muscle groups, pushing the limits of VR capabilities that dont have full body tracking\n\nCONS:\n- feels like the project isnt fully there yet for the monthly subscription; add boxing or something other than bats because it does get monotonous after a few days. A one-stop shop app can corner the market but not if you have other major competitors out there\n- tracking can be off especially when controllers are off screen for quick hits after a triangle feature.\n- app should add kcal/calorie burner to completion stats. More can be done here\n\nKeep up the work, excited to see future updates by the time I hit 30 days.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Strider22May 2 at 4:10 PM\nLoving it so far!\n\nCurrently trying to get the full use out of this game while my 30 day trial lasts.\n\nWith so many other subscriptions based services, I do wish this didn't follow that trend. Also understand why it might be that way if the coaches and content continues to grow. Still, $19/mo feels a little steep when you think of the long run.\n\nI've heard reports that it feels like a rip-off of beat saber, but the visuals and twist of this game is so much more satisfying, especially for someone craving a workout since I'm stuck indoors.\n\nOverall I'm really happy with the game after being about 1 week in.

Id much rather play that for $30 and have custom songs than pay $20 a month for this. I pity the person who gets suckered into paying more than that once this founders discount is over. The free silicon liner is cool I guess. Dont buy this past the free trial.\n\nUPDATE:\nI decided to give supernatural a chance for a workout, so I picked the tough option that was 25 minutes long. Wish there were longer options but whatever. It was just one off songs playing with the coach giving random advice that didnt actually matter to me. After 3-4 songs, the app completely crashed and the workout was ruined. I needed up just finishing in beatsaber and had much more fun actually picking my songs.

I'm not opposed to that business model, it's just that what I've seen so far doesn't live up to its promise.\n\nThe ideal version of this would be great - carefully curated songs and well-designed maps that use the slash-targets mechanic to get you moving and work different muscles, all compressed into 20 minute workout playlists - this could be perfect for someone who'd like to put on a headset and get a quick workout with fresh songs every day, knowing that the selections would actually make you move your body and raise your heart rate. And some of the workouts I've tried do this very well. The best maps seem to be tailored to encourage wide, open-arm movements with sweeping follow-through, and the targets are placed in a way to encourage room-scale movement, including turns, squats, and lunges, and most maps seem designed to work your lower body. However, some of the faster tracks fall into the \"wrist flicking\" category with targets coming so fast that full-body movement is not possible. This could be fixed by more careful mapping, of course, but it's disappointing to see this type of map in the first few workouts I've tried.\n\nI understand why the app focuses on curated workouts, and won't give you a full song list (I imagine this has to do with music licensing as well), but it would be nice to have a practice or song-select mode.\n\nThe photogrammetry backgrounds are nice, though there seem to be a fairly limited number of them, and the coaches voiceover is actually helpful rather than annoying as I'd feared.\n\nUltimately it'll only be worth a subscription to me if they can dial-in the mapping better and avoid the beat-saber-expert-plus wrist-flicking in favor of maps that encourage smoother movement.\n\nUpdate: going to cancel before they can charge me; the last couple workouts I've tried have just compounded my complaints above.\n\nHelpful | 4", "MakusheMay 31 at 8:28 AM\nNice Start - needs more development imo\n\nI love the sceneries, I think the mapping is great most of the time. I wish I could mute the trainers at times because when Im in a flow I seem to mess up when the trainer starts talking about form or endurance and my thoughts shift to those things as balls are flying at me and suddenly Im missing the targets.\n\nMost importantly I dont feel Ive worked out after a workout. I feel Ive succeeded in striking targets.\nI do however get my cardio in so I guess we can count that as a workout?\n\nThere has to be something for me to gage how powerful my strikes are along the way because honestly I dont know. In BoxVR I can see point values and green points for more precise/powerful strikes. In RacketNX I am rewarded with hard strikes as I see the direct influence I have by the visual and audio effect directly related to my hit. I need feedback and not at the end of the session. This can be a feature to toggle on/off as desired.\n\nI am not a fan on most of the music on this app and that also affects my workout. I have to deal with songs that Im coming to loathe from hearing again and again. Songs I never liked in the first place. Being able to use our own purchased songs would be lovely.\n\nI think the trainers are wonderful and full of life and good vibes- I wish them all well and hope this app will morph into something everyone will come to love and enjoy on a daily basis. I think I will give it another month and see if any changes are made.\n\nI also enjoy the scoreboard as it encourages me to keep working out (although I feel Im just striking targets). Im not sore after a workout on here but I am sore after boxing or playing RacketNX.\n\nHelpful | 0", "smith.rustyMay 7 at 6:58 AM\nA fantastic work out that's actually fun\n\nA lifelong 'gym rat', I've generally avoided at-home workout systems. Those that I have tried, I have lost interest after just a few workouts (everything from dvds back in the day to more recently evolved streaming workouts). But, I actually like these workouts a lot. And the more I do them, the better I get. Which has made them more fun for me.\n\nThe landscapes are breathtaking and I love the music playlists. But even better than that are the actual workouts. They are really challenging in terms of speed and being accurate; which gives me something to work towards.\n\nThe workouts are full-body and are similar to a HIIT class you'd take at a gym. I end up getting my heart rate as high or sometimes higher then I would on my own in a gym or even with a personal trainer. And the workout is over before I know it.\n\nAs a beta user I had tried Supernatural a few times at home and then, on a whim, threw my oculus in my bag for a business trip to NYC. It's always difficult to workout on business trips so I thought I'd give this a try to see how it would work.\n\nI set it up the space between two beds in my small NYC hotel room and ended up using it every day I was there, without breaking or hitting anything in the room. It turned out to be a fantastic solution.\n\nSince then I've been working out with Supernatural 3-4 times a week and still enjoy all the new workouts and trainers.\n\nGenuinely a challenging workout that is actually fun.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseMay 7 at 12:20 PM\n\nThanks for the feedback.

We'd love to hear it.", "blert23May 5 at 8:28 AM\njust what i'd hoped it would be\n\nI was looking forward to this and it was exactly as advertised. Beautiful, immersive settings (curious to see if they'll be adding any \"fantasy worlds\" to it for variation), fun and current music, upbeat and friendly trainers. Hitting the targets were calibrated perfectly. In terms of the trainers, I fall into the camp of liking hearing them talking and doling out relevant bits of advice along the way (lower your shoulders, lighter on your feet, like that). I imagine after a while if you have favorite workouts that you want to return to, you'd want the option to turn the trainer companion off. Tip--although you are turning 360, the ends of the long \"bats\" that you're swinging seem to be what's triggering the guardian to pop up, not because you're actually close to it (you're only turning in a stationary circle). I will experiment with making the guardian larger than i normally would so that it doesn't pop up every time I swing, which broke the immersion a bit. Just have to remember to bring it back in before a different game! I love the apple watch/phone sync and seeing my heart rate on the screen that pops up in between workouts, everything about the app pairing process was easy and worked. Price-wise, I think the value in a subscription for you will depend on whether you're a gym person or not, and how consistent you want to be with your workouts. Not a gym person here, so i'm excited to try challenging myself to keep up with the daily workouts and I hope this concept takes off. NOTE: happy to follow up as requested--making the guardian a little bigger than the space would dictate worked GREAT! Much more immersive not seeing it popping up. Really do have to remember to put it back though, so no hitting furniture. ;o)\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseMay 1 at 11:21 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the review.

Love the backdrops and the excellent coaching and interactions with the player . Yes it has a subscription model but you really have to think about what this is . They are promising regular workout updates plus catering to a very niche market so Id imagine that means a higher cost needed per player to maintain. Im gonna try this trail out and get an idea of what kind of updates they deliver to see if the sub is worth keeping. Note on the gameplay: would love some feedback from the ones that have you follow the tail with your controller .

However, the app seems to be at odds with the message. This is supposed to be a workout that focuses on form and power, as is stressed in the intro. However, many of the songs just fill the screen with targets and create a situation where you are just trying to hit all of the targets. This leads to a Beat Saber type situation where you feel sweating because you are flailing your arms, but you are not getting a good work out. For instance, in today's work Perfect Day one of the first songs had limited targets and a cool rhythm section that forced you to slam the bats up and down and allowed me to focus on power, which caused my heart rate to jump into zone 5. The next few songs contrasted that with a whole lot of targets and a whole lot of arm flailing, leading me to drop my heart rate to zone 4. I get that there is this dynamic difficulty setting, but I dont want this to be Beat Saber I want it to be more like Box VR, where you have time to focus on hitting targets and power. Unfortunately, although I like the polish of this, and it can be fun, I am going to go back to Box VR for its core dynamics and cost.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseApr 30 at 6:12 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for giving us a shot.

Ive played quite a few rhythm-based games that could be considered moderate exercise (Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, BoxVR) and this game kicked my butt.\n\nContrary to most other games of the genre, it makes full use of a 360 degree space. This feels like it encourages you to think about where your feet are at all times and reminds you to engage your whole body.\n\nI could see how the voice of the trainer could be off-putting for some,but I found it to be encouraging when my energy was flagging, and there is a real emphasis on mindfulness and positivity that I found refreshing.\n\nIm eager to see how this game continues to develop in coming weeks.\n\nHelpful | 2", "nobleAlchemistApr 24 at 8:37 AM\nI'm just judging by the free workout\n\nI feel a lot of ppl are reviewing this by this by the monthly price, which is not fair.

Its (relatively) fun, has decent music, the environments are good, and is a great workout. I can burn about 11-12 calories per minute playing it. There are a few things that would make the game a lot better though.\n\nFirstly, $20 a month for a VR game is insane considering its just over glorified Beat Saber with a bit of Google Earth. If the price were lowered to $10 Id most likely play longer than the trial.\n\nSecond, the coaches are a good addition for motivation and all that. But the fact that they keep talking during every song is extremely distracting, especially on some of the faster/harder songs. If you go to the settings, you can only lower their volume to half. If you do that, theyre still sometimes louder than the song, even with music volume at 100%. There should be an option to either mute them during a song or mute them entirely.\n\nThird, the songs. The songs are ok. Not my personal favorites but still pretty good. However, we should be able to play one song at a time instead of an entire workout and be able to choose any of the ones already in the game. It would not be hard to do, just make a separate menu for individual songs.\n\nFourth, the patterns. The patterns feel a bit awkward at times or not having a great flow. But the biggest problems with the patterns is sometimes there are so many orbs so close together that you would have to sacrifice accuracy for power. This is very frequent and typically ends with something like 95% accuracy and only 75% power.\n\nFifth, we need varying difficulty. I dont mean intensity, I mean technical difficulty (triangles and orbs) we should be able to make the game easier from that standpoint.\n\nSixth, We should be able to make custom levels. I know that this would be very hard to pull off, maybe even impossible, but if we could it might just make the game worth it.\n\nSeventh, a few quality of life improvements we should have are an option to disable 360 or have a small room mode, and we should be able to change the colors.\n\nThanks for reading.

Boning up on beat saber probably helped my coordination with its campaign mode. Wish there was a similar training program that helps you intuitively get better quicker in this workout program.

Im not even as bothered by the $20/m price point as other reviewers seem to be if the app is reliable with new content/songs/workouts regularly.\n\nHowever, the reliability is really the Achilles Heel of this app. My major complaint is the game crashes near constantly (usually gets stuck in a loading screen) to the point its impossible to get through a complete workout. Even with multiple restarts of the app, it usually only takes about 5 minutes of gameplay for me to get stuck somewhere and needing to close out. That makes this app essentially unusable until this is fixed, hopefully ASAP.\n\nTwo other notes - the tracking isnt 100% accurate to the point theres just something thatll feel off with some targets youre hitting and missing. That combined with really needing a ton of confident 360 degree space around you. Because of those two factors I found myself not being as bold in my movements as I could/should be - itd be great if a 180 degree mode/ option were introduced so the core swings could still be there without needing the full 360.\n\nRooting for this app but Im hoping these reliability fixes are made ASAP, otherwise Ill be jumping ship after the trial.\n\nEDIT 1: An additional note - there seems to be something off with how the game syncs with Apple Watch, Im still having calories counting and I closed out of the game hours ago  pretty sure I didnt burn 2,000 calories today...\n\nHelpful | 5", "GTR_GVLApr 24 at 10:51 AM\nGood app bad business model\n\nPlayed it a couple times.

But thats an ask, not a flaw with the design as it stands. Really, the only complaint is that, at $20 per month, you lose most of the convenience of an in-home workout. At that price point, there are numerous other competitors that are cheaper and comparable in quality that Ill be willing to explore when the trial expires.\n\nHelpful | 1", "JStull95Jul 26 at 9:30 AM\nWorth it!\n\nSo motivating and worth every penny!\n\nHelpful | 1", "captainkwApr 29 at 8:24 PM\nBad Romance kicked my as*\n\nI have played a lot of Beat Saber maps and VR archery workout games, but Supernatural really kicked my as*. That featured workout today \"Dark Forces\" got dark real quick and I haven't feel this tired since the quarantine began, yet can't stop feeling awesome about the bad romance I just had (yah they actually licensed the full Lady Gaga song). The hits were on beat and on point and I feel like a hip-hop dancer. I took hip-hop classes when I was younger and living in Austin, TX and totally sucked at it. But today I kicked as*. Incredible workout.\n\nHelpful | 5", "RealitySmithApr 29 at 1:35 PM\nA great workout, and only getting better\n\nI wanted to wait a few days to write my review, since I was a bit skeptical of Supernatural at first. I come from playing tons of Beat Saber at Expert+ level, and BoxVR/Pistol Whip for other exercise. I wasnt too optimistic for this app after seeing that it would be a subscription service, but I wanted to try it anyway.\n\nLet me start this review by saying that any other review that says the subscription price is ridiculous is completely ungrounded right now, because everyone that owns this experience is still on the 30 day free trial, so nobody has spent a penny. Despite that, we continue to get new workouts *every single day* and already several updates. Theres no reason to complain about the price yet when its free and they havent even been given a chance to deserve that subscription money.\n\nHonestly, Supernatural is an amazing workout. I spent almost every day playing an hour of Beat Saber each morning, but was exhausted after only 30 minutes of Supernatural. The workouts are intense and dynamic to adapt to your skill, and the squats are brutal and make me work in ways that Best Saber never did. The emphasis in power and broad slashes with the bats are nice too, it works more of my arms and shoulders. Beat Saber tends to be more about wrist movement than large arm swings.\n\nI think that Supernatural is also doing enough right now to differentiate it from experiences like Beat Saber. Sure, there are some similar core mechanics, but the scoring is completely different (power per hit is far more important), the dynamic difficulty is awesome, squats and lunges during workouts are unique, and the overall emphasis on fitness sets it apart.\n\nSpeaking of the emphasis on fitness, this is very clearly a fitness app, compared to beat saber which is very clearly a rhythm game with the benefit of fitness. Supernatural has coaches (and if you dont like them, you can just turn their volume off) for every single workout, that constantly remind you of proper form and what to focus on. Scoring is based on workout quality, and the heart-rate tracking and post-workout stats are absolutely amazing. Not to mention the custom app ecosystem and competitive weekly leaderboards.\n\nAdmittedly, this game still has a few bugs and issues, but theyre being addressed quickly. I sent an email with tons of feedback to the support team and received a fast reply addressing most of it, so its clear the team is already committed to constantly improving the app. And honestly, Im willing to forgive a slightly unstable launch that gets better over time, because Supernatural is exactly the workout I was looking for while being stuck at home.\n\nAgain, theres no reason to complain about the price right now since theres a 30 day free trial, but Ive already been impressed with the new and differentiated workouts each day. As much as I would love to have features like the ability to play individual songs and per-song leaderboards, I realize that I only want that because Im so used to Beat Saber, and I think that Supernatural is really going all-in on being an exercise experience, which may just be exactly the right move.\n\nHelpful | 5", "LoudfireApr 29 at 8:22 AM\nSweating so hard! Loving the music\n\nBig fan of oh shape and beat saber. This game Takes the Cake! I love all the coaches and the input they give as you move your body. It is spot-on. The music is great. Been a while since I've been pumping like this! Word of advice when you set up your workout station use a small yoga mat and line it up with the yoga mat on the ground in the workout. It will keep you tactically focused on the safe Zone area! Keeping this as a subscription definitely worth the $20 a month.

It's fun and gives me something to look forward to everyday to de-stress. I love the environments that the workouts are set in to remind me of some of my travels. My heart rate is usually within 150-170 bpm each workout.\n\nThe difficulty setting sometimes was a bit off and it felt like I was flailing a bit, but I think they've since fixed the algorithm. It was also hard to get used to the black and white color balls and to see the direction 'arrows' to hit.\n\nI enjoy playing to songs I recognize which help me get immersed into the game and I do like the trainer overlay, but I would occasionally like to turn this off.\n\nThe biggest con for me like everyone else is the subscription price; $19 is a bit steep. I'd be happy to pay $1015 per month. Hopefully the price comes down a bit before the trial is over. I'd like to see this game succeed!\n\nOverall, I'd give the game a 3.5 due to the minor issues and cost but rounding up to a 5 since I think some others have rated this a bit unfairly.\n\nHelpful | 5", "NatasXApr 29 at 10:49 AM\nExcellent Workout App!!!\n\nI just finished my 3rd workout and I am really energized to continue. What I like the most is that this workout app actually feels like it has a soul. Between the new classes, beautiful scenery, and relevant music. It just feels like it is really being curated. Often the problem I have had with this kind of app is the constant repetition feels empty at a certain point. Which just kills my motivation.\n\nI mention the scenery because one thing I hate about gyms is staring at that same wall all the time. So far I haven't had the same scenes come up to often. It's really exciting to see where you are going next. I've even had a fictional sci-fi theme come up.\n\nOf course, I will reevaluate when the trial ends, but so far I see myself keep going with the subscription and see where this thing grows. Probably even going to buy a heart rate monitor to pair.\n\nMy only caution is based on the reviews I think some people were expecting more of a game than a workout app. This app is about working out first and foremost to help you achieve your fitness goals. If you're looking for a typical rhythm game this probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a workout. You've come to the right place.\n\nIf you have any doubts I do believe the tutorial is free without signing for an account or anything. That will definitely give you a good flavor for how the workouts in the app look and feel.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseApr 29 at 11:22 AM\n\nThanks so much for the kind words, glad it sounds like you're really enjoying your Supernatural fitness journey so far.

Very short songs, extremely long pauses between them (heart rate never gets to a sustained good target) and after third song, it locked up on the loading screen and required a restart.\n\nDuring the workout, instructor was obnoxious and could NOT shut up for more than 2 seconds. Do people like that?\n\nI'm disappointed that internet is required at all times and you can't seem to preload the songs for a lesson. At the very least the program should be caching the next song while your in the current song, not wait until after.\n\nI was set up to accept the idea of a $20/mo fee since I'm not paying a gym right now but not with this shameful execution.\n\nThe positive?

I think the devs should consider a one-time purchase option that comes with pre-loaded core exercises, and then include add-ons for additional cost. I think daily updates are impractical because of the associated price and the fact that I would not use this as a substitution workout, but as a supplement to my exercise regimen.

It's visually nice as well. I will continue to use the free month trial but will immediately cancel the ridiculous subscription of $20 month. Are you kidding me?... I get the same fun work out with BoxVR and Beat Saber. However if it was a flat rate like all the other games, I would definitely buy it for $29. I would even consider $40. Now I'm guessing the reason they are trying to game us for that rate is because of the unnecessary trainers they are paying to be a part of the program. WE DON'T NEED THEM! Leave them for one purpose, the tutorial or an introduction on how to move and hit the objects, etc. That's it! We don't need to hear them say the same thing over and over if I wanted to choose the same program because I really like the song being played. This is why you're making us pay every month? Keep the programs and lose the trainers. Take a page from BoxVR. They've done it right. I know you may want to be different from them but it really is already unique with and without the trainers. I love the fact that you can continue to play with out losing if you miss to many objects unlike in Beat Saber whereas I can focus on getting a workout. Also if you feel you MUST keep the trainers... make it optional for us to SKIP them or to use them at all. Some of us don't want or need the warm up. Let us skip it if we want. Add more workouts.

Overall, I'm extremely impressed ... and slightly addicted. The landscapes are beautiful, although a bit grainy (as to be expected for real life images in VR). The gameplay is excellent and the challenging mix of squats and every-which-way saber chops makes it so enjoyable that time flys by. Although some other folks have complained about the trainer guidance, I personally enjoy it, as it can serve as a much needed boost in motivation or a simple reminder to breath and pay attention to your posture. I do have a few suggestions:\n\n1) More and varied music: I feel like the creators tried too hard to incorporate commercial pop music at the expense of greater variety. I'd rather listen to generic or lesser known electronic tracks than hear the same song over and over again.\n2) Longer workouts: My ideal workout at this intensity would last around 40 minutes. Obviously you can do two back-to-back workouts, but then you have to sit through the intro and cool down sessions (and your HR drops)\n3) Better support for HR monitors: I have a Garmin watch that I tried to pair with the Android app with no luck. So I ended up purchasing the Polar HR monitor Supernatural sells on it's website. Still no luck. I contacted support and their response was \"well, you can track your HR on the Polar Android app.\" So $80 bucks down the drain!\n\nOverall, I'm still really enjoying the game and look forward to new content coming down the pipeline. Yes, $20 a month is a pretty penny, but if they add more music (and fast), I'll have no problem renewing that subscription!\n\nHelpful | 5", "rwmaxApr 28 at 4:51 PM\nA great fitness app\n\nProvides a great workout, much better than Beat Saber Expert+. The experience is really well tailored to get you a good workout and I find myself getting really pumped up playing this.\n\nI consider this a workout app first and game second which is why I understand some of the design decisions. For instance, I actually like the trainer, but hope their commentary is tailored specifically to your performance in the future.\n\nAt $19/month, you get really good maps and songs which may not be my favorites, but are very good for workout songs so I am pretty content with that.\nI really think the subscription model is justified if they keep a good variety of licensed music, as it really is important to have a good amount of variety to get me into the workout.\n\nCan be improved, but I definitely think it is in a very good state for a new release. Will likely be improved in the future to fuel subscriptions.\n\nHelpful | 5", "AaronMJones2Apr 28 at 1:36 PM\nThis might be worth the cost?\n\nThis was a lot of fun!!

Clean UI, stable framerate, good graphics for a quest game. The song selection could be worse, I guess. Connecting to a smart watch is a must for a fitness app, nice that functionality is there. Also a plus that there is a companion app.\n\nNow the cons.\nHit detection is not great. Anyone with beatsaber experience will tell you that. I know song preference is subjective, but...meh. only the apple watch is supported. I assume support for other watches will be added later, but currently that doesn't help the majority of smart watch or heart rate monitor users. The fact that it always has to be online is also a big no no. In the event your connection gets interrupted, you have lost all progress. I had to repeat the last song of my workout 3 times before it finally stopped saying there was a connection error.\n\nI know they claim the reason they need to ask 20 bucks a month is because of the trainers and licensed music, but let's be honest, the vast majority of users will want to turn the trainers off, which there currently is no option for. Trainers are meant to demonstrate and correct form, the latter of which they do not do since it is not live. No one wants to hear some random person talk about how much they like the song that is playing. Pre-recorded small talk is incredibly stupid. If the reason for a subscription is something that most people will want to turn off, your model won't work. And just for comparison, this costs more than Netflix, Amazon prime, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon music, Xbox game pass ultimate, an annual pass to universal studios, a membership to planet fitness, the list goes on and on. If they think this provides even remotely the same value or content of any of those, they are out of their minds. The value is just not there, and never will be. On top of that, the nature of the service means if and when they have to shut down...that's it, it's just gone. No way to continue using it. All that money spent, just to not have access to it anymore.\n\nNo thanks.\n\nUpdate: after using it for a few days I've run into several game breaking issues. While in the middle of a song, the connection issue overlay came up blocking the vast majority of the screen, while the track kept going, completely blocking my view of the blocks, until it decided to reconnect to the servers. This is completely unnecessary, and ruins the entire workout. There is also an issue with using passthrough, as twice when I stopped between songs to take a sip of water, while on the track review screen, it made me completely play the song over again. Until these issues are fixed, I wouldn't bother wasting your 30 day trial.\n\nHelpful | 12\nDeveloper ResponseApr 25 at 5:14 PM\n\nThanks for leaving such a detailed review.

This would be a much better product if it also included the ability to play individual songs separately with no (or optional) personal trainer commentary. If this feature alone is added, I would change this to a 4-star rating; and if the developer continues to refine and add more features, it could easily warrant 5 stars. The core experience (maps, songs, backgrounds) is solid, but the whole package is too limited and restrictive at this point. (I even like the personal trainers, and would still use them; but there are also times I just want to enjoy a single song/map with no commentary.)\n\nOne other, more minor issue: Follow-the-trail parts should have some sort of in-game feedback to convey if you're hitting the mark or not.

It's not as good of a workout as Thrill of the Fight but it's definitely better than beatsaber in that aspect.\n\nI do have some issues though:\n\nThe trainers are useless outside of the initial tutorial. They are practically DJ's that will randomly annoy you throughout the workouts. There is no option to turn off their audio, just an option to reduce their volume by 50%. I don't need them to introduce every song and I don't need their encouragement during the workout. I want to work out and enjoy the music, not hear their voice. It's so annoying that it's almost a deal breaker for me.\n\nThe music volume seems capped.. especially compared to beatsaber. I play with headphones and it sounds like the song is playing at half volume with everything maxed out. This is probably to prevent the music from drowning out of the voice of the trainer.. which brings us back to the first point. Please give us an option to get rid of them.\n\nI really do enjoy the full body workout I get from this game, but the low music volume and the trainers may keep me from renewing.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 1 at 11:33 AM\n\nThanks for your feedback.

I am not even doing the pro level workout. It says the workout adjusts based on how well I am doing which I am not sure about as I have only used it 3 times so far. One feature suggestion would be I would like to see the trainer in a side window doing the workout.\n\nCons\nLike everyone says 20 dollars is way too much. I would be ok if there are no new locations that need scanning just songs should be fine.\n\nThere is no family plan which means I will have to sign up and pay for 6 different accounts and login and log off every time to switch accounts which is not very practical or affordable.\n\nFor now if you are single and are the only user for your VR system and just use this app instead of a gym membership than it would make sense to pay 20 a month.\n\nHelpful | 3", "eastcoastchillMay 11 at 9:57 PM\nFun workout!\n\nGreat stay at home workout.

Especially that it is not paid review;)\n\nIf it was Beat Saber 2 I would pay 30 $ at one time and give 5/5.\n\nEverything here is prettier than in Beat Saber. But the creators are lying. There is nothing more here. Playability is the same. Cubes turned into rocks. Blocks in triangles. It's also 360 degrees here. Workouts are all talk during the song. Daily new workouts are equivalent to custom songs at Beat Saber. Only that licensed. The only advantage Supernatural is appearance. It's very nice. The setting is great.\n\nBut you can't call it Beat Saber 2 because they are other creators. I am surprised that the creators of Beat Saber do not react.\n\nThe game is 5/5 the same as Beat Saber, but 1/5 for copying all the mechanics.\n\nThese workouts are simply songs with added motivational commentary. A well-done map in the Beat Saber editor will give you the same. Only without saying a word.\n\nGive the opportunity to buy once for $ 30 I will buy. Unless Beat Saber sues you sooner. However, subscribing is not worth it.\n\nI would think about $ 5 a month. More is crazy. $ 20 is theft. The information that 20 $ is a promotional price is insane.\n\nTo sum up - the game is beautiful, but in mechanics it's Beat Saber. It is worth installing and playing for a free month.

That being said, I've never had so many issues with a game losing track of the controllers.\n\nI am constantly having the right bat lock into place and I'm unable to move it because the game lost track of it. It has only happened once with the black bat but it's every session with the right one. Yes, fresh batteries and a fully charged headset. That's not the issue. It's the only game I've ever had tracking issues with.\n\nThe other thing is the targets themselves. I see why they call it Supernatural because you have to be a mythical creature with four elbows to hit some of them. Some tracks are great while other are ridiculous. I've noticed since the last two patches tracking has gotten worse and I am getting standing targets way out of reach too low or too high. No, it's not during a lunge or when the portals change positions. I'm talking about targets dead on coming towards you and being out of reach.\n\nI ran through the calibration three times now and still have issues.

Currently the game is definitely more beautiful and 1/2 the songs are better, but the odd really overplayed (lady gaga!) is full on cringe, and the one time cost vs the $240/year cost is a tough sell at that.\nOther notes:\n1. It's difficult to determine if you're supposed to be rotating at waist to strike targets coming at angles or turning with your feet. That could be made clearer.\n2. With all the rotating and lunging, it would be good to put an audio orientation to keep you centered in your mat. If the music were coming from an invisible speaker at center you could easier find your way back to center before lunging into your sofa.\n3.

I like a lot of things about this--I like the encouragement from the coaches--but as I play it I feel it could be better. I love Beat Saber and loved the fitness song Fitbeat and hoped to have an experience a little bit more like that with Supernatural. I like the song lists but the choreography is, simply put, not fun. You never get that feeling like you are dancing or grooving. I also agree that there is a bit too much of a game-like challenge in some of the courses...I'd rather see choreography that is challenging because of the fitness element--not the hand-eye coordination element. For that I will play Beat Saber! Very promising, though, and I am playing it and sweating in it every day.\n\nOne other thing which is I think you could make better use of the coaches. The cool downs are way too short, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to have some stretches to start as well. You're paying the coaches; they should do more!\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nHelpful | 0", "cbowe89May 1 at 8:32 PM\nUpdated: Really loving it!\n\nEditing my original review: Now that the initial glitches seem to be fixed with an update, this game is a great workout! Im by no means in shape. Im a healthy weight due to a naturally good metabolism, but thats all. The first workout was intense and I will definitely be doing more. When you add in the lunges and the power strikes, this does so much more for a workout than games like beat saber.\n\nThe only reason that I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no option for profiles for other household members. The ability to have profiles for different household members would be important, so that their progress does affect your stats. I know Im not the only person that shares a headset with at least 1 other person.\n\nAlso, I received my free sweatproof liner for the headset today.

Am I supposed to focus on amazing squats and smashing power and stretching or is it a puzzle game now where I have to confusingly flail here and there without any sense? Who teaches that kind of workout? At least maintain a pattern for 15-20 seconds.\n\nSoon I get so frustrated I just quit and go to Beat Saber (which has easy, normal and higher levels. I play hard level in most songs but theyre easier than any Supernatural workout...and thats not a compliment). Maybe have workouts at different levels..some where you can actually focus on breathing and power and heart rate, and other where people who just want to flail their arms can do that.

I'm not a big fan of beastsaber in 360, so I really didn't enjoy the 360-degree rotation aspect of Supernatural. I prefer everything coming at me straight on. The monthly subscription price is not unreasonable if you plan to submerge yourself in this program. Having said that, I think this app would be much more successful if they charged $0.99, or a $1.99 per lesson. People could purchase what they want and keep it forever. I think they would probably make more money and keep people interested in the app if they could purchase individual workout sessions rather than having to pay a very high monthly subscription. $20 per month is what most people will pay for a game. For me, I lost interest 10 minutes in, and then played pistol whip and beat saber for an hour and a half. I felt like I got a better workout with those two programs because I typically play most songs in expert mode and I stay away from from the 360-degree songs because I don't like them. I think this is a really good product, it's just not for me. I wish the developer lots of luck!\n\nHelpful | 3", "CosmicClusterMay 10 at 11:38 AM\nGood Idea, Poor Execution\n\nFirst of all, you have to subscribe to this. As in nearly $20/month (as of May2020) which is more than buying a music pack for Beat Saber. Still, I liked the idea of mixing Beat Saber with a lower body workout. To start, the graphic locations were awesome.\n\nUnfortunately, this app had a huge bug. The squat/lunge triangles kept getting smaller. Like, hurt myself smaller, requiring me to recalibrate constantly. Recallibration is a 2-3 minute tutorial you go through in the beginning of the game. So going through this EVERY time is obnoxious for something that takes 10 seconds (stand and hold buttons, right lunge and hold button, left side repeat, squat and hold buttons).\n\nI finally threw in the towel and quit the app when the triangles were shrinking in the middle of workouts. I contacted support when it was happening between back-to-back workouts about two weeks ago, but they had no advice and insisted someone else was using it (news flash, what did you not get when I said back-to-back workouts, as in no one touched the Oculus I still had on my head and I didn't get better at squats\\lunges in 20 mins). Missing them comes with a hefty score penalty because they're worth more than hitting targets. For $19/month, it is not worth it.\n\nAlso nitpicking, their claim of having a vast mix of songs is a lie. In my time with the app, most of the workouts shared 6 songs. They were ok, but not my jams. Perhaps they'll add more later. The gameplay in Beat Saber is WAY better. The arrow sequence makes sense (typically have an up to a down, rarely have close up up, etc.) and I can change their colors to make it easier for me to differentiate left from right. Supernatural has neither of these. You may be hitting two ups in quick succession and the targets are black and white. I am an expert Beat Saber player, but on Supernatural I miss way more than I should...\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseMay 10 at 5:54 PM\n\nHey there - Thanks for the note. It sounds like there might be some confusion with what you're seeing as a bug. The small triangles indicate a low squat and hold position. The different shapes of triangles in Supernatural indicate a specific workout movement for you to perform (eg a squat, lunge, step-through, etc.) We'll be adding a tips and tricks section to our FAQ that should be ver helpful for our new members. Regarding the calibration and training, you'll also only have to go through that once during the Supernatural setup. You have the option to redo it via the Settings menu in case you want to re-calibrate but that is totally optional and not required for each workout. Thanks for the feedback regarding the music. We have a much larger library than 6 songs with a lot more on the way that we think you'll really enjoy regardless of your musical preferences.

Problem is, I think the execution doesn't really add up. The biggest issue I found its that there is no flow. It's hard too to compare to Beat Saber. In Beat Saber you can get into a fun flow and feel the music in your movements. In Supernatural though everything feels erratic and random. Also, the backgrounds are pretty locations but they quickly become uninteresting once you're focused on the workout and the background isn't dynamic. I do like the music overall and the coaches encouragement is good. I hope they are able to update it and fix the for issues. I think the price needs to be closer to $10 also.

While it has beautiful graphics and gets my heart rate up, it isnt working well enough for me in its current form. My main complaint is that this app does not reliably induce a flow state  unlike, say, Beat Saber, SynthRiders, or Pistol Whip. I LOVE the idea of an app that dynamically adjusts difficulty to keep me at the edge of my comfort zone. However, the dynamic adjustment of Supernatural does not work very well for me; it spends way too much time in the so difficult its frustrating zone. The maps seem overly complex for the kind of workout its guiding me through.\n\nI would much rather if the difficulty/complexity started out very low and slowly ramped up  something I can easily achieve in Beat Saber by manually choosing difficulty level and modifiers. If Supernatural allowed manual adjustment of difficulty and tweaking with modifers in the way Beat Saber does, it would probably be much more appealing to me.\n\nI also wish I could turn off the voiceover of the fitness instructors. Sometimes I enjoy hearing their instructions, and other times I would like to just concentrate on the workout as guided by the structure of the game itself. However you can only reduce the volume of the voiceover to 50%.\n\nIts possible that Supernatural will evolve into an app I would find appealing and worth $19/month (or that someone else will create a fitness app that actually delivers on what this promises. As it is I would spend maybe $5/month on it at most.\n\nAll that said, I would encourage anyone to give this a try for the free month and decide if its worth it for you. The concept behind it is great, the visuals are gorgeous, and it will give you an intense workout. The execution doesnt work well for me, but your mileage may vary.\n\nHelpful | 2", "VallynneApr 29 at 7:21 AM\nThe potential is there, solid start\n\nThis is a preliminary review of the actual experience in-game and not results. I'm taking advantage of the 30-day trial to see where I end up physically.\n\nI'm approaching Supernatural as a fitness subscription and not as a \"game\" because IMO that's its foundation. So, thinking of VR Peloton. I actually appreciate the trainers chiming in during the workouts, because I need the encouragement. But I do wish it were of a slightly different flavor/tone - they sound like the upbeat, pushy trainers in the Peloton commercials, which seems to be a style thing, and my dream coach during these workouts would be saying things like \"I know you're thinkin' about that ice cream, and maybe you can have some later, but right now I want you to push this and smash the crap out of those orbs.\" Being able to turn trainers off entirely for the session kind of defeats the purpose of the new workouts released daily, as these trainers are actually doing the same map during the recordings (pretty sure that's correct), but for the replay factor a time would probably come when you didn't want the verbal encouragement.\n\nThe music: this is apparently a selling point here, but not for me. I recognize one of the songs (so far), would agree that one or two of those I was not familiar with are decent to work out to, but as for the rest...not my preference. And these songs come around quite a bit between workouts. I'd prefer generic rhythm/epic music with no lyrics over what I'm listening to. I am admittedly a dinosaur, and know you can't please everyone.\n\nGameplay: the flow is pretty intuitive, and the difficulty is supposedly dynamic on some workouts - meaning that if you're sucking, the workout adjusts itself to your suckage. I find them challenging, almost too challenging, but I'm able to push through. Accuracy re: hitting orbs seems fluky and my accuracy in Beat Saber leads me to believe it's not simply me sucking.\n\nFor now, continuing with daily use to assess results!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 29 at 11:13 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for giving us a shot.

It's like Beat Saber, where when you really get swinging you sweat a lot. Unlike BS, it just doesn't seem to do it right.\n\nWhat I like:\n- The coaching is great! I love the fact they'r in your ear encouraging, and reminding you to breath, and strike harder (I doubt it has any real correlation though)\n- The music is not my style, but is appropriate for the atmosphere and does what it needs to. Truthfully better than a lot of the generic EDM in BS.\n- The visuals are great. Love the backgrounds, they make it feel open and big.\n- It really does make you sweat and get a great cardio workout. I think I might try some wrist weights soon.\n- Option to demo it to another person. Great idea, especially when it's (sort of) customized to you.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- Like one of the other reviewers said. The mapping is pretty bad. They're all over the place. Some spheres are tuned ok to the song, but then you have some that are almost impossible to hit coming from the previous ones.\n- There is either a lot of processing lag, or something is off with the timing. Again like the other reviewer, a lot of my swings aren't connecting even though I know I'm on it. You can even see it during gameplay. My arm swings, and the bat lags behind. That's a dealbreaker to me.\n- I would like to see some customization. I'd like to be able to change the sphere colors to something that my brain is more accustomed to swinging at (Red & Blue)\n- I wish there was a difficulty level option. Maybe I'm missing it, but all I've seen is Varying Difficulty. That does not help me for my current mood.\n- The price is way too high. I understand there's a lot of work in the background, and you're paying trainers and licensing for music. But $19 p/m is more than my gym membership. That's just plain crazy!\n\nAt this point with these issues (especially mapping and tracking), I don't think I'll be continuing after the 30 days.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 30 at 10:19 AM\n\nThanks for the feedback. Glad to hear you're loving the Supernatural coaches and the landscapes, much appreciated! It sounds like you might be experiencing some calibration issues.

If you're still experiencing that issue, please send a note out to us at support@getsupernatural.com so we can get that right for you. Thanks for the additional points on further customization and difficulty settings, it's something that we'll definitely look further into as we hear more from our community.

So based on the developer's response, I decided to give Supernatural another go at it so reactivated my account. I did 3 workouts and I lost my connection to the white bat only once but quickly corrected itself. I do still have issues with balloons not reacting when I hit so not sure if it is calibration thing or still same old glitch problem. I will continue to monitor to see how it goes and hopefully up the stars because I really do enjoy the workout part of it so have high hopes. It's the competitive part of the app (ie accuracy and power) that has me on pause. Stay tuned!\n\n\nI was absolutely loving this app! The workout was amazing and Used it everyday but After a while I just could not handle the glitches anymore. As my friend list grew I got more and more competitive and losing points because my white bat decides to float out of no where, black bat momentarily disappears or suddenly swiping the balloons but they wouldnt pop made me so mad that I started to cry and just canceled and deactivated my account even though I had it for free til May 25th. If you dont care about scoring this app is wonderful. If you have a competitive nature and want the best power and accuracy scores you can get, this game will truly frustrate you!\n\nHelpful | 0", "WubWuvApr 26 at 9:33 AM\nA great experience with exercise in VR\n\nBeing stuck inside and needing to exercise is hard if you don't have any experience/motivation. Hence I like guided workouts, but reading articles and watching Youtube videos weren't doing it for me. So I looked into getting a Quest to explore the immersive VR exercise space.\n\nSupernatural VR: The initial experience was pretty fun in terms of premise, the trainers, and the gameplay (didn't know it was 360). Having a trainer there gave me a bit of comfort, and I actually did like the supportive talk through the session. Does it help you exercise and burn a ton in cardio? Yes! I actually look forward to the sessions each day now! I have only been using the product for 4 days, but I may continue using it past the 30 day trial if they keep up with content.\n\nWhat I really liked:\n-The 360 gameplay\n-Environment and music choice\n-Trainers in terms of education, support, and warmup/cooldowns\n\nWhat I didnt:\n-Sometimes the gameplay doesnt register hits and maybe too hard for beginners-- if I had no experience in rhythm games I would probably fail all the time. There should be a category for beginners and pro.\n-Worried about lack of content, I played 3 sessions and had two of the same songs in two of those sessions. Also one of the sessions was missing the trainer, but that was due to the lockdown.\n-Promotion of the apple watch for heart rate over cheaper alternatives (found cheaper android alternatives)\n-Monthly Subscription Cost\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nYou want to exercise and perhaps have a small escape from reality, give Supernatural VR a try! If they consistently add more songs, trainer dialogue, and features long term I think that this could be a great daily app for those that want to exercise but are stuck inside.\n\nHelpful | 0", "kingcodeApr 25 at 7:43 AM\nToo expensive, subscription required\n\nMaybe I'm not the target demographic but a monthly fee that costs as much as most games do outright is too much. I couldn't even go past the initial screens without giving them a credit card.\n\nI think this game would do better with a stand alone price and optionally pay for DLC packs. $20 for each new monthly released pack would let them obtain users who want new content while not restricting the game to them.\n\nHelpful | 8\nDeveloper ResponseApr 25 at 7:49 AM\n\nThanks for writing to us.

You do need a fair amount of space though, I'd like to see an option that doesn't require me to spin around 360 degrees and worry I'm going to drift into a wall (very much hits the limit of my small NYC apartment)\n\nThat said I won't be renewing after the trial because the trainers make me want to rip the headset off. I very much want to see an option where you can pick a workout but have them never appear or hear their audio. I don't want someone yelling at me about how this is their favorite song over and over again. Honestly the feedback is limited to encouragement because they can't actually see you and help you with form, etc. I'm not a huge fan of the music either but that's personal and I'm not a top 40 radio type of guy. Nothing personal against the trainers, they seem like nice people. but I'm an introvert and you are way too much in my personal space.\n\nIn a perfect world I would love to see a version that removes the licensed songs and the trainers (I assume this is their biggest running expenses) for a lower monthly price. The sweet spot using this app for me has been to shut off the audio completely and use my bluetooth headphones to exercise to my own music. But I already do that with BoxVR and that doesn't have a monthly fee.\n\nHelpful | 0", "METALfamilyMay 14 at 10:02 PM\nInteresting concept, fundamental issues\n\nThe idea of combining rhythmic slashing, squatting, and 360 motion to music sounds wonderful. Add beautiful backgrounds, heart monitoring tracking (app and monitor required), and coaching should make this an unbeatable concept.... However....\n\n1. The content right now is lacking - one workout added per day. With a monthly/yearly subscription, the price is steep\n2. The music taste for the workout is not for everyone. Each workout has a theme with the music - so, if you do not like the music, you will not like the workout. (Suggestion, same workout but customize genre of music).\n3. The tracking is off. How the game registers hits are off at times, especially the corners (upper right for example). Like others, hard to tell how well targets are hit. I think the diagonal direction targets are slightly misaligned\n4. The backgrounds are really static. Some animation to the water, but it quickly becomes cartoonish and some locations the color is over saturated or blurry.\n5. The targets pattern are not combined very well. There are times when I turn sideways all I see are black/white targets all over. Easy to get out of rhythm- do instead of deliberate motions, it becomes haphazard.\n6. No way to practice the routine. For one, I would not mind being able to slow it down to get a better idea what the pattern is. That way, when trying again - I could concentrate on the moves. Hard levels would frustrate beginners very easily.\n7. The moves are very repetitive- slashing and squatting. Fun for a bit, but then gets boring quickly. Maybe more content or hire practiced map/pattern builders. Not sure how the dynamic detection works at all.\n8. Glitchy - times when portals show up (meaning targets should come out), but nothing appears\n9. Easy to get used to the same motions - so the level of working out diminishes over time\n10. The pauses between songs are too long, would suggest option of continuous play\n11. Some locations have backgrounds that make the white targets hard to see at times.\n\nI imagine this exercise would be fun a few times a week, but then put aside after pattern fatigue.\n\nHelpful | 0", "crusenApr 25 at 8:54 AM\nA solid workout, but value is unknown...\n\nI've been working out in Ring Fit and Beat Saber the last few months and seen really good results but after a couple days of this I'm more sore than I've been from either of those. That being said there are some issues. For one, tracking is not as good as Beat Saber. I play that on Expert/Expert+ but I'm missing notes here I know I shouldn't be. I've also had some issues with crashing.\n\nThat being said the real question long-term is value. As someone who canceled a $20/month gym membership that wasn't being used when I started doing my gaming workouts I'm not opposed to spending the money if the workouts are worlds better than others, but we'll see about that over the next few weeks. I'm enjoying it even as it destroys me so far. Hoping updates will fix tracking and stability and that workouts stay varied fun.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Rogue_m82May 22 at 7:52 PM\nThese devs are crazy.\n\nContent is nice, app is a buggy mess not even as good as BeatSaber was in early-release. App is a front for getting the cash flowing in and finishing the content and fixing the bugs later. Peloton fitness is $6 a month less and has live instructors. Local gyms for $20 offer free tanning, child care while you work out, classes, and interaction with a real person on how you are doing and how to improve. This app isn't full body tracking, it's just hands and head. There's no cameras to see your form. You might be getting a workout simply by doing it so fricken wrong it's work. The instructors/coaches constantly pep talk and never really shut up. Would be fine if it were targeting my actions with a response to do better at what I'm doing but it's not, it's an attaboy. Canned.\n\nThe app itself isn't bad, it's good. But the issue is the pricing. $20 a month is top of the fitness food chain for pricing without actually working with a personal trainer. App good, but business team needs to seek more investment capital and not try cash grabbing like this from a population forced to stay at home.\n\nHelpful | 16\nDeveloper ResponseApr 25 at 1:10 PM\n\nHi, thanks for all of the feedback, and thanks for the compliment as well.

Its expensive but worth it. Signing up for sure!\n\nHelpful | 16", "VentelusApr 28 at 6:00 PM\nSupernatural Has Potential But...\n\nPros\n\n1. It gives a more intense workout than Beat Saber and Pistol Whip combined in half the time, especially on Pro. You will sweat and feel the burn better than any other VR fitness app. That part is 100% true.\n\n2. The environments are gorgeous, and seeing all these places exist is amazing.\n\n3. Pre-licensed pop songs with official beat maps are a godsend. The lack of them was why Beat Saber was modded so early in its life.\n\n4. The triangle concept for squats and lunges is cool and I like it a lot more than the walls in Beat Saber or Pistol Whip.\n\n5. Apparantly, it has really good smartwatch support for watches it supports, though I can't personally attest to that because mine's not supported.\n\nCons\n\n1. The cost is unnecessary. At $25 a month my local gym gives me full access to all equipment, free form consultation, 24/7 building access, free tanning (that I don't use), and I can bring one friend free every visit. Beat Saber with every map pack costs less than what it costs to subscribe to this for just 5 months (84 vs 95 at time of writing). And apparantly thats a \"founding members\" rate? The pricing is so exorbitent and I can't understand why.\n\n2. The Personal Trainer idea is cool in concept but terrible in practice. A personal trainer is for genuine form consultation, tips, critiques, examples, etc. Not some prerecorded motivation that can't even be turned off. The voiceovers distract from the song and, ironically, hinder the ability to truly get involved in the workout.\n\n3. Tracking is bad. Not terrible, but not good. Hitting even remotely off center of the balls is a toss up on whether it will register or not and the lack of haptic feedback on non-power hits leaves you constantly questioning if you hit or not. I lend part of this to the fact that, for some reason, the bat is not aligned with your hand like most sword or club type objects are. They are tilted a fair bit forward and I don't understand why.\n\n4. The triangles and tails can sometimes counterintuitively get in the way of proper form. This was most noticeable on back to back lunges where it would be almost impossible to fully extend into one lunge before having to go the other way, resulting in a movement more akin to bouncing.\n\n5. The environments, while beautiful, basically amount to a 3D rendered photograph with some added water and rock physics. They get old after the initial awe.\n\nOverall, this product has potential. If the tracking was improved and the cost was lowered to 9.99/m or even 12.99/m then it could be a 4 star product. Add in some quality of life improvements like aligning the bat to your hand, better haptics, and being able to turn off the coach and you'd have an exceptional product. But, in its current state, I simply cannot recommend this to someone at its full price, the quality for the cost just isn't there.\n\nHelpful | 1", "MonsterTangMay 13 at 10:05 PM\nFun but not worth the monthly $$$\n\n1. Should have a option of turning off the instructions from the coach.\n2. I have been using this for about two weeks. Enjoyed the music at first but very soon realized not much music choices.\n3. Please add more background pictures too. They are very beautiful but very limited.\n\nNot sure whether I am gonna sign up after 30 days free trial. I feel reasonable if it sells for $29.99.

The cost of a gym membership is about the same or less than this, which makes its value diminished.\n\n-1/2 star: No way to turn off 360 movement. While this may not be an issue for some, my space is limited so whenever it would have me turn and lunge I was constantly worried I would hit something that took me out of the experience.\nAdmittedly the 360 does provide a bit better workout it would be nice if it had a front facing only option for those limited in space.\n\n-1/2 star: Trails (follow the colored trail with your arm) originally I thought they were neat but they ruined them by making notes of the same color randomly in the middle of the trail you are supposed to follow completely defeating the purpose of the trail.\n\n-1/2 star: Some of the more intense workouts feel more like beat Saber on expert or expert+ while some may like that, I personally have beat Saber so don't want to be trying to do complicated patterns in this that just add to frustration and not the workout, hard should be hard because of the movement and being physically challenging not because of complicated timing of the things you hit.\n\nNuetral: Tracking is decent but not as good as in beat saber, at times it didn't notice some of the faster movements but for the most part it is acceptable.\n\nThe Good:\nYou will sweat your butt off, and if you are looking to shed some weight..if you keep at this and eat healthy this will definitely do the trick. I Personally love lounging back and fourth for whatever reason and as long as your not concerned with with getting a perfect score like beat saber and just enjoy the work you will really enjoy the encouragement from the trainers and the music.\n\nIt has adaptive difficulties and set difficulties, the adaptive ones might feel off for you at first but should match up better the more data it has.\n\nHelpful | 1", "ChildOf7SinsJun 3 at 10:27 AM\nThe starting was fine...\n\nBut make sure you have 30 yrs of beat saber experience if you want to take on more than a light workout.

Beautiful Graphics - Check; 2. Heart Rate Monitor integration - Check; 3. Fresh daily content and trainers - Check. But it is just not satisfying and is missing something to justify my $19 a month: A. The hits do not feel right or satisfying, unlike BeatSaber or BoxVR, you feel completely disconnected (even something as simple as if you hit the bats together there is no haptic feedback); B. The choice of Black and White targets is a complete fail, half the time they blend with the background (especially when you get some fog on the glasses); C. The targets come too close and too fast (even at beginner)  I play Beatsaber well on expert regularly but I just find this frustrating (especially the random and overused switches between left and right (black and white) bats/targets or the trails with absolutely no haptic feedback); D. I did not see any calorie estimator  with the heart rate was hoping this would be present; and E. Did I mention it is $19 a month (discounted).\n\nAgain, I want to love this as it has all the right boxes checked but you would be better off (and have more fun) playing Beatsaber for 20 minutes and then 30+minutes of Box VR.

I am pretty fit  workout 5+ a week, cardio, wrestle, dance, etc  and it gets me sweaty and my heart rate going. I play Beat Saber regularly, expert only and get almost all As and Ss and still find myself challenged a bit here and there on this app (though that may be due to hit detection issues).\nThe dynamic difficulty seems to be working. I started at triple plat and now get single and double plat. Feels about right.\nThe hit detection needs work. The bats are visually presented longer than it seems the hit detection reads them to be. Plus, Im pretty sure Im hitting targets but not getting consistent vibration feedback  perhaps because Im not swinging hard enough? Either way, the combination of these two issues makes me constantly questioning that rather than focusing on movement, form, breathing, or routine. This, imo, should not be the case for app like this. Even if you need to make the hit detection more technically lenient, I would do so. It feels off and distracting.\nThe music needs way more diversity. Whats here is great, but whats not here disappoints.\nI dont mind paying for a monthly sub  Ive paid thousands to MMOs over the years  but this price is way too high.

I have Google Fit that works flawlessly with other heart monitor apps. I am either struggling to get it recognized by the software, it does not keep track at all when recognized, or does not take readings correctly. It is to the point that I no longer use that feature within SuperNatural, rather I use Google Fit to do so. The headache & time wasted trying to get it to work was not worth dealing with.\n2) Many times when I start the software, it does not place me correctly within the designated area. The platform will appear several feet under my floor, or the placement for the room is not correct. Several times, I have to exit the software, reset the display without any adjustment & then start again & most times it will be correct.\n3) Today I started a work out, no targets, no squats, just music and the lead talking. This occurred after I had already had to restart to reset the view. The frustration from all of that has driven the energy needed to write this lengthy review. This is not how I want to increase my heart rate.\nI see a lot of features lacking as well, I am sure you have plans for later releases that will include some of those.\nAfter reading several reviews, I have to agree that your business model may be in question, and it leaves you vulnerable to competition.

It does share similarities and mechanics, especially with Beat Saber's 360* mode but the feel and focus are very different and this does give a higher intensity workout.\n\nI really like exercising and working out in VR but, I'm just not feeling this is a great fit for me. You do really get your body moving and your heart pumping but, there's too many issues for me to consider using this beyond the one month trial.\n\nFirst, I understand there are people who love feeling like they have a personal trainer and those who love guided workouts but... I don't. I hate hearing them talk throughout my workout. I just want to hear the music and go through the workout.\n\nSecondly, my space to use VR in is small. 360* workouts with swinging controllers run a high risk of smacking into nearby furniture. In Beat Saber I can chose not to do the 360* levels. In supernatural that's not an option. I would love if there was an option to not do 360*.\n\nThird, I'm not a fan of most of the music used. I would probably like it better if I could assemble workouts to the songs I like. I also see a \"genre\" tab that you can't select so it seems like I should be able to pick certain types of music but its not yet available unfortunately.\n\nFourth, this is often just painful to me. The app supposedly calibrates to your maximums which probably we a little deeper than I can actually achieve in the game. I have a bad back and not so great knees. This has contributed to me becoming overweight which is a big reason Im looking a fitness apps like supernatural but at the same time with my injuries I cannot get into the triangles quickly defintely cant pop up super fast like expected in the game and trying to do so os actually really painful. The only way to do it is to actually not us good and safe body mechanics and alignment which would also run the risk of further injury and pain anyways.\nThere should be more options to select for disability or and least be able to select only slower songs or fewer lunges/squats or something. Increase the lunge triangle height maybe so that those of us who cant physically move our bodies quickly into deep movements and back out have a larger target area to get in as an option thats better suited to certain injuries.\nMy final issue is that I dont think the tracking is the best. Maybe it has delays or something but I seem to miss a lot of the targets where I see my bat going right through them and not counting as a hit. I maintain about a 80-90% accuracy rate and in beat saber I can pass almost every level with an SS quality on expert. Im not a perfect hit and Im not expecting to get 100% but the ones where I clearly hit the target but it doesnt recognize it are very frustrating. Theres plenty I just plain missed and I accept that but there is also something odd going on with some hits.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Quantum-mechanicMay 13 at 9:38 AM\nIt's cool, but doesn't really deliver\n\nAfter trying out Supernatural for a few weeks, I have to say that I love the concept, but that I do not find that the application delivers on everything.\n\nOn their website, they feature six selling points: full body workouts, expert coaching, travel the world (cool locations), the best music, intelligent & personalized, and tracking progress. I find that they deliver on about half of these.\n\nThe locations and music are phenomenal, the fact that they are pushing out daily workouts is awesome, and their app does track your workouts.\n\nBut when it comes to the actual workout (or gameplay) Supernatural leaves a bit to be desired. One of the selling features is that \"workouts dynamically calibrate and respond to your body and effort\". After trying it out for a few weeks, I found that the application doesn't feel like it calibrates or responds to my body or my effort. In my experience, the dynamic workouts will ramp up to a difficulty level that is too high for me, and it doesn't ramp down when I start missing a lot of the targets. I personally find this very frustrating and that it gets in the way of me focusing on doing my best and having a good workout. This means that whenever a daily workout comes out and it uses the dynamic difficulty, I know that I am not in for a good time.\n\nThe trainers also do not feel super personalized. It feels like a pre-recorded track that doesn't actually respond to anything you are doing. The trainers are more similar to a video/TV workout and less similar to a trainer that you would see in a class setting.\n\nSince the application/workouts do not feel like they respond to me, that the trainers feel like they are just pre-recorded and non-responsive, and that these things get in the way of a good workout, I don't see how I am able to justify the cost of the application. Had I felt they delivered on everything, I would have readily signed up for the annual membership for that $13/month price.\n\nHelpful | 2", "CloudTurtle27Apr 23 at 4:49 PM\nInteresting concept poorly executed\n\nInteresting concept but falls short in execution. This game is basically beat saber with a personal trainer motivating you in the backround. The trainer is a nice touch not to mention the breath taking landscapes, but the game still falls behind on the most important element, gameplay. The gameplay itself is unoriginal, uninspiring and isnt challenging. When I strike a target there should be tactile feedback and a impactful noise to acompany it. Unfortunately all the music games (except for Audica) suffer from this. The subscription model is ridiculous considering you can buy a better game with all DLC content for a fraction of the price.

I am very much into fitness games and have been playing a combo of Box VR, BeatSaber and Thrill of the Fight. I believe in fitness games for VR and have been seeing the benefits of them!!\nI will give this game several more attempts, but on the first couple tries heres what I experienced:\n\nCONS:\n- I feel it is very strange in regards to the mechanics and hitting the orbs. Kept missing them and not a fan of them coming from all different ways. With fitness games, Im not so interested in the challenge of high scores, like beat saber. Im interested in getting a good focused work out that is fun, engaging and heart pumping.\n- im not a fan of the coaches talking (and breathing hard??) throughout the exercises.\n- some of the squats required you to hit orbs while squatting. This just felt awkward (and again, takes away from the focus of doing it right)\n\nPROS:\n- The graphics were beautiful and amazing. I wish box VR had environments like this.\n- integration with Apple Watch\n- I like the triangle version of squatting (vs a bar that just comes at you)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\n- The bats and targets just seem awkward to hit. I almost wish they could just blend the awesome environments and graphics with box VRs style of (shadow boxing) work out. I plan to keep playing the trial and update my review accordingly. \n** when it comes to the $20 subscription that everybody is (understandably) up in arms about  I would seriously consider investing in it if I felt the workout and gameplay was worth it.

Our dynamic difficulty feature adjusts workouts in real-time to suit the intensity that's best for you. We have a Beginner's Only and Pros Only workout in the library that will show you the breadth of difficulty levels locked between two workouts. Here's another pro tip: our workouts are choreographed specifically to reward following through on the targets themselves, and encourage dance like movements that activate your full body. We agree that working out is not about achieving a high score, but all about getting your body flowing in a way that feels right for you.

Can you allow a moment to enjoy the environments? There is no time to look around you before, during, or after the workout. Maybe the user can click to start the workout once inside the environment. The environment is a big draw for me but I dont get enough time with it. 2. Can you place in modifiers for injuries? I have knee and back injuries and the songs are all lunges and squats. So its painful and I know eventually I wont show up and turn off my subscription if I associate the workout with pain. I would like to reduce or turn off the level of squats and lunges and work my way up. I also think theres no way an average beginner could hit the volume and velocity of objects. Maybe this can be modified too and people can work their way up levels. 3. Can we have an option to turn off the trainer during song? I was sweating, but in pain, and its short of being fun.

Here are the issues:\n\nThere appears to be only 1 beginner level of difficulty which is clearly titled as such. However, all other trainings have no level of difficulty so I have to guess and so far have been overwhelmed by the difficulty level. Ii am sure I will improve to handle these levels - however, most other similarly styled exercise games have a level of difficulty. The user should not have to identify them by trial and error as that wastes time.\n\nNext, there is no clear exit game option.\n\nNext, I have a pretty mainstream heart rate tracker/smart watch (Fitbit versa) that does not have problems pairing via Bluetooth. Unfortunately I cannot pair with it in the Supernatural app. The ability to have the app paired to my HR tracking was a big motivator for me to consider the monthly cost of this. Since I cannot have my training adjust to my HR, I am not sure I will continue after the trial which is a darn shame as I did like this title. While training in Supernatural, my HR tracker has reached the peak zone very easily. So being able to pair to the app would really help my training.\n\nNext, if you need to calibrate, you have to hear the entire introduction part again which is a pain! There should be a condensed version of the calibration.\n\nFinally I feel 20$ a month is really high to charge on a monthly basis. Considering the above HR tracking issue, I am not sure if it is worth keeping.\n\nRight now, I will keep exploring the title as it is very pretty and is effective enough. I hope development worked to correct the HR tracker issue, along with the other issues and perhaps I will keep my membership!\n\nMay 8 update:\nSupernatural update actually added a couple classes, 1 being a clearly labeled lower level class, and 1 clearly labeled high level class. I was pleased to see this. More beginner classes would also be great in the future.\n\nStill, I am not able to connect my Fitbit versa to the supernatural Android app - it just will not detect it when the Fitbit is in discovery mode. I really wish this issue were addressed.\n\nI will keep playing with my trial and add to this if any new issues or improvements are made!\n\nThanks!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 8 at 5:12 PM\n\nHey there - glad you're enjoying the enhancements to the difficulty settings.

I'm not the only one who thought this was another Beat Saber ripoff, but as a rhythm game fan I felt compelled by curiosity to try it anyways. Now that I've completed the first \"pros only\" workout, I'm confident I can make a fair review.\n\nSupernatural is not a ripoff. This game has genuine production quality. The UI is sleek and effective, the photoscanned environments look great, and I appreciate the daily content additions. This game is trying hard to be it's own thing, but the saber-slash-notes VR rhythm genre is narrow and is already satisfied by Beat Saber.\n\nUnfortunately, the core gameplay of slashing notes simply isn't as good as Beat Saber. The notes are frustratingly difficult to hit and the levels don't flow well. The black and white notes blend into the background environment (this was really bad during the arctic level in the pros only workout). And sometimes noted are tucked behind the opaque triangles, so you don't see them until they fly past your head.\n\nThis game's fitness spin isn't enough to draw me away from Beat Saber, which is a more satisfying rhythm experience in every way. Plus Beat Saber is just as much of a workout as Supernatural (or more so, because its levels are faster and more complex), and with free mods you can track your workout all the same.\n\nAnd then there's the pricing. $20 a month is nuts. That's $240 a year! Even if this game was equally good as Beat Saber, I still wouldn't buy Supernatural. Not only is Beat Saber far cheaper in the not-so-long-run, it has an active modding community that pumps out tons of quality content for free.\n\nI do not recommend Supernatural in its current state. It does not offer enough original content to justify its crazy high price.

I haven't ever paid for a gym because I believe they are too expensive, even with all the benefits of once a month haircut, massage, actual expensive machines and weights, and others things that they offer for that price, imagine me paying for a game, that yes, its fun, and its aware of enhancing the body with each movement, but I am not willing to pay for that amount, a month.\n\nI mean, in real live, the developers have to pay the assistant once to do one session, record it, and create the game sessions with the songs, and -thousands- of people will benefit from that one session. Why not have a lower monthly fee? How about the purchase of in game packages of 5 songs or so, instead of a monthly fee? I would pay $10 for 5 or 10 songs feeling its fair, and when I get bored of the same songs, knowing the game has actually helped, I would highly probable buy another package. This gives me the feeling of ownership, that I know if I don't buy the next package, I can still use the application.\n\nHarsh truth, this game motivated me to buy beat saber instead (which I ignored for a long time), still, I am actually hoping for a change in pricing of this game so I can buy.\n\nIn my opinion, its a great game, 5 stars no doubt, but the pricing is 1 star.\n\nHelpful | 2", "budderz67976May 2 at 8:00 AM\nNot enough content for the money $$$\n\nNot only are there not enough workouts for anyone to be happy with, but it seems like all the current workouts are designed for VR experts who are already in great shape.

In fact I would say this is the most intense workout app yet on Quest. The trainer talking can provide some motivation and help keep you on track. Seeing your heart rate pattern throughout the workout from your Apple Watch after your done is cool.\n\nScenery is great and I do enjoy that. Music is top 40 hits during your workout.\n\nOkay now for the bad:\n\nThis is the worst rated app on Quest for a reason. If you signed up day one youll notice there are hardly any workouts. This is because they are developed daily for some reason and constantly updated. Cool concept but poorly thought out. What this creates is little content up front and potentially too much content down the road. Once you have 100 workouts in your library using the same game mechanics why do I need more?\n\nThe Apple Watch integration is cool, but the app is constantly opening when it shouldnt and is battery draining in a noticeable way. This is upsetting because its one of my favourite features of the app.\n\nThe game mechanics are basically Beat Sabre in 360 mode. The beginner workout is great, but once it starts to pickup the pace it becomes very hard to keep up, if you dont enjoy BS on expert mode you probably wont enjoy this either. Also 360 can cause motion sickness. One of the things I like about BoxVR is I never have to worry about which hand to punch a target with, a workout app shouldnt involve gaming skills IMHO.\n\nWorkout lengths are short so far, so if you are used to an app like BoxVR where you can pick your own length of workout you will be disappointed again, but that may change in the future as more workouts are added.\n\nThe music is top 40, so if you enjoy that then great. But unlike every other exercise app on Quest you cannot select your own songs to workout to.\n\nThe live trainers as a concept falls flat because I cant see the person working out to see their forum or technique to ensure I am doing an exercise properly. Not really a live trainer as much as a voice actor talking throughout the workout.\n\nOverall I would probably buy this for the scenery and workout intensity to add variety to my Quest workout routine, but at $240 a year I cant justify making this my primary workout app with all the glaring flaws.\n\nHelpful | 4", "mikeymalibuMay 22 at 4:47 PM\n(2020) Beatsaber with personal coaches\n\n-NOT A SPONSORED REVIEW-\n\nLiterally.

But I did have to cancel my subscription for two reasons. The first one is the 20 dollars a month, thats steep especially seeing that its the average cost of a full game. I understand that it must have been an expensive game to make and keep supported, but I think its asking a bit to much for what it is. The second reason being the trainers. Why do they have to constantly be talking. It gets so annoying to hear them every step, i do think that a little interaction from the trainer can help the experience but its just too much. If I can leave with one thing its that everyone should at least give it a try, its not going to be the new beat saber but it might be a great way for you to get some good exercise, if your willing to pony up the 20 a month \n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 3 at 6:09 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for the kind words on the quality and the environments.

I says I miss a lot more than I agree with. It is definitely a good work out and it is a lot of fun but I don't know if it's worth $20/month/user.

The movements are natural and make sense, the environments are very detailed and the music choices fit the workouts. The thing that really sets it apart are the trainers. Having a real human encouraging you and reminding you to use correct form is what transforms this into a real workout................but I cant recommend it for one reason, the load times in between songs are terrible. It sometimes takes 3-4 minutes to load the next song and by that time youve completely cooled down from the previous song. Thats about 40% of your workout time JUST STANDING THERE WAITING.

Why do you incorporate these ultra fast segments requiring you to switch arms back and forth like you are trying out a song on Expert+ in Beat Saber?\n\nSupernatural is clearly not Beat Saber, it's trying to create and fill a niche VR concept like Peloton. A lot of the elements are there and at first impression I think Supernatural might pull it off.

I didn't get so much as a \"How do you do?\" before this game started railing me.\n\nEdit: I tried this a few more times and the way they chose to manage difficulty is ridiculous. I noticed a lot of the songs say [Dynamic Difficulty] so it's entirely possible that the difficulty is scaling up automatically and far too quickly. I'm not sure, but whatever it is it's idiotic. I lose interest every time it ramps up and overewhelms me with orbs.\n\nThese are 15 to 20 minute workouts and 5 minutes in it goes into the equivalent of Hard/Expert on Beat Saber. Every workout I tried.\n\nThe workouts need to stay easy until you complete them. Period. Then, ask the user if they want to step it up for the NEXT workout. This really isn't complicated, I can't believe the Supernatural team thought it made more sense to implement a more difficult to code Dynamic Difficulty at the risk of pissing off a user mid workout.\n\nI'm uninstalling and unsubscribing before I'm billed.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMay 6 at 8:31 AM\n\nHey there - thanks for the response and the feedback on the workout difficulty.

While its great for sweating, the problem with the bad mapping of the orbs and often weird movement patterns seems to be getting worse with some of the workouts. Namely, theres a trainer named Leanne Pedante, and her latest workouts are noticeably worse in terms of non-intuitive movements - especially transitioning from lunges to swings. So it might be that it varies from trainer to trainer. There is no way its feasible to transition from left lunge to right and then immediately change your feet position and squat while swinging diagonally - its simply ridiculous. If Im wrong - then please make a video with one of the trainers actually showing the proper form doing one of those movements - because Ive already almost twisted my kneecaps several times while doing the Pros Only workout. Speaking of which, Im doing this workout pretty much every time, and if I hear one more time how Leanne went to Kendrick Lamars concert in LA, Im going to flip. The fact that every other reviewer brought up the issue of the trainers constantly talking, and how theres still no way to mute them, deserves an adjusted rating of 1 star.\n\n\n\nInitial review:\n\nWas really excited about this one, after seeing the trailer.\n\nThe visual part is beautiful, clean and stylish - a great mix of amazing natural landscapes and minimalist aesthetic.\n\nThe idea with using the trainers was probably a big hit with the game designers. Not with me though - the trainers basically never stop talking, constantly distracting you from the music and the rhythm. The first thing I tried to do is turn them off - but wow - you can only slightly lower their volume, thats it!\nFrom calibrating your height to every last beat of every song - there is constant talking and talking. You almost feel a condescending tone coming from them and I felt annoyed quite a few times.\n\nI wish the same amount of work was put into the actual gameplay. The workouts are pretty good and exhausting, but the mapping on the spheres is pretty bad - it always felt like my controllers were low on battery - tried replacing them and nothing changed. Im playing Beat Saber on Expert level confidently, and the orbs and bats felt somewhat weird and non-intuitive at times.\n\nThe game crashed my headset several times, and the trainer videos froze every other time. That should be fixed asap.\n\nThe music selection in playlists was random at best.\n\nOverall, what I really liked is the visuals here - really helps to have the beautiful landscapes like Iceland. The minimalist aesthetic also looks great and fresh.\n\nWhat I didnt like the most is that the game never lets you feel like a bada$$. You know the feeling in Beat Saber or BoxVr, when youre doing a new track, and its tough but also really intuitive, and you somehow manage to hit the blocks perfectly, feeling entranced while the dopamine hits. Never happened here so far. You always doubt if your next orb hit will register, while the trainer just keeps doing their obligatory pre-recorded pep talk thing...\n\nAnd dont even get me started on the $19/month subscription - this is just laughable. As much as I love and support VR, this idea gets a big NO from me.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Witcher.IIIApr 27 at 8:48 AM\nA great alternate Beat Saber\n\nSo... it's Beat Saber. Let's not pretend this is something other than Beat Saber so we can get right to the other stuff. I really LOVE the graphics. They are just amazing and it's one of the better looking Quest games out there. I like the feeling of working out in a place that makes you want to take a deep breath. I like the music. It's not stuff I'd likely listen to outside of the game, but in the game it's spot on. I like the way the coaches are portrayed. They sort of follow you when you move side to side- like they project as if they're always looking at you- and they seem life size. So I like that. As far as the game goes- I like the way the lunges work and the squats and core turns- I even like the graphics for the orbs you have to hit.\nWhat I didn't like. I don't think the hit detection is up to snuff. I'm a very experienced Beat Saber player and I got a lot of hits marked as misses and that distracted from the game for me. It's not exactly as easy to see which color you're supposed to be hitting because of the glare on the shiny part of the 'directional bubble' casing on top of the orbs.\nAnd the big issue for me- the subscription based service. It's absurdly overpriced. $20 a month is out of sync with the market. $3-$5 maybe. And even that would likely be canceled after a few months. Make this a $30 price tag- flat- and I'll come back. Honestly. But at this rate- I'll use it for 30 days and I'll enjoy it- but subscription based services that can potentially rack up that sort of price isn't realistic today. Not when games like Box VR or Beat Saber are flat fees and do very, very similar gameplay experiences.\nUnless there are major- MAJOR game changes coming soon- like totally different game options- this will be a flawed experiment and that's a shame as I really do like the idea of the environments.\n\nHelpful | 1", "echozauroraApr 27 at 12:45 PM\nGood workout, has issues\n\nI love the concept, getting a full body guided workout with gorgeous backdrops.

It would be better to have the ability to download the day's workout during the night automatically to store locally for say, a week before overwriting with the next week's workout.

It doesnt act like I hit the targets but after the session it says I hit more than I thought which is great but it throws me off and I get frustrated. Ive also felt some of the targets are set a little too close than they should be for the proper movement you start tangling up your arms. As for the triangles for squats and lunges, I love it. I really hope to see a lot more of it but I just started the free 30 days so hopefully I will. As for the trainers talking, it doesnt bother me I was a trainer so i get the idea. I just tune them out focus on music. I did spend some time cussing one out, that was relaxing lol. Lastly the price, dont think so...sorry $19 is not something Id be willingly to pay especially with some adjustments needed and not to give the game away but dont you want to charge something that if somebody forgets here and there you still get paid! $19, I wont forget about\n\nHelpful | 0", "Tim.AntonacciApr 26 at 1:05 PM\nIm glad theres a free trial\n\nIve used this for a few days now and Ill see the trial through but I have some issues with it that I would like to see before deciding to keeping it.\n\nI like that the workouts get you moving , sweating, breathing hard and the heart rate up. The environments and the music are both great.\n\nBUT...Im finding it a bit frustrating. I appreciate the dynamic skill level but I wish that it could be set manually and you have the option to increase it when you feel ready to step it up. I have a few partial workouts because I was just flailing my arms around trying to keep up and didnt want to injure myself with improper form and movement . Also the orbs being black and white make them blend into the background at times. an option for contrasting colors would be great. I would like see 180 option cause even with a play area thats 7x9 the lunges and turning made my guardian appear too often.\n\nI would also would like to see fit bit added as a tracker. Its one of more popular trackers out there. I can still track heart rate on my own but when heart rate is a feature of the game having that as an option would be nice.\n\nI hope that improvements are made because I like being challenged but I also want to have fun playing. Beat saber, box vr, and pistol whip do a good job of giving me a workout that is fun, challenging and allow me to slowly build up my skill level so that Im not frustrated.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DeathoscopeApr 26 at 10:29 PM\nI really want to like this and would pay\n\nMan this is such a great idea! Take Beat Saber and make it a TRUE work out game, but all this feels like is Beat Saber lock on an expert level and with a personal trainers voice in the back ground. This should be a workout app based on actually getting you to do repeatable EASY motions to get your heart rate up and your muscles activated. Instead there is a constant barrage of sometimes random seeming targets coming at you. In rare moments there are some repeating patterns where you get a chance to memorize the movement and get a flow going. This is when my heart rate goes up and I start to feel the exercise. Unfortunately this happens rarely. Im not trying to get good at Beat Saber Im trying to get a work out! Too much game and not enough work out imo.\nOne thing they did get right is the triangles to get you into lunges and squats. Those work great and always get my legs burning.\nPlease make at least half of the content actually focused on simple repeatable good exercise and movement instead of difficult to memorize patterns.

You get a good workout in as long as you put in the effort and will only be as good as you strive it to be.\n\nThe reason for two stars... bugs lately have cause major loading issues. To the point where some games wont even start... or it will just stop loading when switching to the next stage, therefore ending your workout short. Quite frustrating. I get its in continuous development, but if youre going to charge a subscription fee where two months will basically pay off the entire game for most high quality games, there shouldnt be an issue as like this. Taking off two stars for each the price and bugs, and an extra star for that reason. With the price being paid, I dont want my workout ending short or not even be able to play it.\n\nIll renew but if the issue persists, definitely cancelling.\n\nHelpful | 0", "jmgeroMay 20 at 3:20 PM\nNot for gamers, for exercise class users\n\nFirst the good:. The app gives you a free trial so you can see if it is for you. Also, I think it will give a decent workout, so if you want an exercise class app, this is for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are a gamer like me, looking for an app that provides exercise as a bonus, this is not it.\n\nThe bad:. This is supposed to be so fun you don't notice it being a workout. As a gamer, I consider that goal an epic fail. First, I did not find the interface intuitive at all, and the \"adaptive\" feature that is supposed to speed up or slow things down to match your was not noticeable. It came across more like a mind problem for me than a fun workout as you have to really think about what the various symbols want you to do. Definitely not intuitive like Beat Saber. I got so frustrated trying to figure out how I was supposed to move that I just gave up the first time I tried it. Other reviewers have stated they thought it was fun which is what drew me in., Fun is not what I would call my experience. After giving it a second try, I realized part of my problem is I have never been in a workout class in my life, so I had no idea what a side lunge is, and that is a big part of the app. I did do a tiny bit better the second night, but once things sped up I couldn't help thinking of it as a pale imitation of Beat Saber. In fact, both times I tried this app I ended up doing Beat Saber for a half hour afterwards so I could have some FUN exercise In my opinion, this app totally failed at the supposed purpose of making a workout fun. It is a workout, but it wasn't fun. Also, if today's top 40 music is not your cup of tea, you're out of luck. Some ability to change music to fit varying tastes would be nice. Hard for me to get excited about a workout to songs I really don't like. Please note that the primary claim for behind price is so they can have access two lots of night new none of which I personally like. So like just about everybody else who reviewed the game oh, the price point doesn't work for me. If you are 18 you may feel differently.\n\nI don't do exercise classes at all. So, if you are looking for a substitute for exercise class, this review may not be applicable to you. One last thing, supposedly, one gets an email link once you sign up to get a free sweat free cover for your Quest. The site even mentions you are free to keep it just for trying the app... Except I never got an email with my link for the free item. Not a big deal to me as I already canceled, but broken promises right from the start are typically a good predictor of what kind of support to expect from this exercise app (please do not think of it as a game). After reading some absolutely glowing reviews for this app that really build it up I was incredibly disappointed in it. My guess is that those who like exercise class might be the ones who think this is fun but if you like to play games and like to get some exercise without that being the only point, this is not for you.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 20 at 4:29 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback and giving the Supernatural fitness experience a try.

For whatever reason, that experience made me feel sad and empty. The tutorial for this game brought me back to that feeling. While I know that some people (usually young adults with high incomes) like this sort of workout experience, it is absolutely cringeworthy for me. Working out for me is either pounding weights, running, or more recently playing Thrill of the Fight or Pistol Whip. This app and type of workout experience was 100% not made for me, and I suspect, not made for the main demographic which has an Oculus Quest (given the initial reviews). Nice try, but I either want to be tricked into exercising with a super fun game, or just go do the old fashioned thing. I can not recommend this to anyone although I suspect once the Peloton crowd eventually gets into VR, theyll like this.\n\nHelpful | 3", "AlexxounetApr 25 at 2:41 PM\nLove the concept....BUT TOO HARD!\n\nLove the gameplay, how stimulating and exciting the design is.

Yes. Its too high. But the bigger problem to me is the presentation. The balls and directions could definitely be more intuitive. The triangles are not very well thought out. It takes a minute to realize whether or not its a squat or a lunge. Yes, that can be learned with time and concentration. But it should be mindless so I can just do it in one fluid movement without any question whether Im doing the right thing. Next is the hit boxes. Dear developers, fix this first. The hit boxes are so bad I quit. I understand that hitting these balls isnt as important as with other games with the whole workout aspect but seriously the unresponsive nature of these balls is just infuriating. Finally the music. Who cares about any of these tracks. Get some throw away tracks, its a workout app not a radio channel (See Box VR for reference)\n\nTLDR: price is high. Not intuitive. Awful hit boxes. Drop the licensed music \n\nHelpful | 2", "PeterDoggyMay 13 at 3:09 PM\nReasonable workout, overpriced, defects\n\nThe one good thing: It is a good workout. A better workout, in fact, then Beat Saber that it is an obvious knockoff of. It works you harder, more areas of the body, and the structure of a timed workout is useful if you are using it (as intended) for exercise.\n\nLots and lots of weaknesses:\n1. Everyone knows it is massively overpriced, especially for what it really is. I am unlikely to pay for it after the first 30 days and I absolutely will not pay for it after the pandemic lets me get back to the gym.\n2. The music sucks. I mean, some people like really sucky music, but I don't and it is annoying. The music on Beat Saber is nothing I would listen to on its own, but it is inoffensive and appropriate to the them. Supernatural's music (which I assume they are paying a lot for) outright sucks.\n3. The natural backgrounds, which are part of its main gimmick, can be moderately pleasant, but also very distracting. I have some acrophobia, so the peak of a volcano is not actually where I would like to be swinging my arms around. It is stupid that they cannot personalize your landscape preferences.\n4. The \"instructors\" are straight, low effort bots, and kind of annoying ones at that. If they are tailoring what they say to the individual it is not apparent, or it is at least within a very narrow range. Most of what they say is also really mind numbing self-actualization stuff. I find myself saying stfu, and fu quit a lot, even though I know they are bots.\n5. Its really not personalized at all. If it were you would have more options to choose landscapes, music that doesn't suck, and perhaps bot instructors that you find less annoying.\n\nIf you want a free workout thing I would say its reasonable to try. Its not anywhere near worth the price, if it is worth paying for at all.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Raemon77723 days ago\nHandles spotty internet poorly\n\nI was all set out to give this five stars, and rave about it to my friends, and declare it the best experience on the Oculus I had had, totally worth $20/month. But... very quickly I ran into a problem where it as soon as my internet gets spotty at all, the game awkwardly pauses, and then to get it running again I have to go to the main menu, turn wifi off and then on again.\n\nI'm fine requiring an internet connection when the game first launches, and when downloading new content, but it shouldn't be interrupting a workout.

Why would I pay a monthly fee for an equal or lesser workout? Trainers and licensed popular music aren't enough selling points for me.\n\nAlso, the 360 rotation adds very little to the exercise level so some workouts tailored more to a unidirectional space would definitely make this program more convenient and effective in some situations (due to not having to reposition yourself cautiously in your physical space).\n\nHelpful | 2", "iwaslikeyoMay 12 at 7:17 PM\nDynamic difficulty\n\nPlease, please... I mean please! Allow me to tinker with the difficulty of these workouts even a little bit. Im no novice to VR. Can hold my own in Beat Saber, preordered by Quest, etc., but I spend 90% of my workout frustrated and unmotivated because the difficulty is bare minimum 15% over my ability the whole time. This is ok for a Beat Saber-type game where score and accuracy and improving those things are everything, but for a game that is built principally around momentum, movement and motivation, not providing your users a little more control over their destiny feels unnecessarily prescriptive and rather smug from a development standpoint. Providing your users the ability to move and increase their heart rate while feeling good and in-control about their workout feels like a no-brainer. Im on a free trial right now, and currently have no intention of paying for this once Im forced to. Truthfully I have little to complain about otherwise, the app is polished and well-executed in every other way, but this dynamic difficulty thing needs tweaking, because it ruins an otherwise great concept. Perhaps something like choosing between an easy, medium, or hard workout? Maybe with a second parameter where you could choose intensity? Like, if I could dial in an easy, high-intensity workout, Id be on this every day. Skill shouldnt be a necessary component to an app that should just be trying to get their users motivated about moving.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 13 at 5:05 PM\n\nHey there - thanks for the feedback.

Not worth 20 bucks a month.\n\nI am an avid player of Beat Saber and Synth Riders and other movement based games. I just found this game more of a annoying chore than fun. It didnt have very many workouts to select from and hearing the trainers voice while working out is more of a distraction to me than assistance. I really wanted the option to turn off the trainer and just workout to the music. The movements just added a left and right lunge to movements you already do playing other games.

The game might be worth $20, plus a few bucks for some dlc. But nearly $240 per year! I dont know a game worth that and this certainly isnt it.

Unlike beat saber but like BoxVr you dont die when you miss a bunch so thats good for exercise aspect. All boils down to why would anyone pay for a subscription over one time charge?

Supernatural's songs are mostly pop songs with whiney vocals and anaemic beats. There very few exceptions to this. The workout playlists are chosen for you. So, I was always stuck with songs I didn't like. The backgrounds aren't that great. They're distracting and some of the, actually make the white balls harder to see. I'm focusing on hitting the balls while largely ignoring the scenery.\n\nThere's no feedback during the song to tell you how much power is in your swing. At least Beat Saber gives you a score on each hit. It seems Supernatural wants you to do full arm swings. However, if you do well the balls come in patters that are impossible to hit with full arm swings. Either you miss on purpose or you wrist flick. Neither is fun.\n\nUnless the Supernatural devs work behind the scenes to kill custom songs on Beat Saber, there's no reason to pay $20 a month for songs you don't want. Personally, I think it'd be pretty despicable if the Supernatural team tried petition the legal system to remove custom Beat Saber songs. Especially since at least one of the head devs of Supernatural was one of the best Beat Saber mappers in existence, and wouldn't have been able to develop Supernatural without the experience gained from making custom maps.\n\nHelpful | 0", "wasikranchMay 8 at 2:01 PM\nGood concept, but not for me\n\nWell, I tried it for a few days, and it had potential but to many things were irritating. Let me be up front, I'm over 60 and I'm pretty self motivated so I don't need the instructor's voice at all and, at least for me, it took away from the experience. I wrote to the developers and they told me to turn the sound down. I tried it. But...it bothers me to pay for something and only get a piece of it. Also, I don't recognize any of the music because, well, as I've explained, I'm over 60 so it was hard to get motivated with any of the music. Yes, I know, turn it down. Again, I tried it just to get rid of both the instructors voice and the music. I can get the same workout with a couple of other programs on the Quest and no monthly fee but, alas, the same music. Also, when you get older you loose some coordination. There is very little in the way of adjusting the workouts like you can on Beat saber, and work your way up. But I loved the scenery, the concept is a good one and if they get to the point where you can eliminate the instructor, change the music for us old farts (classic rock is great) and adjust the program so you can build up speed and coordination at your own rate, I'll certainly try it out again.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Hamburger555Apr 23 at 7:19 PM\nNot bad, but too pricey\n\nNice visuals, fun workout, but definitely not worth $20/mo, Ill stick to beat saber.

It's a fitness-focused Beat Saber with beautiful landscapes at twice the monthly cost of Netflix.\n\nThere is so much great potential for this game, but I'm afraid that if the pricing model isn't adjusted, it's not going to last. The music selection has been ok so far. A couple great songs and a lot of songs with general appeal to go with the high energy, challenging and fun gameplay.\n\nWith the first month being a free trial, I've integrated it into my regular exercise schedule, as it really gives you a good work out and leaves you looking forward to the next time around.\n\nSadly, it will only be a part of my exercising habits for the free trial month. At $20/month, I cannot see what sets it apart from other music rhythm games that warrants this price tag.\n\nSure, it tracks some stats from song to song and they release a new custom 15-20min workout session every day, however it appears that there's a very limited number of songs that they use in the daily sessions, so you will hear the same one multiple times in a week. As such, I don't know why they need to charge everyone that much per month. If I'm going to be paying to hear the virtual instructors tell me to swing harder or tighten my core, I'd much rather just pay the $30 for Beat Saber or one of the other rhythm-based fitness games.\n\nThe devs have an uphill battle to show why people should be paying $20/mo. This isn't a live, in-person fitness class of 20 people per instructor that includes the cost of equipment. This is thousands of people with a recording of an instructor and each person has to pay $500 for their own equipment.\n\nIf it was $5/month, I would have been praising this game and recommending it to everyone, and I'm sure many others would be doing the same. Hopefully they rethink their pricing model down the line or at least bring in tiered pricing.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 7 at 12:17 PM\n\nThanks for giving us a try.

Not because Im exhausted (I do CrossFit), but because the movements are not intuitive AT ALL! I also choreograph, and these movements just do not flow well. The purpose of the movement being to the music is so that your natural movement to the music helps you hit the targets. Several times I turned off the app because I got frustrated with the movement being so odd and taking me out of my groove. Every now and then on Beat Saber, you may run into part of a map that is a bit challenging, but you have the option to go and practice it over and over. However, I play Beat Saber to feel like a ninja with a sword, not workout. From a workout app, I want REPETITIVE, INTUITIVE, FULL BODY movement that makes me feel confident. And if the workout app has music that I am supposed to move to, then I want to feel like Im dancing as well. BoxVr is very simple and I like it! Even though its just jabs and hooks, I still can get into a groove to the music, moving my hips and rocking to the beat.\n\nThis app can be much better.

I like how it works in 360 degrees. This feature really helps to promote flexibility and range of movement more than many other fitness apps. The backgrounds are beautiful. The varied types of exercises are also really good.\n\nUnfortunately, all that is lost because the workouts are not scaled. I'm coordinated and used to rhythm games in VR, but I got completely overwhelmed trying to track everything coming at me. Part way through my first workout I realized that I was just ignoring all the squats and lunges in order to try to keep up with the targets. I felt discouraged, quit that workout, and tried one that seemed more chill. Nope. Same experience. I then realized I had wasted 20-30 minutes and had barely raised my heart rate.\n\nFeeling successful is a huge part of a good workout routine. You have to nail that above everything else. I felt terrible, quit out of the app, and switched to Box VR--great workout. I just wished I had the extra 20-30 minutes back to spend exercising properly.\n\nOne of the selling points of this app is customization. There are going to be people far less coordinated and less fit than me that will a worse experience.\n\nI don't want to spend much time on the pricing model, but for the subscription they are asking it better be suited for people at all levels. It should also support people through their learning curve.\n\nHelpful | 1", "emrys90Apr 28 at 6:45 AM\n\nI'm running into three majors issues for myself that have me strongly tempted to cancel the trial and go back to Beat Saber.\n\nThe first is the songs. The workouts have no consistency with the songs chosen for that workout. For example, some workouts seem to be a mix of pop and rap songs. That's targeting different demographics. There should be consistency in the songs chosen for a workout, and I don't mean just all pop for all rap. I mean each song should be chosen in a way that is similar to the previous song chosen. This would allow a workout to someone that likes that kind of music, without forcing them to go through songs they dislike. Then different workouts use different types of music, so people have their options on what to use. Personally, I strongly dislike rap, and I am getting tired of being forced to go through those songs.\n\nMy next issue is with the trainers. At the beginning and end for warmup/cooldown stretches, it's actually useful. You can see them and watch them going through the stretches to match them. However, during the songs, it's completely useless. At best hearing them is a cool gimmick, and at worst it gets annoying. At first I didn't mind, but listening to them every day for almost a week now has started to get annoying. They talk too much, interrupting your flow and distracting you from the songs, for no benefit at all. It's not like they can talk and give you feedback and correct your form. It's all prerecorded messages, and pointless.\n\nMy next issue is with the dynamic difficulty. In theory, it sounded great. In practice, however, it limits you from pushing yourself. I tried the one hard mode only workout available, and got such a better workout than the others because I had to move much faster to attempt to hit the targets, even if overall I was less accurate. If someone wants to push themselves, even while being less accurate, that should be their choice. Instead you are forcing them into what they are most accurate at.\n\nHelpful | 1", "vallone002May 29 at 7:31 PM\nPoor choice of songs\n\nToo expensive with not enough content to warrant the subscription.

Our choreographers are always building new workouts to new music in hopes that this will bring you something new to look forward to in your workouts every day. We decidedly did not include a HUD during workouts so that you can be engaged 1:1 with your movements.

Better to do pay as you go DLC workouts. I dont need fresh workouts at $19 a month. I think you should really rethink this because you have a really great product here. But we are not all made of money. The countrys in a huge recession. Not your fault, but maybe pivot like we all have had to do. At least until you have WAY more content available.\n\npros: Made me sweat big time, polished game. Graphics are A+ for sure!\n\nNeed to be able to mute trainer if you so choose, as well as pick the songs you want. The lack of customization at this price point, well another con IMO.\n\nMusic, good and bad, but not everyone is into working out to songs that dont vibe with them. That is were customizable workouts are needed (and maybe that is coming).\n\nAudioshield is a basic game in comparison, but i get almost the same intensity of workout and it sends the targets at me synced to any custom mp3 I want. Box VR, is really really good too and not monthly subscription either. I know its apples and oranges but there are some things to take away from their value as well.\n\nLoose the monthly fee and charge me for DLC and I will be ALL IN!

I love that you can pair your watch to track heart rate and getting instructed by a pre-recorded trainer, but... The cost is worrisome, and I'll, unfortunately, be cancelling my membership. I'll still be playing, though! The cost is around 6 USD more than Peloton, which has live instructors instead of pre-recorded. Heck, we even have a quite good gym here in the city that's 15 CAD per month, making it the cheapest out of these two when converted to USD. 25 CAD a month is a huge yikes, and Supernatural will most definitely have to change to compete with it's competitors; either adding enough content and features for the subscription to have great value for it's price, or the price is lowered. 9.99 USD a month sounds like something I would pay at most.\n\nHelpful | 7", "L.E.D.BLUEApr 26 at 6:00 AM\nNot worth the money.\n\n$240 a year, they want $240 a year for a mobile VR Beat Saber clone.\n\nHelpful | 4", "MooMooKindApr 25 at 7:16 AM\nAwesome but tons of room for improvement\n\nIm a huge Beat Saber fan and also love creative fitness ideas, so this was right up my alley! This review comes only after the initial intro and one training session (Im in the 30 day evaluation). My first 15 min workout absolutely left me feeling like I got a solid workout. I was even sweating. Sadly my Apple Watch was charging so I didnt get to pair it but I will next workout. The music and how its synced to the targets is excellent.\n\nImprovements:\n1.) I was super bummed to see the lack of social media sharing of a completed workout. Not only would this help spread the word of Supernatural but it shows social media friends that people are using it and having a great time doing so. I feel like this is a launch day failure.\n2.) Since the goal of a workout is fitness and not failing a level like in beat saber, I think the app needs to account for a larger target hitting area. I found that while I was super accurate it wouldnt register some hits. That alone (by not feeling the shake of the controller) through off my next couple hits.\n3.) Price. This remains to be seen with the amount of content added. The trainers (as of this review) are nothing more than a voice over during a session. That being said I feel like the price is very high right now and Ill likely cancel after 30 days if I dont see more workouts and more trainer motivation.\n4.) target colors. We should have the option to change left/right target colors. The grey and black I found blended in a bit much to the background.\n5.) IPhone App. I feel like there needs more substance in the app. I also found a bug if you click add description and dont add one that it doesnt let you add it again.\n\n\nOverall its a good start. People are going to compare to Beat Saber but I think there is potential here. The price will need tweaking based on my comments above. You have me for at least 30 days to make an impression.\n\nHelpful | 3", "khairih100Apr 26 at 7:52 AM\nNice\n\nNice\n\nHelpful | 5", "NonnaBMay 2 at 10:04 AM\nIn my opinion.....\n\nFirst of all let me start off with I am new to the VR world, but have experiemented with MULTIPLE games/apps/programs over the last few weeks. I love my quest and its abilities so much we now have 3 total in our home. This is a lengthy review, but it touches on all points made in other reviews I read before I downloaded & tried this app.... I gave it 4  because the \"trial\" alone is worth the time!\n\nThis program should not be compared to BeatSaber, Synth Ryders or Box VR bc this is not a game (I have all of them). It IS a virtual fitness program with live personal trainers. You will have them in your ear & face throughout your work out/training, so not to mess up concentration, but to keep you on track and motivate you to push harder. You cannot mute them in person, lol. They are there to assist to make sure you are using the right \"form\". As anyone who exercises, you know if you do not have the proper form you are not getting the most out of your work out and you could injure yourself.\n\nImagery: Stunning is an understatement. I have not seen more life like images so real that you want to actually jump in and swim in the Galapagos Islands! Wander doesn't even have the crystal clear images that this app has - LOVE the serenity of the images. Even the volcano's seem relaxing when they should be terrifying !\n\nAccuracy:\nAs for accuracy in Striking, I do understand what everyone is talking about. I have noticed that my bat disappears occasionally once I pick up speed and have multiple cones. I have also missed the target when I know I should have hit it, although it was not during a \"standing\" position. I do not know yet, if it is in my own calibration at the beginning and/or a \"glitch\" in the program. Would be a good idea for the developers to look into. I restarted the \"training\" and set my calibrations a little bit further out and another a little less. The calibration seems to be the key. When you are setting calibration - you set your extension levels. Setting up calibrations and doing the actual work out are different. You are reaching, squatting and twisting in the workouts, when you calibrate - its just standing still...\n\nFinally, I take a deep sigh here as the topic of price is mentioned A LOT! Hell yes that is a steep price. Whether you have a family or are a single person, this monthly cost is too high. Now, I am older, with children & a grandchild. I also run a licensed daycare 12 hours a day, 5 days a week and have my own family after that. I also understand the costs of what goes into these programs, paying for licensing, paying the trainers and the royalty costs... BUT there are gyms (even with trainers) that charge $9.99/month that have major, continuous overhead charges such as equipment, maintenance/replacement on equipment, cleaning, building rentals and the employees, insurance etc... The \"Beach Body\" program is $100/year but they also have live interaction with coaches, meal plans etc. The goal in these types of programs are meant to aim at fitness & health, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. The cost of eating junk is much lower and the cost of getting & staying healthy is discouraging to busy, real life people & families who need accessibility to programs like this without adding stress of another bill. You can sell a few @20/month or hundreds of thousands for fraction of the price - a 3rd grade math student can see that makes more money! Hell disney plus charges $6.99/month to sit on your rear and get fat.\n\n#1 suggestion: Developers need to work on calibration techniques to account for quick movement and turns as a persons reach can go further or stop shorter with quick movement depending on speed.\n\n#2 I agree on the trainers talking, that once you get to pro and you have it down, there should be an option to either silence or at least adjust the volume on the trainer.\n\n#3 Change the monthly cost. Either one time charge or a drastically lower monthly cost. The VR is pricey enough, especially when you have more than one VR headset as I have 3... to purchase these programs PER headset is beyond ridiculous. The developers have the opportunity to get FAMILIES healthy & do it together with teaching/learning good habits that get passed on! Its a win win situation on every level: you make money, people gain more common ground with each other and focus less on social media gossip because they are too busy & happy to focus on negativity!\n\nHelpful | 2", "Ryanguz04Apr 27 at 7:06 AM\nMoney\n\n$30 for a month?

There is no way that I would give that much monthly to play a game. Not gonna happen. I understand they are trying to market as a home gym thing but the gyms around me are as much per month as this game and offer different equipment and real life instructors.\nNow for the gameplay. The surroundings were beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. The music was good. I dont know if its supposed to be like this but I found myself looking down at the instructors and floating several feet from the platform which meant that in order to fit in any of the lunge or squat triangles I would have had to practically do the splits. And some of the low swings would require me to squat/duck/lean down to hit them. That seems like a crucial misstep in calibration. I even jumped back to the home to make sure my guardian floor was set correctly. It was.\nThere was no feedback to the arcs or trails. And very little feedback to the actual orbs and triangles making me wonder did I make any of them , the end results said yes.\nI also didnt like that it needs a whole nother separate app on my phone.\nHaving an instructor is great but at the same time wouldnt it be better to have the option to just jive away with the music instead of the constant barrage of good get low keep those hips open keep your spine straight blah blah whats the point of having good music if your going to talk over it the entire time. Youd be better off using indie stuff and not paying licensing at that rate.\nI have gave up halfway through the workout frustrated and disappointed.\nI really think theyre going to have to rethink their subscription plan and work on the game mechanics a bit more. If they worked on better calibration I might try it again as a 30 or 40 one time purchase. As it is Im uninstalling.\n\nHelpful | 6", "ThermalTurboMay 9 at 8:12 AM\nAmazing, fun fitness\n\nSupernatural puts you in breathtaking environments with wonderful trainers and music in a Beat Saber-like workout experience. Most auto/high intensity workouts have me working up a massive sweat and have me tired by the end. It's an amazing fitness/workout app.\n\nA lot of people have said that $20/month is steep, and I agree somewhat. It's hard to recommend to people who want to get fit and workout casually, however for those who are dedicated to working out in VR, this is an amazing value!

To start the game technically looks and works just fine. The visuals are nice etc., the mechanics work fine... the problem is it's just BeatSaber on steroids... and I don't like BS. If you like BS then you'll likely like this if you're also into the fitness aspect of VR. While I thought BS was initially ok, it quickly became boring. Once I found PistolWhip, and then TotF, BoxVR, & Creed I have not touched it since. It simply doesn't give me the work out I'm looking for, and neither does this. I know I only played it 15 minutes, but I didn't see the point after noping out of the one song. It's BeatSaber in a different skin. That being said I can't fault it on it's execution on what it is doing. It is clearly a well designed game, with beautiful visuals, but I found the following things deal breakers very early on outside of the boring beatsaber mechanic:\n\n1. The unchangeable list of top 40 tripe they're calling music. You can't choose the songs to listen to, so have have whatever forced on you. Sure there were a couple I didn't -mind-, but I started a work out and the very first song after warm up I just noped out of because it was making me angry. I understand you can't just drop a song in and keep the beat mechanic in tact, but.. just ugh...\n\n2. Someone else noted this - but they need change or up the sound made when missing a sphere. It is hard to tell at times if you hit the target or not and I found myself turning my head to check quite often.\n\n3. Never ending chatter from Trainers & inability to mute them. VERY distracting and caused me to miss targets very frequently.\n\n4. The cost. You -have- to be kidding me. Now 20 bucks is not much to me, I'll spend twice that on lunch 3 times a week, but it's a cost vs. value thing, and they don't equal out. 5 dollars would ok, 10 is pushing it. I understand they went high - the music cost, trainer etc., but I think setting it at 20 is a strategically fatal mistake.\n\nHelpful | 3", "omair.sajidApr 23 at 4:15 PM\nCool but very expensive\n\nI like the workout.

This one doesn't do that reliably.\n\nAlso, there's absolutely no warning in the tutorial, but this is a 360 degree experience. I punched several things in my room that'd normally be safe behind me\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention the fact that you CANNOT re-center the view by holding the oculus home button. All it does is freeze the video for a few seconds while the audio keeps playing, then the video catches up and you're still standing on a slanted virtual yoga mat trying to figure out how you'll avoid punching your window\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 7 at 7:06 AM\n\nHey there - Thanks for the note. The folks at Oculus continue to improve the Quest's tracking system, making Supernatural better. If you're still having issues with tracking here are some tips to help get it back: 1) Direct sunlight is the biggest culprit. Please make sure that there is no direct sunlight hitting you during your workout. 2) You can often restore tracking by bringing your controllers in front of your face (in direct view of the Oculus headset sensors). 3) Avoid a space with reflective surfaces or mirrors. Reflections will confuse the tracking system. 4) Ensure that you are standing on directly in the center of the platform during workouts. 5) In some instances you may also find the tracking improve if you focus on hitting the target in your visual view before it moves out of your peripheral. Rule of thumb, if you can see your bats making contact with the targets then the headset sensors have a good view of the controllers, and your tracking should be consistent. 6)Make sure your batteries are fresh or well charged. We'd love to help you out with the last issue you're describing as that's definitely not consistent with what we've been hearing from our members. If you haven't already, please do reach out to us at support@getsupernatural.com. Thanks again.", "ScareproMay 12 at 6:57 PM\nJust one flaw\n\nAs a 44 year old power athlete and ex- functional fitness trainer, I really respect the design, execution and polish of the concept. The yearly membership price is completely fair given the model and constant content feed. I'm generally a \"pick heavy things up and move/push them around\" guy, and steady state cardio activities bore the hell out of me, so the Quest has given me several great options to keep me engaged while pushing cardio... Supernatural is now at the top of the list. The movements flow well, music is appropriately curated, and you are rewarded for speed and follow-through (unlike BS, Synthriders, etc), and you move your body a LOT in the 360 degree space.\nSo why not 5 stars? One glaring issue that has been mentioned before and one area of improvement that can make this even more next-level:\nGive us the option to turn OFF the trainer voices during workouts. Period. I know I can turn them DOWN, but let us turn them off. Some people like them, I get it- it's a primary sell point that sets the product apart. But for those of us who just want to fall in the zone without the distraction, it's a dealbreaker. I will GLADLY pay the yearly subscription fee if I can just choose when and whether to hear trainer voices.\nPoint of improvement- allow for adjustable play area size. In other physical rhythm games, this is an easy way to make people need to sidestep and get more lateral movement to hit targets etc. Speaking of which, some simple side-to-side obstacles like every other similar game has would make for fun flow variations (as opposed to them all essentially requiring some lunge/squat)\nYou're almost there. Full 0-100 control on that trainer audio slider and I'll revise to 5 stars.\n\nPS why does it sometimes seem to take a full 2+ min for the game to log in and pull up menu after clicking profile name? Some sort of status/connection message there would be great, because I thought the game was just hanging/freezing the first 10 times I tried to get in...\n\nHelpful | 0", "albeewApr 23 at 2:20 PM\nDecent workout but twenty bucks tops\n\nI doubt there will be many subscribers at $20 a month for a workout app comparable to Box VR and Beat Saber, both of which provide comparable workouts.

The scenery is nice, trainers models could do with a bit more work as their heads seem to be on a long neck that kind of comes towards you. I'd like to see rectangles come into the game like beat saber has as I think they are better than the triangles that this game went with.

We were both really disappointed. It was kind of boring and the movement felt very unnatural and awkward. The non-stop coaching was a bit annoying too. We much prefer a few rounds of BoxVR, Pistol Whip and Beat Saber for our VR workouts. I dont think we would be willing to pay a monthly fee, but Im really disappointed that they wouldnt at least include 2 or 3 levels in the tutorial.

Im no stranger to high priced exercise equipment, expensive hardware and monthly sub fees. This app has promise and looks like it was going for a mash-up of Peloton and Beat Saber, arguably the leaders in their respective niches. The problem is, there just isnt enough content to judge without subscribing.\n\nAfter a beginners tutorial and example workout, you cant sample any real guided workouts without agreeing to the free trial. We all know what thats like and Im loathe to agree to a free trial without knowing more, lest I must jump through 10 hoops to cancel if I change my mind. These things can be like trying to leave the mob! So you have no idea about the quality of the instructors, numbers of environments, available music, and variety of workouts. Thats just not going to work for me.\n\nFor $20 a month, you have to show me more steak with that sizzle. If you have a great product, stand behind it with confidence and let it close the deal with a taste I cant get enough of.\n\nOn a technical perspective, its pretty polished but still needs some adjustments. The balloons seem airy with somewhat wonky collision detection. Youll miss when you know you hit the target, which never happens in Beat Saber. You can barely hear the sound when you hit them, only adding to the sensation you are striking air. On Quest the resolution needs some improvement as well. There isnt a lot of animation going on here. Really no excuse for that with more polished graphics already executed in other titles.\n\nAll in all, it piqued my curiosity, but unfortunately not enough for me to take a stab at the free trial. I could see this charging MAYBE $10/mo if the content is kept fresh, but $20 is on the high side.

Takes FOREVER and if you didnt register the first time (Most people wouldnt if theyre just trying to explore to see if they like it), they make you go through the entire on boarding again. Its at least 15 minutes and theres no way to skip it. Once you finally do get to choose workouts, the descriptors are so confusing you have no idea what type of workout youre about to get. Once that starts, youre spending another couple minutes with the trainers talking to you. Too much trainer screen time, too much talking. Totally takes you out of the experience. I also agree with others about the hit targets arent quite right and the sound/feedback for hitting them is less satisfying than comparable experiences.\n\nIn the future I would like to see the on boarding and trainer cut-scenes shortened or customizable.

Unfortunately there are a lot of bugs and annoying features.\n\nThe workouts start with an unnecessary description by the trainer - I selected the workout so I already read the description and list of songs, I don't need this. The trainers also appear to be leaning forward towards you at an unnatural angle through a platform that I assume they're supposed to be standing on. Throughout the workout the trainer talks nearly constantly, ironically telling you to feel the music, which I have a hard time doing because of all the talking. Additionally, between each section of the workout there is an extremely long loading time, sometimes up to several minutes. The game would also freeze and have glitches where the trainers showed up with the menu embedded through them.\n\nThe necessary play area is also much larger than needed for most other games, so it makes it very limited where you can play.\n\nThis could be a great game/workout if the developers fixed all the bugs, offered more that a few very limited workouts and brought the monthly cost down considerably. I haven't heard of or don't like most of the songs so that is not a selling point to justify the price.\n\nAfter finishing the first workout (which included an extra 10 minutes of waiting for sections of the workout to load) I got an alert that other users were requesting to follow me. Forcing users to enter their full name and then making it default to publicly display my name, profile, and workout details is a pretty serious problem in my book, so I hope that feature is removed for privacy and safety.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 25 at 5:27 PM\n\nHello, thanks for writing such a detailed review and providing so much feedback.

The balloons come at you too fast for you to have long, powerful movements with follow through, so you have to either choose to do small movements with just your wrists for accuracy or choose to miss blocks and therefore not get the full workout.
