But anyway this game is incredible and should I think anyone can enjoy playing this game.\n\nHelpful | 63", "Ashtonplaz105 days ago\nLove the game\n\nI see so many YouTube videos about Job simulator. The game is why I bought my oculus quest. I also love vacation simulator but I do want you to add more content to job simulator.

I was late to this game as I thought it may be repetitive but after buying I realised I was wrong. It was instead insanely fun and never got boring even after playing the infinite mode and doing pretty much the same thing over and over again.\n\nHelpful | 64", "LyimJul 23 at 10:30 AM\nEssential Game\n\nIf you're considering purchasing Job Simulator or Vacation Simulator, consider Vacation Simulator first and then consider Job Simulator while it's on a sale or something. Vacation simulator is a drastically better game than Job Simulator. Although they are both great games and what I would consider essential to have as a quest owner. Vacation Simulator just has much more to do!\n\nHelpful | 8", "Galapagos12Jun 3 at 8:10 AM\nFantastic Game!\n\nJob Simulator is easily the PERFECT game to introduce someone to VR. On the surface, doing things like running a cash register or working on cars doesnt sound terribly exciting, but once you begin doing it, you dont want to stop (which is fine, because theres an endless mode)! This game is cute, its fun for both kids and adults, and it had me, an adult man, laughing at a LOT of its dumb, hilarious writing. If youre looking causal fun, this is ABSOLUTELY the game for you.\n\nHelpful | 84", "lday19Jun 19 at 10:54 AM\nAmazing\n\nLuv dis game\nAdd a barista/coffee shop/Starbucks job pls that will be rlly fun c:\n\nBuy this game and when you complete it do infinite mode and then play it more\n\nBest game evah\n\nMy fav on my oculus :)\n\nTy for reading and buy the game pls\n\nIts rlly fun\n\nTy for reading human c:\n\n\n\n\nps buy the game\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your still reading you havent bought it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI told you buy it\n\n\n\n\nIm job bot you boss so do it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo it now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOH MY GAWD BUY PLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIF ur reading this this means youve bought it and ty c:\n\n\nTy human,\n\nJob Bot\n\nHelpful | 261", "gucci_elmo4 days ago\nDecent game.\n\nThe game is great! I only really liked the office worker and gourmet chef jobs, but the other modes are fine, too. My only problem with the game is that there isn't much replayability. Even thought infinite overtime exists, it is so different and odd. I am going to give 5 stars, because I am optimistic about getting vacation simulator soon. Anyways, great job!\n\nHelpful | 1", "MrTimeMachine3 days ago\nMUST HAVR\n\nHonestly i don't like the game that much anymore, but having it on Oculus Quest and showing this game to others who have never tryed VR before is amazing.

This is probably the best first game for anyone that is just looking for a game to introduce you to VR. My only complaint is that there are only 4 jobs. I get that there is infinite overtime but still. There should be a manager position for some of the jobs. There should also be jobs for like design work, newscaster, and other things like that. I love the simplicity of it but also wish for more tasks in infinite overtime because if you play infinite overtime for longer than 30 minutes you tend to repeat the same task about 3 times. I also understand that they dont really focus on this game anymore, but these would be some simple things to add.\n\nHelpful | 9", "alienslasher30003 days ago\nI think my game is broken...\n\nSo every time there is an update and i go to store clerk it has the new update.

Due to the smooth physics of the game it really emerses (soz idk how to spell) you to vr. But i would love to see hand tracking in this game, mainly for boomers that dont know about modern gaming (thisway it is easier for them to play as they can grab things, and also to make it more real feeling and more fun. The fact that you can pretty much interact with everything. It would be great for users to make there own hand gestures. One more thing id like to see in this game is more reactions from the robots as you throw things at thrm or steel there accessories e.c.t\n\nHelpful | 82", "Spagetti0712 days ago\nAMAZING!!!!!\n\nI got into Job Simulator when my cousin let me play on it, I loved it so much that when I went to his house, I immediately asked him to play on it.

It was insanely addictive and I still cant stop playing and making my job of choice even more fun!\n\nHelpful | 0", "kas.speed22Jul 22 at 1:39 PM\nAmazing game but....\n\nI really enjoyed this game when I first bought it, it was one of my first VR games I purchased. What I found really fascinating is the idea you could interact with practically everything at your job, which was rare to find in a VR game. The only downside to this game is you get done very quickly with each job, I wish there were more jobs to choose from as well. I bought the game one day and already finished two jobs within two days. However, the game is amazing and fun for all ages and the perfect game to start off your VR experience.\n\nHelpful | 9", "Gavotron4468Jul 27 at 9:25 AM\nH E L L O H U M A N\n\nI see you are reading this {RATING/REVIEW} This app is very {GAME} I had lots of {ENJOYMENTS} I highly recommend this game human!\n\nHelpful | 9", "SpenceDMann16 days ago\nGenius with more potential for greatness\n\nI love the subtle lore, reminds me of such post apocalyptic cultures like Demolition Man and Fallout, when a future culture tries to understand a modern day culture only getting something lost in translation.

Even though its past its time for what VR now has to offer, it is still fun and somewhat addicting ( to me anyways ). It just has a nice cheesy vibe to the game. You can select between 4 different jobs, and 3 different modes for those jobs. I would say that this is a Must in your library, but everyone says that, so I will say this game is worth a shot, even though it sounds really weird. (Who would want to do a virtual job?). Although it sounds like that, it isnt what the game has to offer. Its an enjoyable experience and I think you might enjoy it too. And as a +, ingame bugs are hard to come across on here.\n\nHelpful | 0", "BandszoJul 25 at 3:33 PM\nSimply Amazing\n\nJob simulator is something you'd see out of a cartoon. It's something I never thought was actually possible. The idea is amazing and it's a must have for your library. But it does have it's up's and down's. There aren't enough job's. gourmet chef, auto mechanic, office worker, and convince store clerk are all great jobs but if there could be more that'd be great. It's comedic and really funny when you get to some levels. Say, you're in the convince store and your on the level where you get \"robbed\" the fact that bandit bot is threatening you with a banana make's me burst into laughter. In short Job Simulator is 5 stars in my opinion.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Majorpike327 days ago\nReally good\n\nIt's really fun to mess around in or play normally, me, my nephew , my uncle and my cousin's all love it\n\nHelpful | 1", "CraftierACE4 days ago\nA Fun, Relaxing Game\n\nJob Simulator is a VR comedic simulation game where you have 4 jobs that require you to do different tasks depending on the customer. The controls feel very good, nothing feels too finicky or hard to control. The gameplay is very relaxing, and with bits of comedic dialogue and tasks makes this game a very pleasant experience. The problem is that after the 4 main campaigns there is not much reason to replay. The achievements are fun but with only 11, I wish there was a bit more to do.

You can invite friends to play, and watch what they are doing while having a great laugh. There are several jokes scattered inside the jobs, some are part of the tasks, and some are easter eggs you have to find.\nIt takes around 30 min to complete all tasks in one job, and around 15 min more to find all easter eggs.\n\nHowever, the tasks in each job get repetitive, and this might get boring after a while. I found myself finishing tasks just to finish the game without enjoying them as much I did at the start.\nIf you are looking for a game to laugh at with friends - this is the game to get, but if you are looking for a real puzzle game, this is not a good pick.\nIt is also slightly overpriced for the experience, in my opinion.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Markedcub1887May 22 at 4:40 PM\n\nI love the game but I wish yall can add more jobs\n\nHelpful | 3", "Asher603Jun 13 at 9:15 AM\nIt was fun!\n\nI don't know, just the quirky vibe from this caught my eye, I played it, finished it within a couple hours, and spent most my time in the free play section.\n\nTl;dr : It's a short yet very fun game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Wrestle2win80Jun 16 at 6:27 AM\nAwesome game\n\nThere is so much to do 100% buy this game game\n\nHelpful | 0", "NunForeYouJun 26 at 6:29 PM\nAwsome!\n\nbest VR game I've ever played\n\nHelpful | 1", "OculusKing007May 24 at 4:24 AM\nReally good but could improve\n\nI love Job Simulator, in fact it is my favourite game on the Quest.

To make the game EVEN better, I would suggest adding a couple more job scenarios as the current ones have been there since 2016 and once they have been completed, the game is effectively \"over\" there is infinite overtime of course but adding new jobs will attract new people to the game and bring back past players.

That's a rumor.\n\n\nDo these look like rumors?\n\n\nThat's a conspiracy theory.\nThese are obviously doctored photos.\n\n\nHow did you get mixed up in this?\n\n\nHe's been talking to humans.\n\n\n- What?\n- Talking to humans?!\n\n\nHe has a human girlfriend.\nAnd they make out!\n\n\nMake out? Barry!\n\n\nWe do not.\n\n\n- You wish you could.\n- Whose side are you on?\n\n\nThe bees!\n\n\nI dated a cricket once in San Antonio.\nThose crazy legs kept me up all night.\n\n\nBarry, this is what you want\nto do with your life?\n\n\nI want to do it for all our lives.\nNobody works harder than bees!\n\n\nDad, I remember you\ncoming home so overworked\n\n\nyour hands were still stirring.\nYou couldn't stop.\n\n\nI remember that.\n\n\nWhat right do they have to our honey?\n\n\nWe live on two cups a year. They put it\nin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\n\n\nEven if it's true, what can one bee do?\n\n\nSting them where it really hurts.\n\n\nIn the face! The eye!\n\n\n- That would hurt.\n- No.\n\n\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\n\n\nThere's only one place you can sting\nthe humans, one place where it matters.\n\n\nHive at Five, the hive's only\nfull-hour action news source.\n\n\nNo more bee beards!\n\n\nWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\n\n\nWeather with Storm Stinger.\n\n\nSports with Buzz Larvi.\n\n\nAnd Jeanette Ohung.\n\n\n- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.\n- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.\n\n\nA tri-county bee, Barry Benson,\n\n\nintends to sue the human race\nfor stealing our honey,\n\n\npackaging it and profiting\nfrom it illegally!\n\n\nTomorrow night on Bee Larry King,\n\n\nwe'll have three former queens here in\nour studio, discussing their new book,\n\n\nOlassy Ladies,\nout this week on Hexagon.\n\n\nTonight we're talking to Barry Benson.\n\n\nDid you ever think, \"I'm a kid\nfrom the hive. I can't do this\"?\n\n\nBees have never been afraid\nto change the world.\n\n\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\n\n\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\n\n\nWe were thinking\nof stickball or candy stores.\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\nThe bee community\nis supporting you in this case,\n\n\nwhich will be the trial\nof the bee century.\n\n\nYou know, they have a Larry King\nin the human world too.\n\n\nIt's a common name. Next week...\n\n\nHe looks like you and has a show\nand suspenders and colored dots...\n\n\nNext week...\n\n\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\n\n\nBear Week next week!\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\n\n\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\n\n\nIn tennis, you attack\nat the point of weakness!\n\n\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\n\n\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\n\n\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\n\n\n- Is that that same bee?\n- Yes, it is!\n\n\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\n\n\n- Hello.\n- Hello, bee.\n\n\nThis is Ken.\n\n\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\nten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\n\n\nWhy does he talk again?\n\n\nListen, you better go\n'cause we're really busy working.\n\n\nBut it's our yogurt night!\n\n\nBye-bye.\n\n\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\n\n\nYou poor thing.\nYou two have been at this for hours!\n\n\nYes, and Adam here\nhas been a huge help.\n\n\n- Frosting...\n- How many sugars?\n\n\nJust one. I try not\nto use the competition.\n\n\nSo why are you helping me?\n\n\nBees have good qualities.\n\n\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\n\n\nInstead of flowers, people\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\n\n\nThose are great, if you're three.\n\n\nAnd artificial flowers.\n\n\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n- Yeah, me too.\n\n\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\n\n\nBees must hate those fake things!\n\n\nNothing worse\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\n\n\nMaybe this could make up\nfor it a little bit.\n\n\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n- I guess.\n\n\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\n\n\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\n\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\n\nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\n\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\n\nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\n\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\n\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\n\nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\n\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\n\nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n\n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\n\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\n\nYou boys work on this?\n\n\nAll rise! The Honorable\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\n\n\nAll right. Oase number 4475,\n\n\nSuperior Oourt of New York,\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\n\n\nis now in session.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing\nthe five food companies collectively?\n\n\nA privilege.\n\n\nMr. Benson... you're representing\nall the bees of the world?\n\n\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n\nTalking bee!\n\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n\nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\n\nMr. Benson?\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n\nbut everything we are!\n\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n\nOall your first witness.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n\nI suppose so.\n\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n\n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n\n- No.\n- No.\n\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n\nYou mean like this?\n\n\nBears kill bees!\n\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n\n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n\nOh, please.\n\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\n\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\n\nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\n\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n\nI see from your resume\nthat you're devilishly handsome\n\n\nwith a churning inner turmoil\nthat's ready to blow.\n\n\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n\n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\n\nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n\n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\n\nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\n\nI think the jury's on our side.\n\n\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\n\nI'm a florist.\n\n\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\n\nTo a great team!\n\n\nWell, hello.\n\n\n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n\nDo we?\n\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\n\nLook at that.\n\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n\n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n\nA lot of ads.\n\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n\nNot as much.\n\n\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\n\n\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\n\n\nI've got issues!\n\n\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\n\n\n- You're bluffing.\n- Am I?\n\n\nSurf's up, dude!\n\n\nPoo water!\n\n\nThat bowl is gnarly.\n\n\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\n\n\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\n\n\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\nI don't eat it!\n\n\nWe need to talk!\n\n\nHe's just a little bee!\n\n\nAnd he happens to be\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n\n\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n\nAnd for your information,\n\n\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n\n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\n\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\n\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\n\nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\n\nto that woman?\n\n\nWe're friends.\n\n\n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow good? Do you live together?\n\n\nWait a minute...\n\n\nAre you her little...\n\n\n...bedbug?\n\n\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\n\ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n\n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n\n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\n\nHold me back!\n\n\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\n\nHe's denouncing bees!\n\n\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n\n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\n\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\n\nOh, I'm hit!!\n\n\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\n\nOrder! Order!\n\n\nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\n\nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\n\nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\n\nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n\n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\n\nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\n\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\n\nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\n\nOrder, please!\n\n\nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\n\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\n\nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n\n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n\n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\n\nI...\n\n\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\n\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n\nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\n\nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\n\nOh, my.\n\n\nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n\n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke.\n\n\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\n\nThat's it! That's our case!\n\n\nIt is? It's not over?\n\n\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\n\nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\n\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\n\nMr. Flayman.\n\n\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\n\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\n\nShow me the smoking gun!\n\n\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\n\nHere is your smoking gun.\n\n\nWhat is that?\n\n\nIt's a bee smoker!\n\n\nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\n\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\n\nLook at what has happened\n\n\nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\n\nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\n\nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\n\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\n\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n\n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\n\nVanessa, we won!\n\n\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\n\nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\n\nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\n\nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\n\nYou'll regret this.\n\n\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\n\nAll right. One at a time.\n\n\nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\n\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n\n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\n\nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\n\nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\n\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\n\nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\n\nevery last drop.\n\n\nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\n\nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\n\nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\n\nWait for my signal.\n\n\nTake him out.\n\n\nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\n\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\n\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\n\nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\n\nOan't breathe.\n\n\nBring it in, boys!\n\n\nHold it right there! Good.\n\n\nTap it.\n\n\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n\n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\n\nShut down honey production!\n\n\nStop making honey!\n\n\nTurn your key, sir!\n\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\n\nOannonball!\n\n\nWe're shutting honey production!\n\n\nMission abort.\n\n\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\n\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\n\nOh, yeah?\n\n\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n\n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\n\nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n\nI heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n\nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\n\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n\nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\n\nAnd now...\n\n\nNow I can't.\n\n\nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\n\nI thought their lives would be better!\n\n\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\n\nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n\n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThat is not the half of it.\n\n\nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\n\nThey're all wilting.\n\n\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\n\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\n\nBees?\n\n\nSpecifically, me.\n\n\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\n\nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\n\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\n\nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\n\nAnd then, of course...\n\n\nThe human species?\n\n\nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\n\nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\n\nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\n\nHow about a suicide pact?\n\n\nHow do we do it?\n\n\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\n\nRight, right.\n\n\nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\n\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\n\nVanessa?\n\n\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\n\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\n\nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\n\nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\n\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\n\nI know. Me neither.\n\n\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\n\nWait a minute. Roses.

When people initially got introduced to VR around 5 years ago, almost every VR experience, whether it were on a PC or Mobile VR device, consisted of sitting in a chair and going through a rollercoaster ride. This resulted in motion sickness, discomfort, and a general stigma that VR wasn't worth much. Job Simulator undid that by offering an excellent standing experience where everything around you is interactive.

It was the first VR game Ive seen, so the first time I went to a VR arcade, I played this game. Ive played this game for HOURS before I bought an Oculus quest, so I was a little concerned that I wouldnt enjoy it as much. I was wrong. The game seems so small at first glance, but you will find that although there are few levels in this game (not including Infinite overtime, which makes the game endless) there is so much to do! To me, the reason why this might be the best VR game out there is because of how much things you can interact with! Lots of games just have items there laying around that you cant even pick up, but not Job Simulator. In Job Simulator, if you see something, you can pick it up and through it. The other really fun part about this game that I havent even mentioned yet is messing with the AI. The robots (that simulate people) are sooooooooo fun to mess with! Wether its stealing their hat, blending it, and serving them it in a smoothie, or if its just throwing something at them, messing with the AI makes this game so much more fun.

I barely get bored from playing, I always find myself playing for hours every time I open the game. I would explain how exactly how it this game is great by talking about CONTENT, and EVERYTHING ELSE.\n\n\nCONTENT: In the game you can do 4 jobs, Office Worker, Cooking, Supermarket Cashier, and Auto Mechanic. These jobs have one thing in-common, you grab/pull an object to get a job to do from a bot. You do that job until its done, then move on to the next. Even if that doesnt sound like much each job you get is ether something normal like printing a document or make a cup of tea, but you also get robbed or to remove lemons from a car made out of lemons, you never know what is going to happen. You can do so much in each job, I also like throwing stuff around and also seeing what objects do with a action. These jobs however do come to an end, after 20 or 30 assignments to complete the job. However you can just replay the job, but there is a mode called Infinite Overtime (Ill call it IO). In IO you go to work at night and will do it to end of time, there is a assignment counter counting every assignment you can complete. There is still more, after completing all 4 jobs you unlock Mods. First of all no there not community mods, there chips that changes physics of the world. However there are only two mods, one that makes low gravity, and the other makes ever object more bounce. It makes the game more fun and interesting, but I would like it if their would be more mods like 5 or 6.\n\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE: The games is also great at everything else like graphics, audio, music, bugs, runtime, how it runs, and other. The graphics arent things that wont impress you that much or at all, but it is still good. Audio is also good but not impressive at all, audio is audio. There is barely any music but you may find a radio the plays music in the jobs and it fine. Of course theres bugs, its a VR game so there is some but nothing you will notice at all. The game is short, you can complete by clearing your entire day. The game runs great and clear, so thats good I guess. And the price, the price is fine, no complaints.\n\nOverall this game is really fun and I do recommend this game to anyone who has a VR headset.\n\nI give it 5 Stars\n\nP.S. sorry if this review is really long\n\nHelpful | 5", "Elgaming7Jul 6 at 11:30 PM\nA super Good game\n\nThis game is one of the best vr games i ever played on oculus!!\n\nHelpful | 1", "HunterK215Jul 2 at 10:49 PM\nAmazing game\n\nIt is so fun and I like how you can and mess up stuff sometimes its really funny\n\nHelpful | 0", "MarzybrooksMar 8 at 5:43 PM\nSuper fun everlasting game\n\nAt first I didnt think it was good but after watching a few youtubers and getting the game I got hooked it is a must have on quest I highly recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Teddy.ShervheimFeb 10 at 7:04 PM\nVR is not complete without this game!\n\nWith great fun and interaction on literary every object there are so many things that get me to think and come back later to see if I can do and of course I can like making soup soup and soup soup its a great game so try it for yourself with anything that you try to working its so much fun and VR is not complete without this incredibly amazing game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Brogamer16Feb 15 at 1:45 AM\nWow this was amazing\n\nThis game is so fun it is literally the most fun you will ever have at work my favourite one was office worker because you could mess around with the computer and even go on a game website which prints of games for your virtual pc also I do like the way the bandit shows up in the office the store and the mechanics all of the games are fun love it definitely saving for vacation simulator\n\nHelpful | 0", "ShibashroomFeb 6 at 9:48 AM\nCouldnt stop laughing!\n\nThis was my second game on the quest and it was just amazing.

Job sim and a zombie game. For something of a long time Ive used my quest primarily for utility purposes being virtual desktop and Netflix. However after deciding to try a game I ended up buying this and I was pleasantly surprised. For someone that loves on rails shooters in VR this game entertained me still. The jokes hadnt really landed with me personally but I can see the potential in them. Overall I like the different positions you can play and the experiences to be had. The infinite overtime mode is perfect as it means that after experiencing what the base game has to offer I can enter this mode to continue. This extends its longevity. If you like more grounded experiences that arent complex yet comprehensive I highly recommend however its not for everyone. I gave it four stars as I felt that although the game was extensive it still didnt provide many different elements to diversify its gameplay loop. Its stellar for its price but anymore would be pushing it a little.\n\nHelpful | 0", "coolcoolclaudia3May 8 at 2:41 PM\nNice\n\nVery nice.\n\nHelpful | 0", "AreYouEvenRealDec 23 at 8:23 PM\nI love it\n\nI got the game and it did not disappoint I love it so much\n\nHelpful | 0", "zefferyNov 14 at 9:31 PM\nGreat Family Game!!\n\nMy girlfriend, her little brother, and my little sister all love this game.

Here's some more info on how to set up: https://support.oculus.com/guardian/ You may want to reset to resolve this.

When you start the game, you are a human in the year 2050 where the world is mostly run by job-obsessed robots. You start in a job museum where you get to choose from four different game cartridges, office worker, chef, gas station clerk, and mechanic. The office worker, my favorite, has donuts, coffee, and a computer you can put discs into and play games like flappy bot (flappy bird) and another Zork-style game. You also have a copying machine (try to copy your hand, it's hilarious). As a chef, you have access to a auto-refilling pantry and fridge, along with a radioactive microwave. Your job is to serve customers the food they want. As the mechanic, cars will come in and need repairs or upgrades on their vehicles. You also have access to four radio stations, including the one and only Car Talk radio, station 110.010101. The gas station clerk is like a simulated version of a Walmart worker, where you can fill up slushies, make hot dogs, consume both, and even clean the store. The game also has an infinite overtime mode, where you can do any of the jobs for as long as you want, however, the orders do get repetitive. This was the first game I bought on my quest, and though it was fun to watch others play and play it myself, it did eventually get boring. However, for $20, it was worth it.

There is no quality control of your tasks so if you do your sandwich with all the staff you can find in the kitchen the customer will be glad to receive it. At the beginning its fun as gameplay but at the end not really.\n\nI think that developers can add a competitive mode. It could be funnier if in this mode we have a timer for each task and you have to do the task exactly how customer asked for (like for sandwich put some cheese tomato and meat and not just random stuff you find in the kitchen like now). Also its better if this mode is endless that means it become harder with less time and more difficult tasks.
