Gymnasia used to do that but now I noticed it's been changed to coming soon. Also the LeBron James, and Through the Ages apps have been \"coming soon\" for at least a couple of months now.\n\nEdit: July 31 - Now attempting to launch the app causes my Oculus Quest to freeze after getting an error that does not respond to my acknowledging the error by selecting \"ok\".

I think it's great that they will be grouping them together and making them accessible from a single location in the Quest library, even if they are not all available yet. When the Cirque du Soleil creations are available to the Quest (currently it's greyed-out in the menu selection) my score goes to 5 stars. :)\n\nETA: Cirque du Soleil is now available and the Felix & Paul app has been updated to link to it. You do need to pay for it separately but it is worth it. My score goes to 5 stars as promised. :)\n\nHelpful | 2", "calforbMay 8 at 12:58 PM\nAmazing! Astounding VR experience\n\nWhen this released there were issues with some of the files but they appear to have fixed it very quickly because today its working fine.\n\nIts great to see highly polished VR content on the Quest. since having the Quest from launch I know the library of VR content has expanded so much in offering and quality.\n\nI have only tried Jurassic Park (download the files because the quality is amazing - streaming is ok but nowhere near the same definition) and I can say it was an amazing experience. The video with blue the velociraptor is spectacular! To get that close into a scene and experience a Jurassic Park scene is just amazing. I cant wait to see what VR experiences we will see in the future with even higher quality visuals and feature length.\n\nDefinitely experience these! They highlight some of the best film done in full VR I think; and while theres only a few to choose from now I think the others are definitely on my wish list to see. Plus they are free so its bonus content on the quest for nothing!\n\nHelpful | 17", "Majestic76May 7 at 1:48 PM\nGymnasia\n\nI tried to watch Gymnasia but wouldn't play hopfully it works soon.
