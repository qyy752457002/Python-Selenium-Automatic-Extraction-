The first game I ever bought for my quest was Beat Saber, followed by Superhot. I had been eyeing Sairento since first opening the Oculus store but Superhot was more well known and I had played the demo before so I knew exactly what I was getting.\n\nBig Mistake.\n\nThis game is leagues and levels beyond Superhot. The locomotion is so intuitive and smooth. It took a few missions to really figure out the controls but once I did, holy ninja stars! Running, sliding, triple jumping off walls, doing a slow motion flip, shooting upside down for 2 kills and landing with your katana in another enemies neck. Its truly feels as awesome as it sounds.\n\nThe game has plenty of weapons to try out and keep things fresh. Graphics are on par with most other VR games. There seems to be plenty of content to keep playing for awhile (if being a ninja is reason enough).\n\nIf I had to complain about something I would say the mission structure isnt exactly intuitive. You pick from 3 randomly generated missions or a map screen that randomly has missions pop up. I expected a campaign of sorts which the game doesnt seem to have. This is a minor complaint though as all the missions pretty much just involve Go be a ninja. Kill the bad guys. Do it with style\n\nThis game is great fun, truly the best VR game Ive ever played. Hats off to the devs.\n\nHelpful | 66\nDeveloper ResponseJun 29 at 11:35 PM\n\nThank you so much for giving us your support and kind words!

You can practice go to endless mode go online or do missions. They could add in somethings that would make the game better like I wish you could unlock more special attacks for swords it only has that chakra slash they should add in more stuff like that. They could touch up the graphics a bit. In my own opinion I think they should make the gore better or make it so if you cut the with a sword and cut where there head is the head will come of not just half the body.

I did notice a few issues. Leveling up takes so long, or im just bad at getting experience, audio tends to be weird with some weapons.

Quite fun solo experience even if the AI is a tad lacking in my opinion. Glad theyre adding more multiplayer and I certainly hope to see more in the future.\n\nWould love to just generally see more game modes or game types as well. DLCshave been quite nice so far as well, thumbs up.\n\nAs for the minor gripe after having to replace my headset losing all of my progress due to lack of a cloud save kind of was a bit irritating. However you can manually copy the files over if you know which ones and the developers even offered to help out if they were lost completely. So definitely kudos to them for that response.\n\nThankfully I was able to restore my progress but Definitely need a cloud save as do many of the games on the storefront but the online ones in particular.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response3 days ago\n\nThank you so much for giving us your support!

Sure, the graphics aren't the greatest but I've seen a lot worse. Definitely not distracting.\n\nI think the main strength of this game is its insanely wide range of diverse playability. I've got my VR legs so I don't get motion sick easily, but there are tons of options for those who do, as well as being able to fine-tune every little aspect about everything in the game. I spent like an hour just playing with different settings in the dojo. I'm also ambidextrous, and FINALLY, a game that supports switching hands naturally!!! Just toss a weapon from one hand to the other! However the menus only respond to selected dominant hand rather than either one like most games, which is weird. Overall, I'm personally a power-user so I like to explore and learn to utilize every ability and feature a game has to offer, and this will keep me going for some time as there is a LOT to learn and practice. That being said, one could have lots of fun and do well only using a few moves and weapons - hence the wide range of playability.\n\nEDIT: after getting a bit more comfortable with it, it's becoming very obvious that I need a much bigger play space to make the most out of this game. Right now I play in my small bedroom, and I must've smashed my hand on various things a dozen times in one session. Nothing wrong with the game, but beware if you also have a small space!\n\nComing from Space Pirate Trainer, I think Sairento has a much better execution of mechanics on reaching behind you to grab a weapon; I almost never need to try twice to get what I want whereas in SPT it's so unreliable it's quite distracting. Plus, this has 3 more places to grab for a total of 5, and it's still nearly flawless.\n\nHats off to the devs not only for the game but for being so responsive in the reviews. I hear they're kinda finished with this but just in case I have two suggestions so far, 1) I like to use sticky grip turned off, but doing so disables using grip to flip the direction of swords/knives. Might it be possible to have an adjustable delay so if you release and quickly press again it flips the direction without letting go? 2) My weapon of choice whenever possible is a bo staff; seems like it'd be a pretty fitting addition to a ninja game!\n\nOverall loving this so far. Well worth the purchase.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper Response20 days ago\n\nThank you so much for writing up such a wonderful review! We are so glad you enjoyed the cyber-ninja experience!

The weapons are all fantastic, I love the use of swords, ninja stars, and even rocket launchers and crossbows. Theres a backflip feature which I think is really awesome! You can mix it up by dual wielding and even reverse gripping some swords! The slide mechanic is unique and one that I enjoy very much. The wall running is so awesome to use, especially in succession or when there are tons of enemies to shoot.

I can easily run through a full charge on the headset and wish the battery lasted longer! There is such a variety of weapons that I have multiple loadouts that work completely different from each other.\nJumping up in the air, doing a backflip in slow motion, and landing with a ground pound is so much fun and can only be experienced in VR. It looks great, from the futuristic cities to the ability to change accents of color on the weapons.\nI have to mention a few things that could be problems. The controls are the most advanced I've seen on the Quest. Once you get the hang of it they're perfect but it took some practice for me. There can be some motion sickness issues. The first time I did a backflip it was disorienting and nauseating, but I adjusted to it quickly.\nLastly, after the tutorial they kind of just throw you in. You have to figure out how to do things on your own. It took me forever to find the shop and when I did I accidentally sold ALL my weapon and armor mods by clicking on the wrong thing. There is a learning curve.\nOverall it is one of my favorite games on the Quest and I highly recommend it for anyone looking to feel like a true ninja.\n\nHelpful | 12\nDeveloper ResponseJun 16 at 8:38 PM\n\nThank you so much for giving ur your support as well as taking the time to write such a long review!

Takes a few missions to get the hang of it, but after that you are looking to expand your arsenal of ninja moves. Great for getting the VR experience. It can get pretty immersive. The 2 main complaints I have, are:\n\n1. No story mode or anything close. Choosing missions is like the Xbox game Payday. Several missions pop up on individual timers, each with varying tasks/goals and difficulties. Super random, and you can also further adjust the difficulty and add map modifiers.\n\n2. They explain the controls in the tutorial, but nothing else. So as you're playing, you are gaining loot and relics and beacons or whatever, and basically a bunch of stuff, and its up to you to figure out how everything works and where it goes.\n\nOtherwise, make sure you have actually space around you when you play, cuz I get so into it, I actually punch stuff around me.

The gameplay is amazing with flips, bullet time, tons of weapons, a customizable armory and even multiplayer co-op. I've never had the game crash, and if you're a VR veteran like me with your VR legs, doing flips won't make you puke. The only downsides to this game that I can think of as of now, are that there aren't really many online players on. Usually 0 or 2 most of the time so you will want to have a friend that also owns the game too if you want to play co-op. Also the graphics defiantly aren't the best if I'm being completely honest but it never bugged me too much. Most environments still look nice and fit the overall aesthetic even without much lighting.\n\nOverall, while the graphics aren't the best and there aren't many online players, there's still incredible gameplay, customization and tons of content in this game and I think you're really missing out on this if you don't already own it.\nGG devs\n\nEdit: If you're having trouble looking for players, there's a discord server with an active community which you could ask to play with other people on.

I can't imagine how to play this game with a wire.\nThe locomotion movement freedom gives the player nearly unlimted capabilities inside Sairento. Walking along the walls, sliding around and jumping in any possible way.\nThat mean, in reality, a bit space is needed. Turning around multiple times, going into the knees to simulate the sliding and move around.\nLike I said, no clue how this is playable with a wire.\nThis is a absolutely crazy VR game where dual wielding weapons as Katanas, guns, uzis and mixing it up dominates the play.\n\nHowever besides that load of non stop action, there isn't really a story or tons of motivation for me personally.\n\nHowever, it's a bada.. experience that brings me close to repaint my apartment with my vomit.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response15 days ago\n\nThank you so much for giving us your support!

Your avatar double jumps, flips, slides and runs along walls. Not for the VR sick. It's also fairly straight-forward: A bunch of baddies spawn in an arena and you bounce around trying to kill them with the many toys you get to kill people with. A story mode, or anything actually tying the gameplay together (like Robo Recall does very well) would have made this a 5 star experience. But if you feel like bouncing around and killing things with a sword, this is the best Quest experience I have found so far.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 18 at 8:37 AM\n\nThank you so much for giving us your support!

For what there is to do its fun to do. This is definitely an action game that requires vr sea legs to some degree. I certainly wouldnt make this the first game I played in Quest. Start off with bait them move to mission:ISS then come play this game. The graphics are early Xbox 360ish but the game play is intense and makes you feel like a right bad a**! If being a ninja and fast paced action are your jam then buy this game now. If you want stealth action this isnt for you.\n\nReview update: The more I play it the more I like it. My only complaint is what are the names of the different characters? I know which one is a sumo but other wise I havent a clue what Im suppose to be killing for the challenge. Id recommend adding a glossary of enemies so we can know which is which.\nI call them Sumo, ninja with a gun, samurai, ninja lady, geisha, drone gun, and boss samurai is really like to know their real names though.\n\nUpdate2: the dev added a encyclopedia of enemies so my one complaint no longer exists.

However, first time in I spent several hours and never got motion sick!\n\nI spent a long time with just the basic loadout they give you (two katanas, two pistols, one automatic) before figuring out i could also equip rifles, shotguns, a bow, and throwing weapons.\n\nThe bow is probably my favorite weapon so far but they are all fun (honestly haven't tried them all yet). The sheer amount of weapons give this game a lot of replayability, even though it is the same 5 maps all the time.\n\nThe maps are great btw, and its so fun to hop around, do flips, wall runs, and slides. Its the first game with a teleport mechanic that i haven't hated.\n\nIf you want to hop around and shoot things with a ton of movement options, this is a good pickup.

Either way it is an amazing game and I only crashed once, maybe its because it was a new game cause I tried it out again and it was fine. This game is highly recommended to anyone reading the review who hasnt bought it yet but who wouldnt buy it? Well people that have different tastes and motion sickness which would make this game very uncomfortable as it says on the comfort level scale thing. I only want to know how to flip so then I dont have to aim down with my guns and accidentally reload because that seems to be a slight issue when you dont know how to flip and I really dont care if the flips are on quest or not its just the hands on the quest seem like they could be improved for better online communication if one person doesnt have a mic when playing online. This game is still great despite all its flaws with online and it not doing the greatest with the hand design but being honest its better than having a blob for hands like in a small amount of games or just no hands at all but amazing game and it looked up my my expectations I call this game epic\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 20 at 9:28 PM\n\nThank you so much for writing such a long review!

The Quest is my first VR experience, so I didnt exactly have my VR legs at the beginning.\n\nBoy am I glad I waited a while to get this game.

Just now I was playing Nightmare endless with +100% enemy health, and I was rocking it! I was over 30 minutes in, gathering every single drop and having an awesome game when the game crashed! I was sent back to home screen and the app was closed. I lost all that XP, credits, and pickups. That just really kills my joy of wanting to play.\n\nI was looking for a new game and I came across this one. I was hesitant because the previews didnt look to be all that good. But just playing for a couple hours I have really enjoyed it. Its definitely not an easy game to master and requires a lot of trial and error to get comfortable with it. I am still trying to try different settings to get to where I can get it to do what I want but its been a really fun experience. Even with the flips, wall climbs, flashes-dashes-and crashes its not overly stimulating to where you lose visual control. The gameplay is fun and as I level up and obtain more items I foresee this being a top favorite game.\n\nIf you get overly stimulated or motion sickness this is NOT the game for you. The developers note of comfort level Intense is very accurate.\n\nThe price point was a little steep, I sadly missed the sale by an hour so I was a little bitter with myself, but if you are looking for a good 1st person shooter/sword fighting action game look no further.\n\nIt has a few bugs still but it looks like they have been updating it.

I've had this game since it's release and it had it's fair share of updates; I could definitely say it looks alot better than when it first released. Unfortunately, the graphics still needs work and it's too distracting to be immersed in the gameplay. From booting up the game and seeing my low poly'd, low textured hands, it reminds me of how the experience is visually through out. On the other hand, the gameplay's great, no other title does it like this one. You have complete freedom of movement, that being from jumping off walls, doing backflips and sliding using momentum, it's all there.

After the one year anniversary sale I decided to pick it back up because of the discount. And after playing it I've gotta give respect where it's due. I understand with the quest that graphics aren't gonna be mind blowing, but based on videos it looked unplayable to me, but actually putting it on the headset the graphics aren't half bad. Gameplay is pretty fun and I'm still getting used to it so the challenge is there. Reading a different reviewers post, I found out that this is an indie game and that made me like it even more.

I really love the games that allow you to pull the bow back with one hand and hold it with the other, but this is just a fraction of the excitement I get from this game. I currently have two swords on my hips, a bow on my left shoulder, a pistol on my right shoulder, and a really cool SMG that shoots until it needs to cool down on my lower back. I really love how you can do flips, its really intense playing this game standing up or sitting in a chair that spins. The slow mo is cool, but you can even just normal play it and not hold the jump button to go into slow motion. Really like the graphics to this game and how each enemy is special in their own way. The way the game is set up, there is no story mode that will be over and making you wish you had more of the game to play, because you just play more operations that fit into the level you are currently at in the game. You are also able to level up your weapons and armor and spend skill points to make your equipment and experience better.

It feels awesome to flip upside down slow motion and buck at the bad guys with 2 pistols. Also satisfying is teleporting right up to them and misting them with the shotgun.

It has so many weapons that function pretty well except for throwable weapons as they're kind of inconsistent.\n\nThe game has so many option settings; it makes me laugh at other games because these guys are indie developers.\n\nMake sure to fiddle with the settings like adjusting your height to trigger slides, activating backflips, and reverse gripping melee weapons.\n\nThe graphics gives you a PS2 feeling which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Though they did encounter problems of one of their original artist copying code from previous works put into their games, they had to let that person go but they still continued to upgrade the game. They've redone textures for many maps because of user feedback which is great because they have won our hearts, are trying, and are listening to us. Also from listening, they've given the players new maps, weapons, co-op, and bug fixes.\n\nEven if the graphics were toned down for the Quest, the combat makes up more than enough for the game. Like you can wall climb, wall run, slide, stick on walls, do backflips, summersault, and you can do all these acrobatic movements in slow mo like its the Matrix.\n\nOk, so the settings are cyberpunk themed. So expect locations that look like you're in the Matrix, in the Ghost in the Shell universe, and/or in Neotokyo.\n\nThere really isn't a lot of lore for this game as in the Untethered version its mostly arcady with only missions/operations. So there is no story mode unless there is? Idk.\n\nThis game will make you sweat, just saying. You will also get dizzy from backflipping but it will become second nature to you in the long run. But at least you won't get tangled by wires.\n\nYou can't really see your body other than your hands.\n\n\nThe game starts you off in a tutorial and you can practice in a dojo that will also acts as your home menu to select and customize.\n\nThe main menu also provides you with the oldest to the latest patch note on the game.\n\nThe game so far has 3 DLC packs and each contain 1 new map, and 1 new weapon. They are pretty cheap and I would buy them for the maps because base game maps become repetitive even though they were built new from the ground up and not maps from the original version of Sairento VR.\n\nThe developers actually put up events like sales and double exp/loot rates.\n\nAll in all, it was worth the price and experience thanks to the developers who continuously put effort into improving the game.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 19 at 4:59 AM\n\nWe would really like to thank you for writing up such a wonderful review for us!

The gameplay is immersive and so much fun. I have put more hours in this game then any other quest title. Easy to jump in and out. The action in this game is the best I have experienced so far when it comes to shooters on the quest. I heard that multiplayer was non existent in this game but the times I have played multiplayer I had no issues finding people to play with. Couple of things I would have liked would have been a campaign mode with a light story and a stronger progression system. Its really cool that majority of weapons are available to you right from the beginning, but having a stronger progression system with things you can unlock and actually feel like you are getting stronger and more powerful would have been great. Also a wider variety of stages would make this game perfect. I know the hardware is limited on quest, so what the devs have done here is amazing!

But, you known how it goes... So here is my first review and recommendations.\nThis game is above anything else on the Quest when it comes to the ways you can move and customize to your style. This should become the standards for every game to come, as to simply move around. If i would compare it to a movie, you can do the same moves and as much carnage as that little River in Serinity /Firefly. With your bare hands or a very nice variety of weapons. That slow motion movement that works in a 2 player game is the cherry on top.\nFor my recommendations I would say it definitely needs to be able to me more than 2 for multiplayer. I understand the limitations of the Quest makes it difficult, but I think the players would accept less enemies, harder to kill, and the visual downgrade. That is of course the longer term project, but in my opinion, a quick fix that would improve the multiplayer, would be the ability to be more people in the dojo, where you can still show off your moves, have voice chat and from there, be able to start a game with one of the guys in there.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 28 at 8:31 PM\n\nThank you so much for your kind words and support!

Have you ever wanted to experience Neo from Matrix bullet dodging scene? Have you ever wanted to punch a giant Sumo to death with your barehands? Perform triple jumps? Run through the walls?\nWell then, get this game, this is the most fast paced experience you will find in the Oculus store, diverse set of weapons of your choice, swords, guns, kunais, bow, there are way too many to list them all. Buy this if you came to virtual reality looking for ACTION and ADRENALINE\n\nNow for the devs:\n1.-There is two things I would really appreciate being added to the game which both involve the barehand fighting feature.\nFirst, sometimes when you get closer to an enemy you get so close that you go inside his body, making the experience a little unpleasant as you can still kill the enemies without seeing them. I think the thumbsticks should be able to be used to walk for two reasons: Stealth kills and to be able to walk just a few steps to position yourself correctly.\n\n2.- I really enjoy playing the game with the barehands mastery, so you must know where my question is going. Is it too hard to have a handtracking mode to leave the controls aside and just enjoy using our own hands for the experience? I think this would greatly improve the immersion, as the only neccesary additional movements would be jumps and acceleration, which I would say aren't too hard to assign a command movement like you did with the flips where you lift your hands to make it work and the slower fall extending your hands to the sides.\n\nStill though, the game as it is is incredible, and increasing the immersion with something like this would totally add a lot of potential buyers.

There is an almost mobile game quality of daily mission-style quests to grind for rewards. This makes the game easy to drop in for a short bit of play, but also allows for grinding to deck out your character. I ran into a few small glitches with a last enemy in a stage not spawning, but this was rare, and overall the game runs well. Id say my main issue that brings this title to 4 stars, is that sometimes the hit boxes of enemies dont seem to properly register melee attacks.

This went on sale recently and I decided to give it a shot since I LOVE dismemberment, slow motion, parkour, load outs, customization, and dual wielding. Yeah this game has all of those. I was a little nervous because the last INTENSE comfort game that I played was Rush and it made me really motion sick so I didnt know how this one would go. After getting used to the game and parkour with the vision reducer on, I decided to turn it off for a better viewing experience and I get no nausea at all. Sometimes I feel a little wierd trying to nail shots in a backflip by twisting over in real life but NO NAUSEA. I immediately fell in love with the game and even though I was disappointed to find that it had dlc, they were very reasonably priced and well worth it. One pack was pretty much worth the price of all 3 especially because of the map that each pack adds as well as 1 new weapon per pack that are all pretty good.\n\nFor the devs: As someone else said before it would be cool if we could get full body animations but that is not at all a deal breaker. What I would love to see though would be the ability to wall run upwards and then flip off instead of just bouncing off and it would also allow smoother vertical climbing for maps like the suburbs or slums. Speaking of climbing it would be nice to hang on things with your arms but again totally understand. I think the graphics are great but upgrades are always appreciated. A grappling hook could maybe be cool as well as just more weapon choices in general possibly unlock-able ones. Maybe a campaign but then again I love the never ending-ness to the current level selection. One last thing, if you could make it so that more weapons could fit on the lower holsters that would be great, especially weapons like the disintegrater because its small as well as the glaive and maybe even the other things, idk but those especially. I would also like the opportunity to be able to dual wield a weapon like a shotgun or rifle similar to the smgs. Also I thought that I saw in the trailer that the bow had multiple shots maybe and so I was just wondering about that and maybe different arrow types similar to the Armageddon shotgun. Sorry I had a lot to request but just wanted to provide my feedback. Great job with the game devs, keep up the good work, I will totally buy more dlc if it stays so nicely priced.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 22 at 1:32 AM\n\nThank you so much for writing us such a long and kind review! We are so glad you liked Sairento and we really appreciate it! The reason why we did not add in full body animations because it had a pretty huge impact on the FPS performance where we had no choice but to remove it. The idea about running vertically up the wall and doing a backflip sounds pretty dope! We will keep this in mind for our next game! Your suggestions are really cool and we would love to have them in our next game such as the hookshots too. About the campaign, there is the story mode in the PC version of the game, however we have no plans to port it over as it would be a major undertaking porting over all the original levels. For the Bow, We do have different ammo types such as homing and explosive arrows. Lastly we would like to tell you that we are moving on to creating another new game with the lessons that we have learnt from Sairento. Thank you once again for such a splendid write up of the game! :)", "LightfallsJan 19 at 5:23 AM\nI own on Steam and a must on Quest!\n\nAfter viewing a lot of reviews I finally bought the game and sincerely impressed me, untethered, that's the main factor here, the graphics?

At first it takes a second to get used to the controls but once you do, boy is it AWESOME! Also, I'd recommend standing to play this one. Tried sitting and playing but I do so much better standing up, where I am able to turn my body on a whim. Sure you can use the sticks but physically turning is, A. So much more immersive and B. MUCH quicker. I only wish the Co OP and Multiplayer modes where a bit easier to find a server or match on. I'm sure that will be patched in the future though. Bravo to the development team!

The only thing I would recommend is that when I go to missions, the rendering takes some time and takes me out of it. Also for some reason my sliding stopped working and I didnt change any settings. But this game is so good with some great environments and mechanics.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMar 25 at 9:03 PM\n\nThank you so much for your 5 stars and support! We are not able to change the loading and rendering part of the game as it is necessary for the game to run properly. For the sliding mechanic, could it be that your tracking is off? Our Slide mechanic works with height of the player so it might not work if the tracking is off. We do have a solution for this under Options > Accessibility > Set Slide Height. If the Slide mechanic is still not functioning properly after that please send us your saved data to support@mixedrealms.com and we will try figure out what is wrong. :)", "sidboiApr 5 at 7:12 PM\nMy favorite VR game... keeps crashing...\n\nI love this game so so much but theres a consistent issue with the game crashing, it happens all the time and its really annoying.

I have had some fun with Pistol Whip as its quick and I can get in and out on breaks.\n\nWhen I first tried this game(even on pc) I was like teleport. omg... NO... and I mostly did not play. But then it came on Quest and I was like lets try again.\n\nMAN, its so fun once you get used to the mechanics. Also the flip option .. OMG I am John Wick.... This game is super fun and a crazy amount of options and weapons and power ups. I honestly have not got through all the weapons and options even yet. They really took something very simple and added 1000's of options and ways to play..\n\nSo .. looking for something you can throw on, feel like a bad ninja and then go off and come back later.. This is it, yes its simple graphics, and from what I have seen about 6-8 enviroments.. But man.. Once you get used to the mechanics here you have alot of fun.\n\nYou can shoot, slice, slide, bounce off walls and flip(in settings so fun) ..

It easily fills that gap between a melee game and a shooter game, without sacrificing a lot in either aspect to create a merged experience.\n\nAnd that's not even counting the acrobatics, bullet time, and entirely optional yet very effective stealth play.\n\nThere are some aspects I'd like to see included, of course. More interactive gun reloads or melee weapon momentum would be a nice addition. Yet the flow of the game is so mind bendingly fun that you hardly notice these things anyway, so i really must still award 5 stars for a job done awesomely well!\n\nElaboration on momentum:\nSome of the games ive played that feature melee reward maximum damage depending on the swing of the weapon. Harder swings, stabbing motions, or even using the appropriate edge of a single bladed sword coukd drastically change the damage output.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMar 2 at 7:26 PM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars and support!

Its my absolute favorite.\nI was stuck between Elven Assassin and Sairento, and I picked Sairento, with no regrets.\nIve read a lot of reviews saying the graphics arent great, but to me theyre excellent. There are also so many settings to change, like if you want to see blood or not.\nThe mobility in this game is amazing. You can to flips, backflips, jumps, and all crazy kind of things. Ive spent a long time getting used to my vr legs, so it doesnt put me off, but if you get motion sickness easily then maybe stay away from flips for now.\nTheres a big range of different weapons, like close range guns, snipers, swords, and even throwing weapons. I think you can imagine what a backflip, time slow and an op gun would do.\nWhen it comes picking missions, you have a huge variety to pick from. And then theres an infinite mode where you fight till you die, so theres no way you can get bored of the game.\n\nI think one thing that would improve the game is having a tutorial on how to navigate through missions and what they do, and how to use items you receive from completing them. When I first got the game I flew through the tutorial for movement and fighting, but getting used to picking missions was a bit hard, but only a minor setback.\n\nSo if youre considering this game, just get it. Its amazing :))\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 23 at 6:54 PM\n\nThank you so much for picking Sairento and spending your time to write such a long review for us!

My reasoning behind this statement is that all the Reviews are blaring about Amazing Graphics and awesome combat! But In reality, The game has blocky graphics, Hit-and-Run combat, and the dismemberment feature is very off. Also, I think that the game disables the Guardian Barrier because I slammed my Hand into my wall and cracked the controllers ring! And where was the Guardian Barrier?! Nowhere to be seen!\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseApr 11 at 8:06 PM\n\nWe are so sorry that you did not manage to have fun with our game. 1) Regarding the Hit-and-Run combat, we do promote ourselves as a more arcadey kind of game which unlike the other games out there which offers a more fleshed out combat physics system. 2) Because Sairento is fast paced and there are many things happening on the screen at any 1 time which takes up a lot of processing power. We had to lower down the dismemberment quality to sustain the FPS. 3) We are so sorry that your controller has cracked. Our game does not disable the Guardian Barrier. We hope that you can give our game another chance, there are many relics you can collect and legendary once changes the style of which you use your weapons.

I knew controls decently well as I had played vive before. For someone who maybe just got the quest and hasnt played VR I would recommend trying a different game first. This game is sort of disorienting though there are comfort controls. After playing for maybe 20 minutes I felt as though I had sucked the game dry. There is little to do and a small player base. If you have the money to spend I would recommend this game as an occasional play and to show other people just what the quest can do movement wise. Aside from this if you do not have the most money to throw around and only can get a couple game I wouldnt recommend this being one of them. It is fun, but maybe not 15 dollars worth of fun.

Will update...so far I highly recommend, especially if Vacation Simulator was a little too boring for you also ;-)\nEdit: The only reason I lowered this to 4 stars is the lack of Campaign or motivation to keep playing. There are weapon upgrades and some daily goals, but they aren't enough to make me want to grind in the same few arenas over and over. Buying the new environments can only do so much since they are all pretty similar. Any type of campaign would do wonders for this game. It might at least get players hooked into the grind and open the first few weapon upgrades so they will want more. As it is, it could take quite a while to upgrade weapons into the second tier. Still a fun game with fun locomotion, just needs more.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 13 at 7:30 PM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars and support!

The amount of weapons is astounding, the movement is fluent and the game doesn't force you to do flips or slide which would cause motion sickness, it's completely optional. If you don't get motion sick easily try the flips and slides, they are tons of fun. The only minuses (in my humble opinion) are that, theres a lot of motion so motion sickness kicks in easily and there's no campaign (which i understand becouse quest is probably not strong enough). This is just my opinion but i think you should at LEAST give this game a try. Also do some streching before playing i did the misteke of not, and now my muscles are almost cramping. Thank you for reading my review, and have a wonderful day.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 24 at 8:20 PM\n\nThank you so much for your kind review!

We barely get any backstory on the character and the world around us, we only really get to see the small handful of maps given to us, an open world sort of vibe would make it a way more enjoyable experience. Also just a suggestion but adding a place to train with new weapons you want to use would be great, and I'm not just talking about the little dojo we spawn in, I mean a full on training room, along with that, maybe you could add some new weapons, and maybe some more weapon slots(you could make a relic to do that.)

The Devs care about this game and it really shows.\nAfter some time away from VR in general, returning to games like this, and seeing new content , or small things such as how many games had a holiday theme going on during the Holidays. At first i thought the game was over complicated in the way where you learn a lot, and need to keep that retained or you won't be good.\n\nBut it thankfully not like this, its more like riding a bike you never forget. The game can be as simplistic, or hard as you want and has limitless replayability if you enjoy it. There's a lot of content here and the devs, like i said seem to be great.

Sairento might not technically be the best game of the bunch, but it is outright some of the most fun Ive had in VR.\n\nFirst of all, youre gonna need some floor space, a strong stomach and a bit of patience initially to get into it. Once you learn how to chain jumps together, run along walls, front or backflip, slide along the floor and twist your body around during slo-mo airtime - you will be able to fully embody your greatest cyberninja fantasy.\n\nOnce that gameplay clicks, you are awarded with a tremendous amount of creative potential in how you approach your enemies and link your silky moves together. This mixed with the vast array of weapon types mean that you can develop multiple different gameplay styles and even switch them up mid-fight. Its gloriously satisfying and addictive.\n\nTheres no real campaign or story pulling it together but instead a constant grind of loot and resources - that I actually think makes it great for dipping into for short or long sessions. Theres an array of interesting arenas and challenges to test you with but youre always just aiming to kill multiple waves of enemies in every game.

Even more fun untethered. Tons of missions, play with friends in co-op, slice dice and shoot your way to your inner ninja!\n\nWorth a buy for sure, but I do have a few issues that may influence your decisions!\n\n1. The entire game is not co-op, which is a little saddening. There is only one mode that has it (several objectives and maps/missions) instead of the whole game. My bro and I would love to be able to play the whole game together.\n\n2. When you do decide to play co-op, youll notice some lag issues. They are not game breaking, but they definitely hurt the immersion level. You just dont feel as fluid in coop which takes away from feeling like a smooth flowing assassin.\n\n3. This is probably my biggest for why its not a 5 star game: GRAPHICS. This game has pretty much the same setup at Robo-Recall (also for Quest; in terms of multiple set maps with hordes of enemies that attack you) yet the graphical resolution is definitely a step down from that, as well as several other titles that just look smoother. Feels like the game should have had a graphics/textures update at this point, and really it looks the same as it did on my PSVR almost 2 years ago when I got this. If it looked a little cleaner, and that clean, smooth look continued to work well in multiplayer, this would be the greatest game on the Quest to date!\n\nThanks to the devs for all the hard work I know goes into this, hope my humblest of opinions helps!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJan 30 at 8:02 PM\n\nThank you so much for your valuable feedback!

(Update1/29/20)\n\nUpdate 1/29/2020\nGame has become very stale. Just constantly jumping around. Enemies dont feel like enemies they feel like targets. No sign of multiplayer ever working correctly and smoothly. And updates and additions have slowed down dramatically since release.\n\n\n\n(OP)What an awesome game!! Such versatility to play any way you want to play! Multiple maps that constantly give me anxiety (good anxiety), multiple weapons, multiple difficulties, you can make it anything you want!!! So awesome! I just wish there was some sort of multiplayer, wether it be Co-Op or PvP, even a 1v1 who can clear the enemies on the map first would be pretty slick. That would make movement and accuracy crucial. That would be fun. Cant wait to see what yall do in the future. Keep it up!!! \n\n*Update (12/20/19) Wow........just WOW! These devs are KILLING IT!!!! Constant updates! Free content! Amazing DLCs! They actually listen to the players of the game!! Easily the best game on the quest for the price! They could easily charge $29.99-$39.99 and i would still pay it! Just purely outstanding! Other developers should take notes!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJan 29 at 11:03 PM\n\nWe understand that the game has become very stale after awhile.

You equip yourself from the menu before heading off into battle.\n\nThe difference between Sairento and other wave shooters is the mobility. There is smooth locomotion mixed with double or triple jumps, wall running, backflips and sliding attacks. This is going to be a problem for those sensitive to motion sickness, as they won't be able to play the game as intended.\n\nAttacks cleave enemies into pieces, spraying limbs in the direction of your sword swing. Gunshots are meaty and headshots are satisfying.\n\nOnce you've cleared the mission, you can start equipping relics to power your armour and weapons. It's this progression system that will keep you playing, as relics have the ability to change how weapons and attacks work, leaving plenty of customisation options.\n\nMultiplayer is functional, but animations still need work. The fella I was playing with seemed to always be bent over and looking at the floor. Not many players at all, either.\n\nThere are only 10 small-sized maps, which can get a bit repetitive. A few more would really help the variety. A few extra enemy types and weapons would also get this another star.\n\nStill, this is one of the most fun, replayable experiences on the Quest and well worth the price compared to similar experiences. Must have - if you have your sea legs.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 1 at 9:14 AM\n\nThank you so much for the support!

This is an amazing game! I love the mechanics of the game and there is so much to do! I have a lot of games on my Quest, but this is by far the best I've played. I hope they keep supporting this game and keep updating it. Will definitely purchase the DLC packs after I'm done with the game. I do wish that they can package the DLC together with a cheaper price, but I suspect that there will be more DLC to come. Maybe when they are all done with releasing DLC, they will package it together. Great job you guys.\n\n\nOriginal review:\nI really want to enjoy this game... If the game lets me. I play the tutorial, it keeps crashing. It took me about 4 tries to finish the tutorial. It's really annoying when you want to just play the game. I gave up after the tutorial because it was a pain in the butt.

I'm not super prone to it, but even I got it a bit when I turned on terrestrial walking. Otherwise, this is the most replayable game on the quest currently, to me. Imagine Killing Floor, but instead of zombie themed it's ninja theme. It's got a wide array of weapons (Throwing, pistols, shotguns, rifles, bows!) and even the subtypes within those categories are differentiated. It's also the best melee game outside of beat saber! I just wish the samurai enemies would actually duel you instead of just being a flurry of slashes, but I'll take what I can get. No other game on VR has gotten me as close to my Warhammer-inspired fantasy of wielding a saber in one hand and a pistol in the other. I also love this game because it lets you fulfill all your middle-school ninja fantasies and see why they're so stupid, lol. Wielding a katana back-grip is SO ineffective (Just like all the history youtubers and ninja books I have say), but they let you try! Props to that!\n\nNote: I find the sliding mechanic extremely hard to use. I either turn it to full so I'm sliding every time I move, or fully off. I'm 6'3\" and 30 yrs old, my knees can't handle a deep crouch and I can't get it to activate ONLY on slight crouches. This is my only real, enjoyment-affecting complaint with sairento. That, and I can't figure out how to reliably make thrown weapons actually go where I'm throwing, but that might just be me. I might be putting too much faith in my real life experience of being a 14 yr old mall ninja with 3 sets of throwing daggers and a black t-shirt wrapped around my head...\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJan 3 at 11:44 PM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars and support! We are so glad that you enjoyed the game and experience so much! We do have comfort settings such as tunnel vision or faded teleport if you are still not used to the movement. You can try to adjust the slider again such that you just have to slightly bend your knees to get the slide working.

When I first started playing, I was pretty turned off by it tbh. The first few missions I played I didn't really enjoy or see the point. However, once I gave it a break and came back to it, I dug deeper into all the weapon combinations and movements that you can do in-game. I started playing around with these things and found myself having more fun than before. However, I still wasn't completely impressed with the game. Day after day I kept finding myself gravitating towards the application though. And over time I began to upgrade and make my weapons better and I also became very fluent at moving around the maps. This is now one of my favorite game on my Quest and I have absolutely 0 regrets about buying it, which it is placed at a great price btw. I am so glad I gave this game a chance and just didn't stop playing after first impressions. As for the graphics, they are not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be, plus the game has gotten lots of post-launch support. As for the motion sickness, this did bother me at first. After my first session I felt like I was going to throw-up but I never found motion sickness as a problem for me. I got used to it after about 3 sessions and I am completely new to vr and I didn't even use any of the comfort options that are available if motion sickness is an issue for you.

I have five jumps now and it is amazing to fly through the air and bullet time arrow shoot enemies.\nThe recent update to the Slums dlc has made the graphics awesome.

It would be so satisfying to compete against true intelligence instead of predictable AI.\nUntil then the co-op is a great way to play.\nIf you get this game make sure you spend time looking through the Skills, Weapons, Armor and Armory. This is where the customizations come into play. Also make sure you collect your daily rewards and check the armory to see if you have any relics to collect. There is no tutorial for these so you just have to play around. Once we discovered these the game got so much better through endless customizations.

Ooh it might be hard to get into Oh i probably wont enjoy the graphics and gameplay much. Then I decided to whatever ill at the very least try it sincs its on sale. Then 2 hours later my Quest died cause I couldnt stop playing. It offers different types of gameplay and weapons to master and weapon switching(from launcher back to my gun on my left hand) is insanely satisfying. I highly recommend this game.

To be honest the reason I finally said lets do this was the extreme dedication from the devs. It is refreshing to see the level of dedication that these guys have for their product and I am already kicking myself that I missed the DLC sale a few days back!\n\nThese guys truly care about player experience and are customer first oriented, which seems to be getting harder to find with game devs these days, and very much appreciated. The fact that they posted a form on Reddit asking players of the game to give specific feedback for their next title, while detailing the lifecycle and development of the current title, is not only a great way to involve the community in future projects but an excellent strategy to ensure that they are bringing something to the table that will fit just right with the current player base.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of depth in this title. Theres quite a bit of weapon variety, perks, skills, upgrades, levels, game types, enemy variety as well as a ton of comfort options for VR new comers and veterans. The game is fun and fast paced. I was dosappointed to see there was a loot box system implemented but I've thus far not discovered a method by which to pay for them so I'm to overlook that for now as if there is a microtransaction system implemented its certainly not intrusive. In fact its easy to get immersed in the game and never know the upgrade system is there at all if you're like me and just want to lunge around with a sword and a gun. The graphics are pretty good as far as quest goes. So is the level and sound design. It doesnt feel restricted by hardware limitations. If I have one gripe its with the UI which can be a little wonky to navigate. There is a lot of options but with that there is quite a bit of clutter in the main menu. I've not yet found a way to change configuration options on the fly without doing the whole tutorial again which admittedly makes it easier to understand exactly what each option does VR being a relatively new platform I'm still getting used to a new set of jargon. Speaking jargon I dont know what the hell a beacon but I have a lot of them, and fabricators which I believe is the lootboxes or upgrades of some kind. I dont know. The relics are pretty straight forward to understand. They're just very general RPG perk mechanics for weapons and armor and stuff. It can difficult to decide on one because you get cosmetic slot and 3 stat slots to choose from but I dont really mind. It just adds a little more complexity to an otherwise simple premise. No story. Out of words. Sorry.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseOct 23 at 9:51 PM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars and detailed feedback!

I've had about 1 1/2 hours into the game playing the missions, challenges, and waves across various maps and weapon load outs. I've logged extensive hours in VR over the years, on various platforms including the Rift, Vive, Odyssey, and Pimax headsets so am not prone to motion sensitivity in VR. That said, if you are new to VR, you will need to probably take some time to acclimate yourself to the movement system, which primarily has you teleporting, wall-jumping and sliding through the various level maps.\n\nGame premise:\nYou play an assassin in a futuristic neo-Tokyo underworld and must navigate through each level either based on mission, challenge, or wave shooter modes. You have 5 slots to store various weapons which you can access either on your waist holsters, reaching over your shoulders, or behind your back. There are 5 completely new levels in the Quest version vs 13 levels in the original PCVR version of the game. Another nice aspect of the game is the ability to temporarily slow down time for a few seconds so you can set up that perfect kill!\n\nLocomotion:\nThere is both teleport and smooth locomotion available. However, based on the ability to do triple jumps, wall runs, and speed runs, teleport is the only way to achieve the freedom of movement that makes this game so unique and fast paced. There are snap turn options, but I found it easier to not use this at all and simply rely on physically turning. This helps to maintain better orientation to the environment.\n\nWeapons:\nOver 20 weapons in your arsenal to choose from to equip your load out. I only got through about 6 so far, so will be spending a lot more time having fun with the other weapons. I used the pistols in the beginning to keep a good distance from the enemies while I was acclimating to movement system. Reloading was a breeze, as you basically just flick the guns either down or up when you run out of bullets (you can choose either in the option settings).\n\nAs I got more comfortable however, I enjoyed using the blades and claws to inflict more close quarters damage. Surprisingly, reaching for the weapons over my shoulders, even behind my lower back, worked consistently well, in spite of the inside out tracking limitations. However, the bow and arrow handling felt slightly off and the positioning of the bow, especially drawing the arrow back closer to your head sometimes resulted in loss of tracking or glitchy hand positions. I'm hoping these can be improved in later updates.\n\nEnvironment/Scene Renderings:\nObviously, due to limitations of the mobile chip, a lot of work had to be done to optimize the assets and scenes to achieve smooth performance on the Quest. Don't expect Rift quality details on this version of the game. However, if game play is paramount, and you can live with the reduced post processing FX and lowered polygons, you can spend hours in the game and definitely have a great time honing your movement and stealth skills, weapons handling and perfecting your aim. You get various bonuses based on the type of kill you make.\n\nLevel maps varied in terms of size but overall, I felt they were large enough to move around and had different floor levels and complex layouts to adequately move around without feeling walled in or cloistered. I especially liked the Subway map.\n\nEnemies:\nThe enemy AI was a bit light and there were some instances where they would attack and then while I was moving around, did not re-adjust their position quickly enough to return attack, especially one of the boss enemies that looked a bit like E Honda from Street Fighter. So the challenge in defeating the enemies came from getting certain types of kills and relied less heavily on technique when it came to using close quarters weapons. The enemies were varied enough in the few levels that I played through from those firing guns, using katanas, firing energy shards, and a female assassin that would materialize, Nightcrawler style, in and out of the scene, as well as some higher level bosses at the end of the wave.\n\nOverall Game Rating:\nI'm actually quite hooked to the game and will be going back in later to do some more game play videos. Sairento VR : Untethered gets 5 out of 5 stars. The developers have really put a lot of effort into further refining gameplay elements since it was first released, improving visuals, and really listening to their fan base when it comes to implementing new content and features.

It has endless, random missions, multiplayer and lots of weapons. All of this being said it lacks some features and generally has some issues the pc version does not. Firstly the weapons scale is a bit out of wack with certain weapons being too small but also off position of your hands, it also lacks the campaign mode as well as some extra things such as full body avatars that pc has. If all of these were to be added this would be instant 5 stars and the cheaper price makes it forgiveable in the mean time.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseOct 31 at 12:58 AM\n\nThank you so much for the 4 stars and support!

Do to the fast nature of the game, you don't always notice the Guardian grid, and end up smacking your controllers into reality - walls, furniture, family (sorry, son!).\n\nThe game is rated mature, but there's no language and the graphics are basically PS2 level. When you chop an event in two, it's more silly than gross.\n\nSo should you get it? If you've got some space, some patience, and a willingness to ignore some hiccups, you'll have a really good time.

But after getting some store credit from Oculus for Apps I bought on the Go and a second time on the Quest, I just said \"why not?\" and got this game. And boy I am glad I did. Even at the new price of 20$ instead of the former 15$, you still get probably the most bang for you buck.\n\nThis isn't your standart affair arena/wave shooter/slicer. There are so many incentives to replay the maps, like tons of loot, leveling up your character, evolving your abilities through the skill system and stuff to upgrade your weapons, it's amazing.\n\nThe ways to build a character that suits your playstyle are manyfold. Be a dual gun wielding John Woo-Style bada** that takes out your enemies with guns blazing? Do it! Want to slice and dice your way through the levels with just one sword? Chose the melee type upgrades and become an unstoppable force of swirling and slashing metal. Want to be wolverine? You can be that too. Hawekeye? Jup, equip your bow, slow down time and take out your enemies one arrow (or three) at a time.\n\nAll this while sliding, jumping, wallrunning, double-, triple or quadruple flipping through the levels - slowing down time in order to better get that hit or slice on target.\n\nYeah, Sairento is a wild ride, and takes a small learning curve in the beginning, but once you start mastering the sh*t-tonnes of weapons, techniques and abilities it has on offer, you really feel like the baddest of a**es of a Cyber-Ninja.\n\nAnd about the devs: They have to be the most active and receptive bunch of Devs out there, interacting with and listening to their customers, and helping out whenever they can.

I was a bit unsure at first because many games I've tried tend to give me migraines and motion sickness.\n\nThis game did give me a headache at first but there are settings in the game that completely take that away. I've never seen a game so polished even in the settings.\n\nThis game already has huge amounts of replayability that I didn't know existed. As soon as you get the hang of it, not only do you feel like a true baddy (wallrunning, aerial flips and maneuvers) there's also relics to collect, each relic has a specific rarity. Orange being the highest, many relics change how a weapon is used for example a shuriken can be thrown and can lock onto targets and smgs keep firing even when they overheat to say a few. And there are hundreds of relics to collect and experiment on with different weapons. That'll make anyone coming back, have the need of wanting more.\n\nThere's quite a few maps as well as a leveling system, a skill tree, challenges and even a relic shop. This is in my opinion without a doubt in the top 5 must have quest games without a doubt.\n\nAnd there's more, the game just released multiplayer, which has furthermore increased the replayability of this game. If you like to grind in games, then this game is a no brainer. Who doesn't like to wallrun, stop time, do aerial flips in mid air and throw glaives from across the room?\n\nAs such there are a few minor improvements you could do to polish of this game and make it even more outstanding than it already is.\n\n1. In multiplayer, the boss spawns at the same time as the rest of the enemies. Taking out the boss brings the end to the game in less than 10 seconds regardless of difficulty. If there was a way to bring in the boss 'only' after all the enemies were defeated, or to be able to finish of the level by killing the rest of the enemies would solve this issue, and would make multiplayer more enjoyable, longer and ultimately more fun.\n\n2. Experience points. In multiplayer only, you get so much points after bringing down the boss. You gain 6 or 7 levels each time which doesn't happen in single player. This makes me think it's a bug or an exploit that shouldn't happen. Together with point number 1, it makes multiplayer far too easy and not challenging enough.\n\n3. There isn't any other game types other than taking down the boss within multiplayer. I'd like to see other game modes for example; survival and time attack from single player or perhaps a new game mode entirely.\n\n4. Challenges are for single player at the moment, it would be great if you could add some multiplayer challenges too.\n\n5. More weapon types so that you can feel more of a true baddy.\n\nI very much believe these improvements can be possible, the first couple I want to see first though. I know multiplayer is just out and you're working hard already. This game so far is a masterpiece and it's worth so much more than the price it's given. It's practically a steal. Hopefully this helps anyone make a decision on whether or not you should buy this game. Keep up the outstanding work guys, you guys are amazing!\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseOct 2 at 6:56 AM\n\nHey there thank you so much for your support and 5 stars! 1) You might have missed the update, we have updated the balancing of this mode please update the game and try again!

The game play itself can be repetitive, since you're just playing different arcade modes over and over again, but there is a skill tree you can upgrade along with relics to enhance various weapons. There's also a good variety of weapons.\n\nBut hands down what makes this game stand out for me is being able to wall climb and jump across the map, and assassinate some goons while doing a back flip. A caveat of course is that some people may have to work up their VR legs to be able to backflip, but I have very strong VR legs.\n\nPlus, the devs for this game are outstanding and are constantly improving the game.

I could squeeze in a quick round or two - kill me some ninjas. \n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseOct 9 at 11:55 PM\n\nThank you for your support and 5 stars!

I would love to have orange rear sights and a green front sight. My eyes are getting older (40) and trying to line up 3 white sights on the pistols is very difficult.

Once again, no cables make for a new experience, although the original game still holds its own strengths in its content. Untethered lacks the campaign and consists of very few maps which, given how smoothly the rest of the game transitioned, comes as a surprise. However, the absence of the campaign lets Sairento play to the arcade mission-generated systems that felt tacked onto the original. Elements such as daily rewards or loot boxes make the game feel more akin to a mobile experience, which I suppose Untethered actually is. I wish that the game use its daily achievements and subgoals to push for more diversity with weapon usage. Weapon variety is one of the game's biggest strengths, yet I can't help but quite literally stick to my guns. Ultimately, what I was looking for with Untethered was an exhilarating shooty experience and I was far from disappointed with what Untether offers.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseSep 17, 2019 at 1:46 AM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars!

I think more than any other title on the store right now, this game highlights the true benefits of the Quest--I found myself spinning in circles, whipping around, leaping and crouching in ways I just couldn't ever do on wired headsets I've used before. It truly lives up to the \"Untethered\" name. And while the title is rated Intense in terms of VR comfort and comes with many options to make the game less sickening in motion, I found oddly enough I felt fine at the lowest comfort settings possible even though I'm usually highly prone to VR sickness--I'm not sure how the devs accomplished this feat, but it was a sigh of relief, as I'd put off buying the game for a long time for fear it'd be a nausea fest like some others I've tried. An absolute bargain at its current price, and the devs continue to add new free updates with additional content that only sweetens the deal. I really can't recommend this game enough, it's the most fun I've ever had with a virtual reality experience and truly highlights why the Quest--and VR as a whole--are more than just a gimmick.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseSep 17, 2019 at 1:35 AM\n\nThank you so much for the 5 stars and the support!

One huge plus is that you can change all your movement controls exactly how you prefer.\n\nWhen first playing using default movement settings I was having a miserable time. But after going through each gameplay option I was amazed. Turning on Free Rotation, no slide when landing after a jump, then maxing out speed for both rotation and locomotion makes the experience incredible.\n\nThis game is a combination of what Superhot, Swords of Gargantua and first person shooters wished they could be. If you want to slow down time, Just hold the jump and time slows as you get pinpoint accurate shots. If you want to become an unstoppable dual sword wielding ninja you have multiple options of melee weapons. Do you like using ranged weapons? Multiple options there as well. Are you a shooter fan? Plenty of guns to choose from. And if that is not enough, you get to have them all at the same time! You can have any combination, dual wield on both shoulders and hips and an extra weapon slot on your lower back all at the same time. You can grab your guns and fire away while speed running toward the enemy, leap to great heights while switching weapons mid air and come down for the kill with plasma swords. I cant get enough of it.\n\nNot to mention the leveling aspects are super solid. You level talent trees. Want to run as a tank with regenerating health? Would you rather be a super dexterous ninja with 4 air jumps without touching the ground? Those are just two of the numerous options of talent trees. Additionally you level your weapon skills and collect relics for all weapons and armor that add extra abilities.\n\nReady to up your game? Go beyond normal or hard mode and challenge your skills on expert. Need to play somewhere in the middle? Just add game modifiers. The versatility of game play is the best I have experienced.\n\nThis game has it all.\nSairento VR should be your very first purchase to see the best of what the Oculus Quest has to offer.\n\nHelpful | 30\nDeveloper ResponseJun 29, 2019 at 4:30 AM\n\nThank you for the wonderful review.

Then I downloaded Vader Immortal, and thought \"Okay, this thing has POTENTIAL\". I also enjoyed Moss, and then not much else. I have returned most games from the store thinking that Quest just isn't what I hoped it'd be.\n\nAnd the PRICES. I get it that these 3D games have to cost a bit to make, but, I'd rather spend money on a WAY better experience on my Xbox.\n\nThen they release a $15 game like this!? This is EXACTLY what I was hoping for when I bought my Quest.\nThis is the first game that has me hopping all over my living room, (and accidentally beating the crap out of my chandelier). Devs, I will give you guys $45 if you up the ante on your next game. I see you're making some tweaks to this one, (multiplayer would be the BUSINESS, but, it'd be fair to charge me a little more for that, as I've only had the game for a couple of hours, and already got more than my money's worth).\n\nSo, thank you team, you just saved me on the final days of being able to return my quest. On your next title, charge me more and I'll pay it, as I can tell from the game and your responses to other reviews, it'd be worth the price..

But that hasn't made the game less addictive for me.\n\nFor now, I think I've broken the game. I'm at level 205, my Sluggers do 1680 damage/sec, with backup pistols that do similar. And by playing 4 rounds of endless at a time, my SMG power increases faster than the enemy health. The bosses are dying within 2 seconds, and point/inventory updates after the matches are freezing the game.\n\nBest game on quest right now.

There is a learning curve tho, if your new to VR I recommend you get this game but try to get a feel of the VR worlds first, I played around for less than 10 min the first time. I found it difficult as I just started playing VR. I practiced with some free demos for a day and a half then went back to it now I'm hooked. I'm living out my fantasy as a cyber ninja and having so much fun. If you try your best to learn the locomotive mechanics it will be a rewarding experience.\n\nI'm sliding and shooting while I gut the closest enemy at the same time. I jump in the air and hold jump again, everything goes slow motion allowing me to aim ahs take out multiple enemies from the air, then dashing forward as I land and cutting enemies in half with the blade. Really good game, it can be a little buggy not often tho, but I believe the whole untethered VR experience is like that across the platform, what I do as a precaution is exit the app and restart my Quest. This game is like Call of Duty had a baby with Sekiro then they got a divorce, leaving the baby to fend for it's self so it gets raised by wolves and becomes a bad @ss.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseAug 24, 2019 at 9:28 AM\n\nThank you so much for giving us a 5 star rating!

It also appeals to the tinkerer in me, since you can experiment with loadouts, weapon mods and the skill trees forever. You need to invest a bit of time in learning all your movement option (I found a very good guide on Steam, google something like sairento controls). Can give you a bit of vr sickness, but it isnt too bad even for a vr newbie like me. Can be played sitting down in a chair! You will loose a bit of dynamics in the movement, but sometimes I dont want to jump around, getting all sweaty. Graphics is ok, but not amazing but the frame rate is rock steady.

This game is so immersive that even the strongest of stomachs will feel queasy after all the jam packed action you are handed. The premise of the game is to complete certain tasks whether doing it loud or silently like a true ninja. The setting is in a neo Japan environment so expect futuristic fire arms at the ready. However, don't let the enemies guns intimidate you. You can easily dodge bullets with agility, or just plain cut them up with our trusty katana(s). The amount of movement you are given in this game is INSANE. You've got double jumping, wall-running, sliding, walking, and the best addition which is flipping. You are also given the ability for slow motion and ground pounding. This game is always handing out updates. Each one satisfying your needs. Don't let some false reviews fool you. For the current price of the game, it's too good to be true. Take this game out for a test run. I promise you will enjoy it as much as I have been!\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseAug 13, 2019 at 11:33 PM\n\nThanks so much for giving us a 5 star review!

Its sooooo Awesome\n\nI bought this game the other day and was thinking it was just meh...after I read something about turning full locomotion on I was intrigued. I really hate teleportation in games...Im not on my psvr, I have thumb sticks...after doing that and turning flips on (yes its as friggen awesome as it sounds) I was amazed at how much better the game felt. You feel like Neo!!\nThere are so many option settings in this game that I have to thank the developers. They truly thought of everyone! This game is waaaaaay under priced and again the developers keep making this game better with updates! The graphics have been upgraded and this game is by far worth every penny! Thank you to the dev team for being passionate about your game!

Stay tuned!", "DrefnerdJul 7, 2019 at 10:22 PM\nMy favorite Quest game!\n\nSairento Untethereds graphical downgrade(from the PC and PSVR versions) proves one thing...Who cares when Im having this much fun!!\nHeres a few of my thoughts on the game:\n1. At first the control scheme is a bit disorienting. Hang in there, though. Play as much as you can at a time and eventually you will be rewarded with some of the MOST dynamic and intuitive VR controls ever. Double jumping, wall running, sliding, shooting and slicing will eventually become second nature to you. Almost to the point that you start to feel other action games on the Quest are missing something. After a week or two with this game I never cease to marvel at how fluid the controls are.\n2. Those weapons tho!! The fact that you can make a load out with dual wielded Wolverine claws THAT YOU CAN ALSO FIRE the blades out one at a time is epic! Right out of the gate, the number of blades, pistols, smgs, shuriken, a bow, a sickle on a chain, and a few other ninja artillery, offer so many fun load out combinations to try. There are also perks you earn from missions that can be added to each weapon, and piece of armor. (For instance, I added perks to the bow that make arrows go through more than one enemy and ricochet off multiple walls.)\n3. There are only 5 unique levels. Which might not seem like a lot. But the ones that are included here are a ton of fun to run around in. (The subway is my favorite!)\n\nTo the developers. I saw on Reddit that you asked if players would pay for DLC. I for one definitely would! Your game puts a smile on my face everytime I play. Thank you\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJul 7, 2019 at 11:41 PM\n\nThank you so much for the kind support.

Its great fun once you get the hang of wielding multiple weapons and my favourite parts is running along the walls for as long as possible going from one wall to the other and just raining down bullets! Such fun and then going in for slide samurai slices but my only criticism would probably be that there arent really many levels. It just seems to be the same 5 or so levels over and over again with different load outs of enemies. I would really like it if there could be more levels to fight in especially levels where wall running is easy to do like the mall with the train station below. I just wall run round the square mall room non stop.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseAug 24, 2019 at 8:57 AM\n\nHey there!

We are glad you had enjoyed the game. So allow us to share with you the reasons we aren't able to include the campaign in. When we first started development, we never knew about the Quest. So some of the assets will require a fair bit of optimization works. As a result, we felt that it was more efficient if we start from ground up instead, creating new maps rather than reusing the older ones. Also we think that one of the selling points of Sairento is in the gameplay itself and we wanted to continue our focus on it to see how far we can further push the game. Our plans moving forward is to have more game modes, maps and weapons over the next couple of months! Some of them might be free as a way for us to thank players who had purchased the game!

Great experience so far. Im having some issues sliding when I want to slide. Sometimes it thinks Im crouching, but My knee is just slightly bent. Off of a flip or a stride. This feature (sliding) is a must to avoid getting hit while attacking. I tried messing with the settings a bit. Still couldnt come up with a solution. Great options to prevent motion sickness, but its too fun playing with those options on. IE: back flipping, you have to turn it on and experience it. At least one time. Lol.\n\nEdit after updates: This developer is an example for other devs. This game already has two updates. Huge ones. I changed my rating to a 5 star, because they deserve it.

The only reason I dont give 5 stars is because the aiming system kinda sucks , main reason I cant use shurikens, knives , etc, they just fly to wrong places except for where you target .

If you are looking to buy a fun and visceral game which will offer lasting appeal you will find it here. Im glad I finally got it. The game offers slick and varied action in spades.

For only 15 dollars (the cost of a movie) you get to feel like a ninja / matrix character. In this game there are so many ways to defeat your opponent and do it in style. At first I got a bit nauseous moving around so fast but once I figured out the best way to play for myself and honed in on my movement strategy i was flying around and slicing over opponents heads, it was crazy. The versatility of the weapons is soo nice combined with the array of movements, it really makes for a dynamic experience. You can upgrade your character and its gear which keeps you wanting to achieve new goals and makes playing more fun as you upgrade.\n\nI would love to see more content around new places to play. I do feel that is quite repetitive. In addition to that, Adding more cell shading to the environment like you fo with the characters would make it look less bland and boxy in my opinion although maybe I am incorrect. Mostly I am just interested in new levels with a bit industrial and cold feeling and less boxed in. For 15 dollars though this game truly delivers.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseAug 3, 2019 at 11:31 PM\n\nThanks so much for supporting us!

I didn't expect to like this so much, I've never been a huge fan of the cyber ninja look, but the real star is the gameplay.\n\n6 - 8 Hour of play.\nThere is nothing like sliding along the ground and chopping a dudes legs off or using a bow like it's Breath of the Wild and slowing down time for that perfect shot. It did take me about an hour to get used to the movement but once I did, it's incredible.\n\nTo keep this short and sweet. Is it worth it? Oh yes. I think I would have bought this if it were in the 15-20 range because the gameplay is so tight, so it's defiantly worth 10.99. This is a must have for fans of intense action VR games.\n\nFinally, I will update this review over time, this above is 6-8 hours of experience. Below is the following hours.\n\n8 - 18 Hours of play.\nFirst things first, each weapon is incredible! All of them have a completely different levels of mastery and attachable items (maybe except the three swords the game offers which are nearly all the same).\nThe game starts you off duel wielding swords & pistols with a backup SMG, but if thats not your style and you want a more ninja like experience you can switch out to a sword wielding, arrow shooting, shuriken throwing executioner. You can even just drop the whole stealth act and run around with shotguns, assault rifles and other speical weapons.\nAnother addition and important game mechanic is weapon attachments/buffs/Relics, these can change a weapon slightly or drastically, increasing its aim assist, damage and ammo pool, thats the normal ones. Then you get things like projectiles bounce of the surfaces, throw 2 more shuriken's, stealthy attacking increases damage by 200%. This leads to having very creative builds and there is so much more.\nThe main reason I'm talking more about the weapons is because thats the big reason you want to play this game and the main reasons you will keep playing.\n\nMissions are just that, missions. There isn't a campaign so the draw to play the game is to get better gear, to do harder missions and get further in the challenging endless mode. There is a few different type of missions and more than a few maps, but the objective is always, kill the dudes and survive.\n\nI still keep coming back to this game but I can now see where the end point may be. Once I have got all the upgrades or when I feel like the game gets to easy or I get far enough into endless mode that I can be proud of.\n\nI will probably update this one more time when I feel like I can put this game down for a bit and wait for extra content or a DLC to drop. But overall this is the best action game on the Quest.\nThanks for reading.\n<3\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJul 18, 2019 at 11:38 PM\n\nThank you so much for the extensive write up.

Everything I loved about the gameplay is here. Still the deep customization, weapons loadouts and upgrade system. The dismemberment and acrobatics are all here and feel amazing without a wire to get tangle up in. It took me a while to remember that I could turn and twist any way i needed to and it becomes a very freeing and exhilarating experience! The graphics are also a LOT better that what I was expecting. Almost like the first versions of the game that came out a while ago, maybe with less details is all. The sense of height and depth is very strong here and Im still scratching my head wondering how the devs pulled this off on the Quest. Bravo guys and thanks for bringing this AAA experience to us.

My one minor complaint is that I think graphics can be more optimized at least cleverly I would add more detail to enemies as u mainly are slicing them close and having seen robo recall I bet this can look much better.

Great mechanics in terms of ease of movement and double jumps and bouncing off everything and anything. Double swords, guns, etc that are easy to use as well. Have been using my left hand only as right/dominant arm is messed up at moment and still loved it/was able to play perfectly with one controller being weapon and movement. One of the few games where I got the feeling of almost falling off a tall structure (but in a good way). Lots of content and replay ability. For folks that dont give games like this 5 stars, I kinda question the expectations of the reviewer over the game. A not so great meal that you eat once and poop out a few hours later costs like $10.

Always been a Kung Fu fan and giving me the ability to straight NEO and wall run while pulling out a shot gun, or throwing star, or bow and arrow, or pistol, or Black Panther claws that shoot nail darts, or whatever else you think a cyborg, weapon wielding ninja would have is such a fun experience. The mechanics take a little getting used to but give it a few runs and you will be a bonafide killing machine in no time. Well done developers.

By a pretty large margin. Period. Full stop. And the price is crazy reasonable!!!I was worried when it was announced to be a pared down version but it is absolutely, without a doubt, worth your time and money. The movement is cool, the weapons are varied and it looks great (hardware considered).\n\nThe biggest difference between it and other games currently available is a solid progression system. I'd much rather unlock things, loot and develop a character than pointlessly plug away at a leaderboard, which in my opinion vr relies on a bit too much.

But I fiddled with the (considerable) options to enable full locomotion and the more brilliant silly stuff like gliding, slo-mo backflips and changing katana grip angle to 'stab'.\n\nAnd then it blew my mind. It encourages creative and varied play, and the more ridiculous you try to be, the more the game rises to meet you. Zipping through the air headshotting with your Deckard-style pistols and then grabbing your katanas as you land to eviscerate the fool behind you... It's incredible. It seems to have the single goal of making you feel like an unstoppable future ninja and gives you all the tools to make that happen.\n\nIt's scrappier than the likes of Robo Recall, but the team behind this obviously has a lot of passion and talent and the feel is perfect. It's a complete steal at this price and represents a real jewel in the Quest's crown. The more you play it, the more it demands to be played.\n\nI know that trade-offs had to be made from the Steam version, and I don't really care - but what I do miss is the missions where you move between areas, like the compartments of a train. Arenas are all very well, but I'm sure that a bit of jiggery pokery would allow discrete rooms for the player to move between once all of the enemies in one had been killed.\n\nAlso, I really love the way that stealth works in this game and I wish there was more of it. There's nothing like dropping from the rafters and stabbing someone in the back before being spotted, or picking off the scouts one by one from the towers.\n\nOne last thing - the kurisigama is bloody astonishing.

Definitely we have the heart n soul to push this as far as we can so do stay tuned for more stuffs! :) And we like to say thanks again for the support!", "VexinJul 14, 2019 at 4:27 AM\nIncredible action, an adrenaline shot\n\nWith crisp controls and movement, action-packed gameplay, a multitude of weapons and probably the best ninja fantasy in any video game ever, Sairento VR is by far my favorite game on the Quest.\n\nI'm a fan of The Matrix, I loved GunZ (the video game), I like ninjas (who doesn't) and this pays homage to all of those, but it goes much further than that. This game is just done well in general and done well for VR. Everything is crisp and intuitive, the controls are easy and so is moving around and the way you use weapons. Whenever you get a kill it feels exhilarating. And the more you get into it the more it seems to unfold. The game rewards multiple approaches and you can go in flaying wildly and have a lot of fun, but you can also use finesse and precision. It's almost a tool of expression and I caught myself doing extra flourishes several times because it just felt cool.\nOn the hardest difficulties it can also be a challenge with deaths and retries rarely feeling punishing or unfair.\nI love this game and I'll be playing it a lot. I'm looking forward to seeing where the devs take it next. Multiplayer or an actual campaign could be a blast if done right.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 15, 2019 at 2:46 AM\n\nThank you so much for the kind words!

Then... I found myself coming back to Sairento again and again and again, tweaking options, checking upgrades and skills, adjusting loads out, etc.\nAnd after giving up on having it refund because it was so addictive, I eventually understood: the gameplay is unpolished because its you to polish it, fine tune it up to the way you prefer it, mastering the moves, approaches, items, abilities!\nLike a famous burger chain would say:  Have it your way  ;-)\nCherry on top, the devs keep working on it for the better, with graphical upgrades and more options.\n\nLove it!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13, 2019 at 10:41 AM\n\nSuper glad you did not went for a refund :) I think the menu is something that's giving players a possible not so good first impression and on hindsight, we really thought it could be better executed.

Able to keep track of surroundings easier. My favorite comic character is Wolverine so playing with the 3 bladed kigiri is a blast.\n\nHowever, there's something lacking. Primarily training(or even an explanation) in how to use some of the specialty weapons, particularly the glaive and the kusarigama.\n\nAlso, an explanation of what some of the challenges mean. One of them calls for ashigaru kills but I've no idea what that means.\n\nThose things aside, there's others weapons to use that are more straight forward and fun to use and other challenges that you know what they mean.\n\nThe training and challenge issues are the only things keeping me from giving this game 5 stars. I have a blast playing it using primarily the bow and arrow and the kigiri.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 22, 2019 at 8:31 AM\n\nHey thanks so much for giving us your support! Totally taken note of your suggestion we'll like to see if we can further improve on the training and challenge issues mentioned!

There's definitely a learning curve to the movement, but every time you nail it, it feels great.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the maps. You get (5) maps and out of those five, only the \"subway\" map really gives me that \"NeoTokyo\" feel. I appreciate all of the effort that the devs have made to create new content to fit the quest, but more maps that really nail that futuristic tokyo city setting would be much appreciated.\n\nIf you are looking for an arcade style shooter you can just jump into and spray away at, this is your game. Just expect to spend some time getting used to the movement. For $15, I don't think you can go wrong with Sairento and It's definitely is a nice addition to my library.\n\nIf you want a video review of my opinions, you can check it out here: https://youtu.be/EEa95wzYLo0\n\nor just search \"big tea\" on YouTube. Hopefully I helped someone out!\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJun 30, 2019 at 8:57 AM\n\nAwesome and very much appreciate your frank opinions!

After playing it for 2 hours I can say that this is not superhot on steroids. This game need no game to be compared with. Because it has a personality on its own.\n\nBefore writing this review I was trying to think of a similar game... But I can't.\nNo other game offer loadouts, loots, skill trees, daily missions, ...\n\nI will go in deep when I will reach 5-10h of gameplay. But right now... For that price!

When I first came across the game I wasnt really sold on it and didnt think it was something I would play because of my game preferences but after watching some gameplay footage I decided to purchase the game and give it a try and Im very glad I did! The game is just over the top fun it is a massive ninja playground! From being able to run across the environment walls shooting at enemies and then quickly and easily being able to switch to the swords and other various weapons is something I never imagined Id get to experience in this way theres just so many unique ways you can take down the enemys! every ledge or wall in the game can be used to your advantage to and help you chain together multiple kills in a few seconds its insane and what makes it more impressive is the game runs buttery smooth too Ive experienced absolutely no frame rate issues or bugs which is very impressive and an important part of keeping you immersed in the vr experience! Ive certainly got my monies worth out this game so far and I look forward to continuing playing it! Also Ive read some comments about the visuals but in my opinion the game is so fast paced if your playing it correctly your not even going to have time to notice imperfections and the visuals do actually seem to have improved after I updated the game recently. Im leaving the game 5 stars its fantastic and a great achievement from the developers getting it onto the quest in the first place.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 12, 2019 at 9:46 AM\n\nThanks so much for the really kind words and we are grateful for your support and 5 stars!

I really didnt think I'd like this game but after getting used to the moving, jumping off walls, sliding etc the gameplay is absolutely a blast. This is one of the rare occasions that teleporting works great. This is my most played game on the quest as of now. I just wish the graphics were just a bit better but I know its difficult because of the limitations of the quest but I'm starting to feel gameplay over graphics is more important and that's fine with me. Great job to whoever made this game.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJul 1, 2019 at 10:03 PM\n\nMany thanks for the 5 stars!

After spending some time in the dojo area jumping around and getting used to things I soon realised this is totally playable and enjoyable! The feeling of chaining together wall running, shooting, slicing and Slo mo is just awesome! I never played the original version but have seen videos, there is obviously the graphical down grade for quest, but the gameplay is so much fun I cant see that this matters at all!

First and foremost there needs to be an option to adjust gun angle - it's angled too high at the moment. Besides that I'm just hungry for more content and any other tweaks or optimizations the team behind this game decides to do!\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 30, 2019 at 10:01 PM\n\nDefinitely! The angle issue is one of the more frequent comments we have received and will get this sorted out in a patch soonest! Apart from that we still have more stuffs coming your way this year. Many thanks for your kind words and support! :)", "KyberSoulJul 9, 2019 at 12:00 PM\nBest bang for your buck\n\nI got this game after a lot of debate, I saw people complaining about the graphics and that put me off a bit but not much (graphics isnt why im using VR, the experience is) now jumping into that last bit.\n\nThe experience: if you are prone to motion sickness then you might want to consider a different game because this game is intense. I havent figured out how to do the flips and stuff yet but wall running, multi jumps, slowmo kills and all things ninja included just make you feel so awesome. (Updated) after putting in about 4 or so hours last night and having an amazing time with every single step, wall run, and slide. There is so much to this game with an amazing in depth skill tree system, the loadouts and ability to save them is so fun. I use 2 for my main \"try-hard\" loadouts and the rest will have like a single weapon that I use as \"challenge/mess around\" loadouts. If you like ninjas and feeling like youre the star of an action movie I highly suggest this game.\n\nNow some cons, personally i struggle with the kuni and glaive so much so I just dont use them anymore, the bow and gun positioning feels off and makes aiming a little awkward but not unusable (I love the bow and use it every single level along with the wolverine claws)\n\nThe relics alone make this super fun I hope to see more weapons I love the chain scythe (I'm awful with them but man when I get those suckers going and take out an entire room of people it feels so good) over all I think this game is easily a 5 star game. Great controls and mechanics, a lot of my time is going to be lost to this game. As to the devs question on reddit I would happily pay for dlc maps and multiplayer. A simple 2v2 deathmatch would be amazing and to avoid people being slaughtered by high level players you can restrict relics to single player only so its just the base weapon stats and abilities for mp. Great job and a fantastic game and im super excited for future updates\n\nRe: Dev team,\nI saw your post on reddit and the biggest thing that made me decide to buy this game was how open and honest you guys are with the community. Keep on being awesome and as I stated above, I'm super excited for future updates! =D\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 8, 2019 at 11:32 PM\n\nThanks so much for supporting us! First up, so the gun angles will be fixed in the next patch. You'll have an option to set at various intervals of angle to cater to preferences. (Cool eh?) Better graphics are coming your way tho we do agree with you that experiences are super important. :) That's the reason why we VR-up, to get different experiences that in our daily life, it is hard for us to get. For flipping, you will have to enable it via the settings because it is disabled by default. Was told that it was too dangerous to allow it to be enabled by default :P Appreciate the 5 stars!", "lennieplopJul 1, 2019 at 3:28 PM\nJust feels amazing to play\n\nThe quest was my first vr headset, and I'm a sucker for action games, so Ive played most of the ones on the system. Having that said, I can confidently say that sairento is the most enjoyable and action-packed title on the quest so far, as long as you don't get motion sick.\n\nAfter you get used to the controls, you'll instinctively fly through rooms at high speeds, slashing and shooting your way through hordes of enemies with ease. The game's got a wide variety of weapons and modifications and missions are equally varied. If that was't enough, the game's just 15 dollars, so it's great value for your money.\n\nThe only thing that felt a little odd to me was the hand size and placement: your hands in this game are really small, for some reason.\n\nAll in all, though, it's pretty great title for the quest.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJul 1, 2019 at 9:48 PM\n\nThanks for supporting us! You got it! We will be adding an option to tweak the angle as our very first patch to come in a couple of weeks so hang in there. (along with graphical improvements) After which, we'll be adding more content later on so stay tuned!", "dr.edgeworthJun 29, 2019 at 1:23 PM\nGood game with tons of options\n\nMy first concern when I bought this game was motion sickness, as I am quite prone to it in VR. This game, however, has a ton of options inside to help minimize motion sickness and enabling different features of the parkour. I've worked my way up to allow the flipping, jumping, and sliding that you can see in the trailers and such, and it's really fun. So if you're thinking about not picking this game up because of motion sickness, just know, it's a good game no matter what vr legs you have, and it's a great game to build those vr legs. The graphics also look like a ps2 game, but playing the game will get you lost in it so quickly that you never notice it unless you're looking at screenshots or have downtime in game. Really fun game, great work.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 29, 2019 at 10:27 PM\n\nHaha thanks so much for giving us a 5 star rating! You said it right :) We considered a ton of movement options so that we can cater to as many folks as we possibly can.", "FrostfighterJun 30, 2019 at 7:36 AM\nSuch a good game for $15\n\nI cannot believe how much content is actually present in this game. When you first boot it up, it might seem kind of lack luster with it's few maps but after messing around in the settings, turning on sliding after dashing and a few other settings, it becomes apparent very quickly that you could make the experience fit exactly what you would want because there are so many ways to customize the experience.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to an arena game like quake 3 arena. I have a lot of fun just picking a load out and trying to survive. The bots are kind of silly sometimes, but because you can ramp up the difficulty yourself in the settings, they do a great job of scaling from casual play to more serious level play.\n\nThe thing that would make this game even more top tier than it already is, is simply additional maps with good variety. Having only 5 maps does get kind of stale. Additional weapons would also be cool but honestly that would just be the cherry on top if extra maps were added.\n\nMy only other complaint with the game is it is very easy to get stuck inside objects sometimes. When this happens, you can't always move right away and must find a way to get unstuck. Really not too big of an issue but it does get frustrating.\n\nAll in all, holy cow what a great game. I cannot wait for additional content. This is one of my favorite experiences in vr right now.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 30, 2019 at 8:19 AM\n\nGlad you had a great time with Sairento VR! So a couple of stuffs. Definitely we agree that 5 maps isn't enough. Given the encouraging results we have seen so far, we have quickly decided that we want to keep on adding and supporting content for a while. So you'll certainly see more stuffs coming this year. Additional weapons might be quite a far fetch for now. (Just being really honest) But hang on...we are really looking into optimizing further so that we can incorporate more enemies into the game. This will in time to come allow us to assess if multiplayer is a feasible option. If that works out, we think it would be super fun! So regarding getting stuck. Our sincere apologies for now as due to the movement system, it tends to happen but we are patching as we go along so... we do seek your kind patience for a while.

The experience this game gives if you is nothing short of amazing, but between those great experiences is clunkiness.\n\nFirst off, aiming\nThe tracking of the pistols with the iron sights seems off, especially after playing robo recall. You're forced to tilt the front of the touch controller down much more to get iron sights lined up, and while bearable, it gets uncomfortable. This should be an easy fix with a software update\n\nSecondly, tracking\nTracking for grabbing weapons over your shoulders, behind your back, and at your waist works 60% of the time for me. I'm not sure what it is but it seems to get clunky and soon as I get in a fight. I'll find myself reaching over my shoulder my sword then grab and slash to find I'm only swinging my bear hand. ALSO I recommend making so your right hand can only get items on your right side and left hand only get items on the left. Many times I reach over my right shoulder for a sword and find myself with the bow from my left shoulder instead.\n\nThirdly?\nThis is a bit more nitpicking but I think the menu could use some tinkering with and be a bit more simplified. With so many options on screen I wish it would be broken down into simpler sections.\n\nFinal\nClunkiness held back my otherwise great experience and put my review at 3 stars. If an update happens in the future however to correct these issues I'll give a solid 5.\n(Update)\nExtra star for quick developer response and fixed pistol handling. Still minor tracking issues and the menu would benefit with simpler toggles and interface.

Everything from the diversity of the weapons, the excellent level design, and the locomotion controls makes the game immersive and all around a blast. One of the best parts is the skill system and relics that add even more variety to the game by mixing up your playstyle. My current favorite loadout is a stealthy bow and arrow build, and its exciting to know that if i get bored with it i can respec all my skill points and build an entirely different loadout. Overall 5/5 highly recommended.

I wasnt worried about jumping sliding and flipping motions since I was used to that type of gameplay before. I was already having a lot of fun just in the main menu jumping around and shooting at nothing. When you jump into the arenas they feel like playgrounds. You just want to start jumping off walls, doing huge jumps and try to pull off cool moves simply for style (which the game tracks).\n\nI wasnt expecting more than a wave shooter but theres a lot of variables, weapons, skills and modifiers that can change the way each match plays. The loot system is an added bonus.

This game is clunky, confusing, and unpolished. When I first started playing I was bored and uninterested. But holy sh*t. Just go into settings, mess around with the controls until you find a control setup you think youll like, enable flipping (this is my favorite part of the game), and youre set. Just make a cool load out and youre officially a ninja. The feeling of flying, sliding, and flipping all while switching in and out of slow motion and experimenting with tons of different weapons (most of which are very unique and interesting) is unparalleled. If you thought superhot made you feel awesome, this will make you feel like a god. I cannot recommend this enough, especially at this price ($15 is a steal). The only reason I wouldnt get it is if you get motion sick easily or dont want to bother messing with the controls and figuring out certain mechanics on your own.\n\nOn paper, this game is pretty mediocre. The graphics are just ok. The sound effects are pretty awful. The menus are cluttered and overwhelming. But the game has one goal: to make you feel like a ninja. And it does this perfectly.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 28, 2019 at 12:36 AM\n\nThanks so much for giving us the 5 stars despite the situations you have encountered!

I love this game, but prefer it on Quest yet I have never played on PC sadly. The fluidity of Quest compared to PSVR tracking is flawless. The graphics comparing from a launch PS4 to Quest are almost identical as well yet the Quest has better resolution for this game although I havent compared with PS4 pro yet.

The movement system is the best part about the game by far and I hope others implement this waypoint/teleport hybrid system in other games.\n\nLocomotion can be very disorienting and I have been inconsistently getting sick. Sometimes Im sick in 15 mins and sometimes I dont get sick for over an hour of playing. So, take the game in small increments and frequent breaks until your brain gets used to it.\n\nThe downside is that the graphics really have taken a hit. Although the weapon textures are amazing, the textures for enemies are pretty bad. I like the way a couple enemies look, the geisha and blue samurai look pretty good, but others look almost like N64 models. A couple levels are graphically more impressive than the others as well so this leads me to believe that it could be better overall with some optimization.\n\nContent is very deep. The relic bonuses are useful for stats and some added skills feel like you are progressing, but you start with every weapon there will be in the game. I would have preferred to have limited basic weapons while unlocking some more as the game progressed as part of the loot system. For example, the starting swords this way have no benefit over the others as some do more damage straight away.\n\nOverall the game is very fun and though the Quest chip is rather limiting for graphics, I do believe that models and textures could be improved either by restylizing some enemies or rounding polygons out a bit more.\n\nFor the price this game is really incredible. If they add more content like they plan to, hopefully with weapons(or skins), maps, and enemies, the game will be infinitely replay-able. At the moment, however, you still at least get your moneys worth and can build up your VR legs while having a lot of fun.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 28, 2019 at 11:05 PM\n\nThanks for giving us a nice review and we are glad you felt that you got your money's worth!

It is very immersion-breaking to have to constantly think aim lower than it feels like I should.\n\n2. Menu graphics.

First of all, theres no real hit box in the game for enemies. Youre going to be flailing around like youre painting a Jackson Pollock. Its my number one complaint. I dont feel cool or smooth at all in this game. Enemies will mostly just bounce off of you when you teleport to them so you need to move forward to actually hit them and eventually youll run out of space and hit your wall.\nSecondly the movement is awful. You constantly get stuck on walls and cant teleport away so that becomes a new game mechanic for you. Jump at bad guys but dont land near a wall or else you cant teleport away for a few moments and by that time youre dead.\nIm sure its really hard to make these games perfect, but I just cant get into it with these game breaking features.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseAug 13, 2019 at 8:47 PM\n\nHeya! So sorry about these game breaking features that you have encountered :( We have been trying to improve the hitboxes and the jumping mechanics around the wall area so i hope you can be patient with us and give us a re-review after subsequent patches if we got it right! Thank you so much for the detailed description of the issues you have encountered!", "Snake0457Jun 27, 2019 at 2:56 PM\nFun, but needs work.\n\nHit detection, specifically swords, feels off (ie it contacts with enemy but doesnt register a hit). AI gets stuck a lot or just hops inbetween 2 spots, and generally doesnt try to find you, making it kind of hide and seek-ish. There is a bug that appears to freeze the game when going to the Oculus Home screen and attempting to return to the game (which is fairly easy to do accidentally). Regardless, the idea is cool and once you learn your way around the limitations it can be quite fun. Just hoping for some updates.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJun 28, 2019 at 3:54 AM\n\nAppreciate the support and 4 stars! Definitely there will be more updates in time to come.

Purchased, refunded and purchased again ;). Now it's fun.\nI feel relicts should be a little bit more scarce. I am bit overwhelmed by the flood of relics you get and constantly managing them, on top of that come the accents which seem to be of no use at all (it's also cumbersome to have to unequip a relic before being able to sell it). I also don't like that you can respec skills at will. Once you trained a skill it should not be removable from your character. Instead there should be save slots for running multiple characters at once. Also it would be much more interesting if the skills improved only by using them instead of assigning points at will. Unfortunately all in all it feels more like a sandbox than a game with a goal. I think a more restrictive gameplay would make it more interesting and keep the long term motivation up (harder to get relics, not the full arsenal of weapons at start, no respec of skills).\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 1, 2019 at 7:42 PM\n\nNow we have to thank you twice!

It was fun, fast paced, and over-the-top. Think Warframe in VR. On PC, the views and locations are more impressive, but the core gameplays here (ironically, it runs better on my Quest). It also kind of resembles an amateur Unity game or something (More so on this port), but dont let that fool you. Another aspect I want to touch on is the price... I like it. Especially when most decent games cost an arm and a leg if you want a good amount of them. The one thing I wanted for Sairento on PC.... was a live player base. I thought the Quest could peak interest again and help with that, but I was a bit disappointed to find out it would have that. Maybe it could be implemented? I dont see it taking up too much space. Otherwise, I love this game. Devs, could ya make it happen? P.S The weapon angles are a little off, making it kinda hard to aim. I hope thats fixed too...\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 29, 2019 at 3:58 AM\n\nYesss we heard you! Certainly one of the more requested features. So the Quest has a specific requirement of a good FPS to be maintained.

Not the unique teleporting dash-gameplay, which is fine. The problem is dodging enemy attacks, the default movement felt unresponsive and I'd tell it to move to attempt to dodge and she'd just sit there. After reading some reviews I decided to try smooth movement, which is a little nauseating but the gameplay is waaay better, where I can freely strafe and dodge and move around.\n\nSo, it's way better with smooth movement and even better once I used the loadout menu for more weapons, but it's still pretty buggy. Yesterday I had a wave where there was one enemy left but either they never spawned or they were inaccessible on the map. The melee hit detection seems pretty bad, it misses probably 60% of my swings that I clearly hit, and there seems to be a delay for when you can hit the enemy again and since there is no hit stun on some enemies (maybe there is on weaker?) you're just swinging and nothing is happening as they attack you. There's no sword clashing which means you have to run when they attack instead of blocking and I really don't think you can dodge with your body for some attacks. I hope they're using raycast-based melee hit detection, because collision-based or hitbox-based won't work if your movements are faster than frames, your sword will skip right through them, which kind of seems like it might be the problem here (or not, who knows).\n\nThe other thing is the ragdolls and dismemberment. The don't stick around long. The other thing is something's off with their physics, so their limbs bounce around hyper-fast and unrealistically.\n\n[edit] Thanks for reply. I have a suggestion regarding the framerate drop. Tekken has an oft-praised slow-mo when you win a round, you could add an option for something similar, which is easier on framerate and could help fill the void of satisfying hit-stop effects largely missing in VR games.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 20, 2019 at 11:09 PM\n\nHey there! Thanks so much for playing Sairento VR! Totally agree with you on some of the points. However due to the limitations of the device, there are a lot of stuffs we had to hold back on. For instance the ragdolls hanging around too much does cause the FPS to drop a bit which is important to experience as well. In an ideal situation we would love for that to happen. In VR, maintaining steady FPS is #1 priority as that has the potential to induce motion sickness. Hence in a situation like that we had to deal with some tradeoffs. Having said that, we are continuously exploring ways to improve the graphical experience and pushing the boundaries. You will see that in patches to come, we will have more optimizations as well as content to further the play. Hopefully if you think we had improved, pleas give us another re-review. :)", "sad-snorlax69Jul 20, 2019 at 4:24 AM\nAmazing\n\nIt was a very nice and intense game you must buy it you wont regret it\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 20, 2019 at 7:11 AM\n\nMany thanks for giving us a 5 star rating! :)", "McGibs30Jul 17, 2019 at 4:09 PM\nWow\n\nThis is incredible and a must have!

Our immediately work in the current phase is to look into more optimizations so we can further incorporate more enemies as well as looking into more additional content :)", "iG33k_0utJun 27, 2019 at 9:12 PM\n5 Stars for FREEDOM\n\nThe quest version is way shorter then the pcvr version ,buuuuuuuut I'll gladly trade off cords for levels!

Do allow us to share with you the issues. Original campaign missions uses the current PCVR maps, which are not suitable at all. They are far too large and causes FPS drops, which is a very stringent requirement for the Quest to ensure quality experiences. As a result, we actually had to create maps from ground up instead.

Infact I read his review and figured it would not apply to me. I'm 5'7\" and when I jump the game always makes me slide (a lot of the times to my death), because it must think I'm bending down to slide . To counter it, I have to turn sliding off which takes away a lot of the fun, and ironically, the first challenge is to kill 3 ppl while sliding. Otherwise everything looks and feels real good.

Then the game crashed towards end of level 1 on my first 2 tries. I let my son have a go next, hes a little short (1.4m) and the game is unplayable because it just keeps trying to do a slide as it assumes player is crouching. Theee is no height setting in the game to account for this. So u too now, its been unplayable.\n\nUpdate: At the moment Ive tried to get through mission 1 , 7 times and its crashed out every time. The game seems a lot of fun if I could actually play it. For quite an intense game the motion sickness is not that bad, I struggle with a few games but had no problems with this one.
