This is Amazing!\n\nFirst impression:\n\nHave to say i did not really consider this game when i first got a VR headset. I've played many of the major FPS's available on quest + Boneworks, Zero Caliber and Stormland with link, but left this one out. Until now. AND MAN! was i surprised \n\nThis game, if you Even remotely like guns this is for you, you dont have to be a gun buff to get it either. What caught my eye was the perfect execution using GUNS in VR. A quest game with actual gun physics? Wow. Reloading Feels great, every aspect of adjusting weapons also feels natural. It reminds me alot of Pavlov's way of reloading interaction with guns + the physics side of Boneworks.\n\nThere's soooo many guns to choose from, both modern guns, WW2 and concept guns.\nAnd every gun can have attachements, you can make some really funny looking guns maxing out on attachements. You can also but modern attachements on WW2 guns aswell. Plus the weapons can be upraded themselves both in capacit and, firepower\n\nThe game has several modes and levels with different styles of popup targets, some are moving towards you, some are static, some are shooting at you etc. You Will get rewarded for headshots, faster reloading etc.\n\nThere's also a Sandbox Mode, allowing you to test every gun and every attachement in the game, with a shooting range, and the ability to spawn every item in the game and place it wherever and target practice on.\n\nIts all about making cash buying new weapons and unlocking new ones. Did i mention the graphics look great? Particularly the guns themselves have satisfying reflections and look like the real deal. This is only a first impression for me as I've only played it for a couple of hours. But its seems like there's alot of content here, levels and challenges with increased difficulty, also a creepy zombie mode with moving targets. Will definately keep me coming back \n\nI can safely recommend it! \n\nHelpful | 325", "Xx_Connor69420_xXJul 22 at 3:59 PM\nLots of fun but it can be better\n\nThis game is a lot of fun but it can be better. Some things I would like to see are\n\n1: more guns. There is already a good amount of guns in the game but I would like to see more\n\n2: online multiplayer, this would be cool because a pvp mode or a co op mode would be a lot of fun\n\n3: more ways to move\n\n4: more maps, and game modes. The selection of maps and game modes is good but i would love more maps to be added.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I love the gun customization feature, it is truest amazing. Once in sandbox mode I made a gun with I think like 9 grenade launchers on it and it was amazing.\n\nHelpful | 14", "Alex_DrakeJul 1 at 8:51 PM\nGreat game 11/10\n\nI love the games and mechanics. It let's you really load any weapon manually and I love games that let you do that. Also can the m1887 be added? Edit: wow the dev's actually added a lever action gun idk if it was bc I asked or because they were already going to anyways thank dev's but can we also get some LMGS like the M249 maybe?\n\nHelpful | 24", "LuigiRocks9517 days ago\nMore Sound/details!\n\nThis game overall is fantastic! The graphics are great and gameplay is fantastic and there are plenty of things to do and explore. But there are a few things I would love to see. Along with all of these in general, I would love to see it be more like H3VR (Hot Dogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades). I want to be able to do things like Fan the Hammer on revolvers, gunspinning/slinging, putting the magazine into the guns in weird ways (hands free reload). Another feature that would be fantastic (and awesome) is a time slowing tool. I want to see the bullet fly! And can we get an actual gun holster? That would be a minor detail that would be cool. Walking as an option is a must too.\n\nAnd finally, more dynamic sounds. The sounds that are currently in the game are exciting, but some guns share the same sounds as another, making them more boring overtime. Basically what I want is REAL sound, like the sound of reloading a glock in real life. I almost forgot! Can you add more guns? Like RPGs, SWAT, and others? And after all of this, I am leaving this with a swift 5 stars and a great job to the developers. You all did great!\n\n\n\n(Can we get 3D models? That would be WAAAY better than the cardboard target people)\n\nHelpful | 3", "scubaduJul 19 at 5:27 PM\nWay better than I thought.\n\nI was hesitant to purchase this game as I thought it would be boring! Well I finally gave it a try since I had the option of getting a refund. But now it's my favorite go to game as the graphics are pretty good and the weapons feel very real, minus the recoil. I've always seemed to have a difficult time shooting hand guns in real life and now I've found out why thanks to this game and without a doubt I'm very pleased with the game all they way. Kudos to the game makers!\n\nHelpful | 7", "Ollinnature8 hours ago\nLots of variety, no rules\n\nEndless customization with fun game modes. The standard stationary shooting is great to improve your aim, action is fun and adds an extra level of skill and variety, zombie mode is nerve racking as they take very little damage and require headshots for a quick kill but the fact that they start coming at you makes you forget to aim, and finally we have sandbox mode that is really fun to mess around in\n\nHelpful | 0", "Recoil_RiseA day ago\nBest VR Game for Guns\n\nI love guns, so I bought this on sale. I was impressed. Good game and I played for hours. You could add these things:\n\n1. Walking (not teleporting)\n\n2. More guns (iconic guns)\n\n3. Customizable guns (paint, stickers, etc. Like in the PC version)\n\n4. The menu in Sandbox is too sensitive and I keep on accidentally spawning in barrels. Please fix this.\n\n5. Give each gun their unique sound. Some guns will have each others same sound its boring after hearing it so often.\n\nOverall it is a great, satisfying, entertaining game. Worth the price. Good job devs. \n\nHelpful | 0", "Rainman90020 days ago\nGreat, but not perfect ..\n\nThe gunplay is pretty great in this game. The handguns feel and handle great, and when you get good you feel awesome for sure. Nothing better than nailing a tactical reload and hitting all your targets.\n\nThe downside of this game is that the two handed weapons dont handle well, they are pretty difficult to aim, and regularly lose tracking for whatever reason, and that does not happen in my other games. I hope that it can be fixed as it makes the two handed guns frustrating to use.\n\nHelpful | 4", "N1tr0BladeJun 20 at 11:00 AM\nGame is great for those who love guns\n\nThe game is good but I have some gun ideas to add\n1. A double barrel shotgun\n2. Some more snipers ( like a 22.\n3. Make it where you have a choice to press a to load it or load it manually like actually loading it\n4. Some more railings or attachments\nAnd thats my ideas for now\nAnd fix the glitch with the ars where you can remove the stock becuase I put the pro skeleton stock on it and it just glitches out\nIts shootable but the grab circle keep popping up which makes it glitch out\n\nHelpful | 19", "360VRcreator15 days ago\nIf you love guns - this is a must have\n\nAmazing interaction, good gun play and physics.\n\nCouple comments.. some people are wanting 3D human targets, I'm good with the flat cutouts, the name of the the app is \"GUN CLUB\" pretty sure thats the point, its intended to be a CLUB experience, we are not here to shoot up folks. ;-)\n\nSecond,\nFeature request / fix: Hand-gun grip physics, its fun shooting guns I already own, however my muscle memory aim was off, on the elevation. then I realized when looking over the iron sights I always have to lower the barrel, the grip on the actual guns are far more vertical than the virtual-grip angle. This seems like an easy fix. when grabbing a handgun, the oculus touch controller angle should mimic the actual gun grip angle. either by default, or as a check-box option. Please.\n\nHelpful | 3", "ZerotwoGamerApr 7 at 1:19 PM\nThis Game Is God Tier but i like to see\n\nthis Game is AMAZING God-like but I feel lt need some of these things.\n\n1. add more Guns like AR and Shotguns (my choice maybe an M4A1 or M16 and for shotguns an AA12).\n\n2. add Walking the teleporting is hard for players that are used to walking in VR.\n\n3. add more game mode the are not many game mode so it gets boring.\n\n4. more custom guns like SWAT, FBI, SAS, GIGN, GSG 9, or SAT\n\nThat my review I LOVE the game I'm hyped for the next update.\n\nHelpful | 533", "Tolien11 days ago\nAs good as it gets\n\nGreat game, (or call it simulator) as I have been in the army and used some of the weapons here in real life I must say the realism is great, even though it is a game and to make it fun, they have elements that goes beyond realisme to make the game more fun and playable.\n\n+ lots of weapons\n+ lots of upgrades\n+ you can actually train to become better marksman with handguns.\n\n- the hands can be somewhat of, ruining your round a few times\n\n-the sights can be tricky to use, especially sniper weapons.\n\n- No chill out on the mountain long range track.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Dqburdick11 days ago\nWow.\n\nThis was one of the first titles that I purchased on Quest. And it, to this day, remains my favorite, and heres why.\nThe sheer variety of firearms you can choose from are amazing. There are a few I would recommend adding (Ruger 10/22 maybe? Its kind of iconic, along with some LMGs). I am somewhat of a firearms enthusiast, though I do not own one myself. The sandbox mode makes for hours of entertainment, however there are some complaints that I have.\n1: add the ability to rotate objects on the\nY axis. This would make objects such as the plate be more shootable.\n2: add paper splatter burst targets. These would make for more fun.\n3: EXPAND THE BUILT IN RANGE. with most of the current rifle scopes they can zero into 300m, even though the range has only 35m.\nThank you for reading this review.\n\nHelpful | 1", "theeagleeyedsniper10 days ago\nLove this game\n\nThis game is all you could ask for as a firing range setting. The recoil of all the guns are almost identical to every gun in the game. There are only 2 really big problems I have with the game. The first is the knives and how unrealistic the throwing mechanic is. I have trained with real throwing knives and they can only go about 25 yards while still being effective, but the knives in this game can be thrown across the map without any movement needed. The last bit of criticism I have is about the modern bayonet on the Vector. Dont get me wrong, seeing 3 bayonets on a vector looks hilarious, but isnt practical. Other than those two minor flaws, this game is one for the history books.\n\nHelpful | 0", "RobZero112 days ago\nSimple\n\nThis game should not on paper be this good, explaining it to someone and it sounds shallow... but its great\n\nMaybe its the physics of the guns or the gradual ramping up of levels.\n\nFew months into quest and have all the top grossing / recommended games but VR gun club has me always returning and logging soo many hours now.\n\nHelpful | 1", "slangblade11x9 days ago\nDidnt know what to expect. No regurts.\n\nThis. Game. Is. The. Heat.\n\nIf you enjoy shooting guns as much as I do, this is the game for you. Range time, target practice, zombies, shoot house scenarios, allied/nazi scenarios, this game is just too cool. I didnt know what to expect at such a decent and fair price point, but this is probably my favorite game on the oculus so far. Its hard to beat how solid this game is. Shoot anything, anytime and setup any gun with any gear layout... I just cant even love this game enough.\n\nJust buy it and go shoot something. \n\nHelpful | 0", "blueJ4ykbJul 17 at 8:16 PM\nGunclub Feedback\n\nGunclub vr is a fun game and I absolutely reccomend it.

Maybe a speed loader for the revolver.\n\n\n\nOverall, great game and I reccomend it. Although, unless it gets better modes, sounds, movement, models, effects, im paying another $1200 for a new pc and H3VR because H3VR has all of those things.\n\nHelpful | 3", "PaleoFossil255 hours ago\nAiming can be a bit iffy\n\nI love this game! The way the guns handle, reload and fire is increadible. However, I can't say I'm a fan of the aiming in this game and I also feel that your arsenal is too small. I also don't like the wood cutouts that they use instead of actual models. Like they're not that bad but just underwhelming.\n\nHelpful | 0", "LikaNapalm2 days ago\nMaybe the gear's issue\n\nMy only problem with this game is that when you aim down sights like you should the headset maybe loses the \"firing hand\" controller or tries to lock the stock of the weapon into your shoulder and this way the aiming 2 handed weapons feels pretty weird\n\nOtherwise if you're a gun nut, when it comes to attachments, it's pretty customizable\n\nHelpful | 1", "Imbeaser4272 days ago\nGreat game 100% worth buying!\n\nI really enjoy playing this game and think that anybody who enjoys shooting would enjoy playing this game. There are a few things that I think could be done better in the user interface but only in certain spots the rest borders on flawless. In the sandbox area the movement at least for me isn't as intuitive as I feel like it could be simple joystick controls that let you walk would be ideal as opposed to the teleporting which doesn't always go as smoothly as you hope. As far as regular gameplay goes and if I were to rate this game based solely on that it would be five stars for sure but I do have to take all things into consideration when writing a review. The user interface for reloading, cocking, aiming and shooting is so good. I should note that I play this on the Oculus quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "CommunistDogeJul 18 at 8:49 PM\nGreat but H3VR ruined it for me.\n\nOk this game is great and I love all of the weapons and gunplay.The only problem is after using ALVR to play H3VR i cant go back to this.If you have a VR ready PC please get H3VR instead but otherwise this is a great alternative.I wish the devs of this game would add more guns.\n\nHelpful | 3", "iosnerd3 days ago\nFun and satisfying; difficult controls\n\nThis was one of the first games I bought for the Oculus Quest and it is incredibly well done. Its fun to play once you get some of the realistic control movements down; like two handed aiming and reloading. I really like how they capture the sights and sounds of a real weapons range and worked to provide realistic movements for loading magazines, safety toggling, and adjusting attachments. The only major issue I have had is trying to aim a rifle with a large scope is nearly impossible in VR. Unless you get the hand controllers positioned just right, and even then its difficult to be accurate.\n\nOverall its a really fun and close to realistic way to experience an indoor gun range with a wide selection of weapons and attachments.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Diamond_Pugs18 days ago\nNot just a shooting range!\n\nI wasn't interested in this game at all, but it was on sale, and on the forums everyone was recommending it so I decided to pull the trigger, and I'm glad I did. This game is way more than just a shooting range. It feels more like those old arcade shooting games like House of the Dead, but better since it has a ton of realistic weapons and mods, more levels, zombies, nazies, terrorists, and all with the full immersion of VR, and in between shooting levels you will spend hours customizing your guns making your perfect, and sometimes over the top, weapon.\n\nIt is a buy on PCVR and a must buy on the Quest.\n\nHelpful | 0", "udo.nink13 days ago\nAttention to detail\n\nWow, somebody has paid a lot attention to detail here. I am not a gun buddy and do not prefer ego shooters, but it caught my attention, made me curious, and I must say, it is a bazooka among guns. It has a lot of engineering touch which I really love and appreciate.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DiggyP89Jul 6 at 4:06 PM\nLots of guns and attachments\n\nI got this game thinking it would be ok and was impressed by how much fun it is.\n\nThere is a campaign where you beat levels and get money as a reward to buy guns and attachments even upgrade your bullets.\n\nThe targets shoot back at you and there are zombie levels and the zombie cut outs come after you which I really enjoy playing the zombie levels.\n\nYou can get stocks clips rails sights scopes laser sights under barrel attachments\n\nSo many guns to choose from pistols shot guns sub machine guns assault rifles sniper rifles\n\nI was blown away by how many guns there are and how much you can do to upgrade them.\n\nAlso you can stand or sit while playing there are settings to accommodate for sitting in a chair.\n\nReloading mechanics are realistic as they should be it seems like the main focus of this game is the guns and learning how to reload each of them is fun. You can even switch to single shot burst and full auto on some guns.\n\nI would definitely recommend buying this game\n\nHelpful | 4", "BARRUKHASHEMJul 21 at 2:07 PM\nGreat Fun, Nice Graphics & Enjoyable\n\nGee Wizz this game is Amazing ( so far), its never crashed like other games, it doesn't over heat your oculus quest and is pure fun. Guns very realistic, and you can go for speed or accuracy, head shots or blast all the barrels  well worth every penny. Only fault is theres no multi player pvp sadly. However its one of my best purchases\n\nHelpful | 2", "HamtimetwoJul 18 at 9:14 PM\nLots of fun, but some small issues.\n\nThis game is great, and I definitely recommend you buy it if you like guns. This was my first VR game i ever bought, and it is so much fun, and I think the sandbox mode is my favorite, being able to have all the weapons and attachments, along with being able to set up a huge target range. Sometimes I find myself blankly shooting and reloading guns endlessly, until I eventually toss them to the side and get some new ones. However, I do have some small things that I would like implemented.\n\n#1: Recoil. I think it would make the immersion a lot better of the gun had a bit of recoil. Not a ton, but just enough to make it feel realistic.\n\n#2: Better sound effects. Some of the sound effects (especially the pump action shotguns) dont feel very great, they sound very low quality. Just going over the sounds and seeing which needs to be updated and which can stay the same could easily fix this problem.\n\n#3: Better reloads. Whenever you need to send the bolt forward after inserting a new magazine/clip, you have to manually pull it back. While not huge, I think doing something like being able to send the bolt forward without have to manually pull it back, (Maybe when you move the thumb stick up after inserting a new magazine/clip) then that would be wonderful.\n\nOverall, I have to give it a 9/10, mainly because I can look past most of these, and they would just be a quality of life change, and not something vital. Definitely recommend you buy it.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Connacemox13 hours ago\nFun, fun and more fun!\n\nI just love shooting games. In this one you have such a big gun selection of all kinds and customization available, that you can play for hours without getting bored. What I love about this is the reloading mechanism. Ejecting the clip with the thumb stick is so much fun!\n\nYou rank higher as you go and earn money to upgrade your guns or buy new ones. Prepare to spend quite some time here, exploring what is available and costumazing your gun the way you want it.\n\nTargets are good, although I would prefer if they were more realistic.\n\nHelpful | 0", "skydarkblue23 days ago\nGreat game new user to quest\n\nI tried to use other gun games to start and the moving around gave me motion sickness. Not wanting to give up I tried this to get my VR legs and shooting down. By far one of the best experiences in shooting on the quest. Even if you are shooting at targets the adrenaline is there especially if you fumble a reload. Well worth the money. After a couple days of this game I was able to start playing onward for longer periods of time. Great job\n\nHelpful | 1", "ItsRainingNansMay 25 at 5:07 AM\nVery epic BUT\n\nOkay this game is a 4/5 . Very good. Although, I would like to see some changes...\n\n1) Add dynamic movement for people who aren't used to teleport (like me)\n\n2) Multi-player would be very nice. Pvp like in Pavlov would make this game so much more fun. Or even just some sort of co op would be epic.\n\n3) Add more props or game mechanics to the sandbox mode. I would very much like to see sandbox be more like gmod.\n\nHelpful | 42", "Mattplus097 days ago\nDone Buying Quest Software!\n\nI also own this on PSVR, I'm glad about that because it's a great title, but I'm done buying titles for the Quest.

However, emptying the magazine by racking the slide fifteen times does not lead to the slide locking open as it should (it does empty the magazine, which is accurate).\n- I haven't found a way to manually lock the slide open in game, or actuate the slide release without tugging on the slide itself.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Callum.Hilton16 days ago\nJust perfect\n\nThis is game should cost twice the much it costs because I would happily pay more because its so fun the only problem is the lack of some guns like lmgs but the devs are adding stuff all the time so you earned the 5 stars\n\nHelpful | 0", "orges.zeneli.16 days ago\nSuper fun but..\n\nIts really fun but there is a problem.

Didn't think that shooting at a gunrange would be this much fun. This game shows how good a polished gun mechanics can feel like in a game.\nVR Gunclub seem to have focused on the most important areas,\n1.the feel of firing, The tracking is excellent, guns line up well and it feels good aiming downs sight. It's very responsive and feels great. 2. A good selection of weapons and 3.a surprising amount of variety in game modes. This is much more than just shooting at a simple gunrange. There are targets with health and different damage areas, hostage scenarios, carnival shooting and even a zombies and more.\nThe area of the game I feel could need more work is the weapon customization. Maybe its a gripe of mine the customization isn't as complex or crazy as some other games. You can still put atleast 6 attachments on a single pistol, so its not that limiting - but it would be nice with some more rail types for example, like siderails, the ability to place more than one attachment per rail if the rail is long enough. Choose between more than one type of laser sight. Having alot of different scopes is very nice, unfortunately none of their zoom qualities seem to be different. They feel like the same two scopes with different skins.\n\nA few bugs for \"The Binary mill\" worth notice\n*The silencers have just disapeared from selection from several of my weapons. Like the TMP, G18 and EF88(AUG).\n*When pressing the scope to change the distance of the zoom, it changes nothing. I dont know if im missing something.\n*I upgraded to the speedloader with the starting shotgun. Tried it out and later detached it. Afterwards I could not load the shotgun with shells regularly. Got a error sound when reaching for the ammo. Even after restarting, had to change and use the second customization slot for the weapon instead.\n*Not being able to put the bayonette attatchment at the very front end of the rifles.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Motymor20 days ago\nSurprisingly great\n\nThis game is surprisingly fun. I'm not too into guns or anything but buying and customising your guns is really fun. All the modes are cool and the sandbox is fun to mess around in.

I don't believe I need to say much more. The rest of this review is going to be a suggestion log of sorts. It is for the devs to see some things that I thought of. None of these are game breakers, just minor suggestions.\n\n1. MAJOR SUGGESTION: A prestige system, where you restart your rank, but not your guns.\n2. Can you guys (or gals) make an option to turn off the ability to take out a magazine by just pulling on it?\n2. The SW(287?) Revolver has a good reload, but I have noticed the speed loader is a little finnicky. Sometimes i will try to load it, and it looks like there aren't any bullets in it, but there are (they are invisible) and I have wasted time jamming the speed loader against the cylinder this isn't game breaking, just annoying.\n3. Can you make guns (particularly the shotguns, specifically the trench shotgun) have an option to be shorter. I have shorter arms, and it gets annoying to eject a shell every time I want to put two hands on the gun.\n4. Rather large problem, on the allied action course (20?) When you go into the building, on the top floor, the enemies are invisible, so you literally have to shoot blindly\n5. More guns! (Of course)\n6. More ways to move (i.e. walking)\n\n\nThank you for reading this.

I have probably only played maybe 3-4 hours of it so far but I definitely keep wanting to come back to unlock more levels and money to buy more guns.

The gun selection is great (although I hope to see more guns come in, in the future) and the ranges (the killing targets portion) is awesome. Some things I would like to see: more diversity in the gun sounds. Maybe the sounds of the actual gun being shot? I notice some guns have similar sounds, probably to save time or money, and I'm just the type of person that notices. Theres differences, but some sound very similar. So sounds from the actual guns you're shooting, would be awesome. Some sort of multiplayer would be great, even if that's just a hub shooting range where we can hit the targets and show off our gun customizations. Over all, great game.

For example, akimbo weapons, sidearms, rocket launchers and or actual grenade launchers, and explosives like c4 should be added. The reason I say pistols, sidearms, or secondaries is because you have two spots for weapons but you dont use them both. Maybe adding another weapon like a pistol to that loadout can change that? Also, Im seeing the game choose the wrong spot to grab; I can tell the oculus controller to grab the stock of a weapon and it would grab the grenade launcher or something I have attached to it. In conclusion, I would recommend this game to friends, but I would like a little bit more from this game.\n\nHelpful | 2", "rexosaurusrexJul 8 at 5:20 PM\nPerfect Break Time Game\n\nWhen I'm busy and need to take a 15 minute break, this game is perfect for that, because I could jump in then out of it.

No seriously if you are plugged in and need to do something set an alarm it is frighteningly easy to lose track of time doing just one more.\n-amazing one handed mechanics that do work on 2 handed guns. Less realistic, but combats a flaw that could have been fatal otherwise. Pistols feel so good in this game. Even after you have the \"best pistols\" stat wise you will buy all the others, because they are genuinely really fun to use.\n\nCon's\n- nothing is explained well in the options. There is a good amount you can customize, but it is all kinda trial and a whole lot of error finding out what works well for you.\n- using guns 2 handed is awful. Maybe there is a magic option setting I just can not find, or combo of settings... but as it is using any gun 2 handed is worse then one handed. You can't move them like you would a real gun and they just feel wonky. Also God help you if you equipped anything near where you grab.... Yes game the middle of a firefight is the exact time I want to remove something on my gun, no I am not just trying to use a two handed grip.\n- snipers get the short end of the stick because of the 2 handed issue, which is a shame because the scope mechanics are really nice. Though the fact the came has you set your zero range on a hitscan weapon and just makes the scope show the incorrect aiming point is kinda the worst way that could have been handled. Either have adjustable sights and realistic bullet physics or just make scopes always zero'd in.

There is an Allied mode that puts you in a war-simulation, and it has a teleport system that lets you move around without feeling sick. There are so many types of guns and they all feel different!!! The attention to detail is incredible, you can put upgrades on the guns and the changes are subtle but you can definitely feel the difference.

Wrong-handed support sweetens the deal for me even more due to my being left eye dominant and having some sort of support for shouldering a stock only helps with the realism immersion even more.\n\nI would like to see a few things added:\n\n1. The Bren Gun's carry handle should be movable from side to side--the better to use as a forward grip. That feels far more natural than using the bipod as a forearm to fire from the shoulder as the bipod--even when folded--is a bit far to use as a forward grip when firing from the shoulder.\n\n2. A belt-fed Machine Gun category should be added as that would add something new in the form of belt reloading and barrel change procedures to the game. My suggestions for said category would be:\n\n- M249 (classic LMG everyone knows about)\n- PKM (another classic; different in that it feeds from the right side)\n- HK21(more unusual design w/select fire capability; reloads from a bottom feed instead of a top feed)\n\n\nCan't wait to see what updates you have in store for GCVR.

I'd love more control, more realism, more complexity, even if optional.\nFor example:\n- I'd love reloading to have a realism mode requiring the press of the mag release button.\n- I'd also love to be able to inspect the chamber to see if a round is chambered without ejecting the bullet.\n- Some weapons lack their safety option.\n- Magazines being guided in while reloading kills the immersion.\n- infinite magazines feel weird. Give me two mags and a bag of bullets, with the capacity to load up bullets into mags manually and I'll be happy.\n- give me the capacity to take cover without using the incredibly awkward teleportation tool.\n- time-free survival mode would be awesome.\n- as a 3d artist and animator, it would be lovely if there was the option for community-made guns to fill in the void of weapons that aren't there yet (I'd so love myself a mosin-nagant, or a type 99, or a browning, or an AA12, or... Well, you get the gist).\n\nNow, despite all those irks that I have as a gun geek, this game is quite lovely and I've spent hours upon hours playing it, sometimes until the sun rises again after a night of playing it. I've spent so much time perfecting my reload technique I've forgotten how it feels to run out of ammo. I've messed with the upgrade system so much to try weird configurations that I'm pretty sure I made my own tactical nightmare at least a dozen times.

Beating your high score and paying for upgrades / weapons with your winnings is always fun, although not quite sure on the longevity of the game yet. The various modes are fun so far, although theyre all very much variations on the same format it seems.\n\nSo why 3 stars?\n\nI do think the game seems to assume you have a prior knowledge of guns - its not particularly intuitive or helpful in explaining an awful lot; took me bloody ages to work out how to reload the shotgun. The opening tutorials also feel like they could do with some fine tuning to introduce the game slower and hell to familiarise you with the use of the various weaponry.\n\nAdditional information on each gun would be great - how to operate/reload/best use. Again, the game thinks youre already a gun nut and needs no hand holding, but I certainly couldve used it. Would love to have clearer tutorials / videos within the game that explains the upgrade tree too. What each component does, what certain upgrades offer vs. other options youre given. Im buying upgrades and half the time Ive got no idea (aside from obvious things like mag and ammo boosts) what they do.\n\nThe game also has a strong Americuh! vibe, with very Alpha male (Duke Nukem style) VO when you do something like load your weapon perfectly.

I was going to request a refund bur persevered as I really wanted to experience, what according to reviews, was an excellent game. Fortunately after rebooting my Quest and reloading on the 4th time I was able to progress through to a few ranges and from that point on (touch wood) it has remained stable. I also deactivated auto hand tracking, that might have helped. The game is really good and I'm glad I didn't give up. It is very satisfying to improve on your previous scores and then add modifications to your weapon to enhance performance. The sandbox is another great feature, time flies when you're playing with the enormous amount of configurations. If it wasn't for my early experience it would be 5 stars. After reading through reviews it seems others have also experienced the crashes, hopefully devs can resolve them and ensure stability.\n\nHelpful | 0", "RusskiBearJul 15 at 3:51 PM\nGreat game, but could have improvements\n\nFirst of all the game is great, and if you have the money this is one of the essentials for the quest. However, a couple improvements/qualify of life additions id like to propose.\n\n1. Option to remove tracers. The smokey trails behind bullets really throw me off, and I find myself relying on adjusting my aim by using the trails unintentionally,which ruins some of the experience. Would be nice if we had an option to turn them off.\n2. Option to enable/disable performance mode manually on sandbox mode. It gets very annoying having to constantly disable the performance mode which keeps turning itself on and making the game a blurry mess. I can't shoot past 5 meters when everything turns into a blob because performance mode turned on for the 5th time in 2 mins. Reaaally bugs the crap out of me, and limits the enjoyment of sandbox mode.\n3. Compact guns need better 2 handed controls. Currently trying to use the p90 or any compact smg is impossible 2 handed as the barrel starts pointing in every direction on the slightest movement. Virtual stock doesnt help much with this issue.\n4. Slightly increased recoil. This one is more of a suggestion than a problem with the game, but I would love to see an option for different simulated levels of recoil. Currently any gun in the game is practically a laser, hold the trigger down and the recoil of a full auto AKM is practically non existent.\n\nOther than that, a great game, spent the most time on this title than any other on my quest. Would highly recommend.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Exiled_UnxverseApr 1 at 2:47 PM\nIncredible. A few things missing...\n\nI have had this game for ages and it is a blast. The mechanics are pretty cool however in sandbox you can phase through walls which crashed my game a few times, the fact some very basic weapons are missing hurts me. Some basic weapons that you NEED to add: M4A1/M16, M14 and SCAR-L. Some not so basic ones: New Model Army 1886, Winchester, Serbu Shotgun. Optional weapons: M60, MK48, M249, Machinegewehr41 and a mini gun if possible (I know a mini gun is insane but it will be lots of fun in sandbox.) [If you will add the mini gun, make it incredibly expensive. I'm talking millions.] If you add the very basic weapons, it will be a dead straight 5 stars.

For example, there is no fully automatic shotgun or pistol, and the game has mostly pistols. There is also a large amount of glitches/bugs. Trying to grab some guns on certain parts with one hand and letting go with the other will just make your hand fall off until you let go of the gun. I do give the game props for being the first of its kind on the quest, but the glitches and lack of content is a big bummer. Along with the lack of customization, for example you cannot put a rail on a rail (Im guessing for performance) and the system for putting stuff on in general in incredibly janky. The stock system is also very confusing and infuriating. The stock system basically boils down to - put gun near shoulder - gun moves less when you move your hands. The problem with this though is that the stocks or your shoulder hitbox is HUGE, which makes it so the gun will seemingly suddenly stop aiming the way you want it to, and the tutorial doesnt tell you anything about this system. In general this game needs more content, more bug/ glitch fixes, more customization, more ease of use, and to explain things, or to at least make them clear so they dont have to figure it out on their own, especially when it is as infuriating as it is. Please take some of this advice, devs. At the current point this game just seems unfinished.\n\nHelpful | 2", "Raptorclaw_14Jun 19 at 5:38 PM\nBest game ever!\n\nThe gameplay is amazing and i like the fact that you can play sandbox and missions\n\nHelpful | 0", "DIPDIA-QMay 21 at 1:22 PM\nShooting in the sandbox\n\nI enjoyed this game more than I thought I would.

The realistic fireaems and paper targets make it seem like and actual range, which is super immersive. The ladder levelling system is a touch on the easy side, but it teaches what a FPS can do in VR. There's no story, just difficulty progression and arena unlocks. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in VR FPSs but without any experience. Not that veterans won't enjoy this, but as someone who's played a bunch of VR FPSs you might find it a touch repetitive and boring. It is very repetitive for a new player and I love every second of it.

Shooting a pop-up gallery of random wooden cutouts (humans), shooting wooden cutouts of zombies (not humans), shooting wooden cutouts of Nazis (not humans), and shooting wooden cutouts of Nazi zombies (because of course there is). The challenge isn't in the humans (and Nazis) hitting you, it's your own aim. All the wooden cutouts of humans (and Nazis) couldn't hit water if they were in the Challenger Deep. It also doesn't let you take more than one weapon into a level. The weapon selection is missing a few key items like an SSG, S&W-Esque revolvers, and miniguns.

As you complete challenges, they progressively get more difficult. And, for the main sections, the progression is based on weapon type.

The overall progression is measured in army rank. You start at private and work your way up.

All weapons and add ones can be tried in the sandbox, which has totally customizable targets. The targets are cardboard people, and zombies, but it is totally fine, they still shoot back. The WWII challenges are fun as well.\n\nI would like to see some updates with more content. There is a lot to do, but I always want more. The best thing I can say about this game is that I play it all the time. If I am ever in a quandary about what to play, I play Gun Club\n\nHelpful | 1", "t1mok1ngApr 26 at 4:11 PM\nA Wonderful Surprise\n\nGun Club VR was not a game I expected to love half as much as I do. It might look like just another dull target shooter - but what it lacks in variety of gameplay, it more than delivers in quality.\n\nThere is a huge selection of guns and attachments on offer here - each excellently modelled and featuring unique methods to load and operate. Half the fun is getting to know a new weapon and becoming better with it as you gain confidence in aiming and reloading.\n\nOnce the muscle memory starts to click, every action works with deeply satisfying accuracy. Dropping an empty mag, inserting a fresh one from your belt and pulling back the slide feels great every time. The whole game relies on these simple mechanics to hold it up and somehow it pulls it off.\n\nThat might just be because of the constant feeling of reward. Each level is short but will earn you cash that you can spend in the store. Its great for dipping in 5 minutes at a time, but youll probably find yourself constantly wanting one more round. And theres a ton of levels here that get progressively harder, you wont run out of things to do anytime soon.\n\nHelpful | 1", "mr.awsJul 5 at 8:57 PM\nGood\n\nIts pretty good\n\nHelpful | 0", "CertifiedTideJun 1 at 4:14 PM\n\nAmazing game but PLEASE add walking option instead of teleporting!!

(One of the funnest games?) Ive ever played on my VR and it comes up close with beat saber and Vader immortal. Its fun to try and earn more guns in war attachments for yourself and its pretty much endless fun and a lot of the levels are similar but at the same time different in a way. The Stability with scopes is kind of janky but I mean, you dont have a stock, what do you expect?

I discovered the hardcore more too late and have now restarted the game playing only on hardcore without amy upgrades, except for a flashlight when required. I love everything about the game.

I know you can go to sandbox and set up some targets and stuff, but sometimes I just want to jump into the game and shoot randomly at targets without having to pick a level every few minutes. So a normal \"mission\" where targets and hostage situations keep popping up would be awesome, maybe with an easy, medium, hard toggle.\n\n2) When you have completed all of the missions eg 40/40 for pistols, and you replay level 1, tou are automaticly returned to level 40,and have to click back 37 times to get to level 2. It would be cool if there was a setting to move through the levels chronologically again, without creating a new profile or anything.

However, I'm glad I bought the game again because ther are many settings you can enable to get a true VR range shooter like H3VR.\n\nGuns are super realistic with every gun having it's own cocking mechanism and safety button and even different reloads. The actual addition to attachments is also what makes the game a time passer as I always come to the sandbox mode to just chill out and experiment with different weapons.\n\nThis game by no means is perfect but it's the nearest to H3VR when it comes to realism. As of right now there are about 50 weapons and 74 if you count the duplicates with different skins. I'm really hoping for a huge update where they can add at least 10 more weapons.\n\nOverall, the game needs tweaking in the settings before playing but once you get everything configured then everything else will be a breeze and you'll find yourself coming back to this game a lot to pass time.\n\nAlso, this is a great game to show a first time VR user without them feeling nauseated and doing something too face paced. This is a must have especially for the price and if you are at all interested just a tiny bit in VR shooters then definitely add this to your library.

It's almost like a collection of mini games in a way. But having had it on my Quest for about a year now I can tell you that it earns its price tag. It's the kind of thing you'll find yourself dipping into pretty frequently and finding more to enjoy. There's an amazing range of realistically recreated weapons and lots of different modes to work through. It's the only Quest game I know of with realistic reloading. The addition of the \"sandbox\" area with the last update was a major improvement. This new addition is a no-fail playspace where you can spawn in any weapon you want and just mess around with it, shooting targets etc.\n\nOne thing I would like to change: like lots of VR shooters, this game shows you the path of each shot as though every bullet were a tracer round.

Trying to do something as simple as navigate the menu on your wrist in the warehouse or trying to attach a weapon mod, just seem very clunky and unresponsive. I understand it's VR and you're going for realism. But using the joystick to move up and down a menu would have been a lot easier then trying to use your VR finger. Also the aiming is horrible. You can being look down a sight dead on your target but somehow your gun fires far left, right, high and low. Maybe with a special gun controller or something, this would work better.

The customizable guns where amazing and the reload mechanics where great too! There where different modes like zombies, action, and target practice! But I do have two problems with the game as of right now. The movement is limited to only teleporting, so if the devs, could add an option to where you can choose to walk smoothly or teleport. Also for the revolver and shotgun the reloading doesnt seem as satisfying as the other guns, there should be an option in the settings to reload the revolver and shotgun realistically, or how it normally is.

There are only 3 gun sounds for like 50 different weapons, and many of the parts to the guns can not be interacted with. For example, the rear sight on the BAR can not be flipped up or adjusted. There are problems with weapon scaling, too. The Ppsh 41's width is way too flat; it looks like it was ran over by a T34. The Stg44 is much too long, etc. If you shoot the paper target enough in the sandbox shooting range, bullet holes begin to disappear! I understand that the Oculus Quest is not a very powerful workhorse when it comes to specs, but it really shows in this game. Attachments are unrealistic and feel more like a gimmick than something that aids in accuracy. Most attachments are downright incorrect, such as the C79's scope crossheirs for an example. The developers do not update nearly enough, and it seems like there are times when they forget about this game altogether despite it being one of the most popular games on the Quest. It would be a lie to say that I haven't had fun playing this game, and although there are a few weapons that feel genuine (such as the Uzi), this game does not come close to replacing H3VR. If you REALLY want a shooting game like this, I'd recommend it, but just barely.

It's annoying when they're sideways and it takes me out of the immersion. The action game is annoying because you can't move around freely and that takes me out of the immersion too.

Almost\n\nI got this game mostly for the gun simulation side of it, and its really good for that. The sandbox range is awesome and has many targets. There is also a wide variety of guns, about 73. The different missions are also a lot of fun, especially the sniper missions. The gun operation is very realistic and includes stuff like using the safeties, flip sights, magazines, adding attachments, and changing the zeros for the sights.\n\nThere are a few things which I think should be different. Something I really think should be added for realism is being able to lock back the slides on pistols and charging handles on rifles. This would really help add to the realism and shouldnt be too hard to add. What should be easily added to lock back the slide on pistols is to have it so that when the slide is pulled back, the joystick can be pushed up to engage the slide lock. This would really add to the realism.\n\nAlso, there are times when multiple attachments will clearly fit on a rail, but this game doesnt let you attach it. Being able to do so would make it better, even when it wouldnt work or make sense, for realism. It would be cool to be able to line up a holo sight with a magnification scope like in real life.\n\nAlso, a suggestion(but not something I would say they necessarily MISSED), is to include gun events with multiple guns similar to a real life 3 gun competition.

I could not say it in any other way. But as all things do, it has a lot of problems or ways it could get better. For example, some of the grabbing mechanics and such are a bit wonky but not bad. This game could really use some multiplayer as well, doing this might also raise the playtime, players, higher ratings, and maybe allow it to get a head start before Pavlov: shack releases to the quest. Speaking of Pavlov it would allow it to be a competitor to Pavlov. It could also use more levels or different ways of doing a mission ( for example hostage rescue, planting a bomb, or going after a president.). This game would also profit from a campaign, using actual missions and cut-scenes to display story. I would also love to see humans, not just cut outs, as well as gore. These are just some ways this amazing game could get even better. Not saying this game is bad. This is your game and I believe if you use some of my ideas your game could get so much better!

I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic they all look and operate, and there are a LOT of them, with a huge assortment of useful attachments and upgrades to put on them. Essentially, this is a shooting gallery game, where what look like painted plywood targets of people or zombies pop up, move around, take hostages, and shoot back at you. There are different game modes depending on which class of gun (handguns, assault rifles, shotguns, etc.) you equip. I found the difficulty progression of each mode (except sniper rifle due to terrible scope implementation) to be very fair and challenging. Other than the awful scope implementation, I have no complaints about this game at all. I hope there is a Gun Club VR 2 sometime soon!\n\nI find that of all the VR games I've acquired, I can go back to this simple-yet-solid one over and over. As of March 2020, this game also supports crossbuy, so you buy it once and can play it on both your Quest and your PC (via Oculus Link or on a Rift). Awesome!!

Although, the bugs aren't particularly common, so there's not a significant need to worry about them.

There are tons of different scenarios for each category of weapon (pistol, SMG, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle), each of which you play through in order to earn money to buy better guns or attachments. It's a mix of fun, no-frills shooting, and good accuracy/target practice that you'll see in other shooting games. I had the most fun shooting through waves in the zombie mode.\nSome complaints I have stem mostly from the way the game handles the different \"contact points\" on each weapon. For example, I struggled a lot while using any rifle that had a charging handle near the barrel (such as the ACR or PSG-1), as every time I wanted to grab the grip, my VR hand would automatically snap to holding the charging handle instead. Some of the modes require quick reflexes, and you have to be able to reload pretty fast, so you can imagine how annoying this can be.\nAnother serious issue is that while upgrading weapons, a lot of the time you are told you \"can't use this attachment because you don't have any rails\", but my weapon CLEARLY has multiple open rails on it. For example, try attaching a rail onto the PSG-1, then try buying a bipod grip to put there. It will not let you, unless you buy the grip for another rifle, then spawn it, and manually attach it to the PSG-1.\nAside from those glaring issues, I still highly recommend this game for anyone with a Quest!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Jacob0123Apr 26 at 1:16 PM\nThe yee fun\n\nFub thevyub the yee\n\nHelpful | 0", "enigmaburrito21Mar 7 at 5:43 PM\nGreat game, needs more guns\n\nSo this game is fun, but it needs a lot more guns.

Add some basic LMGs too, like the PKM/RPK, M249 SAW, MG32 and MG34. Shotguns could be the M1014, AA-12, Supernova, KSG, SPAS-12 and SPAS-15, and the Citori 725. SMGs like the MP5SD, MP7, Beretta Cx4 Storm, Magpul FMG-9, Beretta M12, Colt 9mm, Skorpion. The USP could be an added pistol. Thats not a lot of guns, but its a start. Most of those are well known as well, so you could start adding in lesser known guns later. Theres also a bug where when I turn my head, my body doesnt turn with it and its really annoying.

You can add attachments to your gun/rifle, have unlimited bullets and so on. BUT it is a developer sandbox and you still have to learn and figure things out while at my age of 60 I am very frustrated. I am playing sitting down and I'm sure I clicked on sitting down mode but the counter is at my chest level and my gun keeps hitting the counter plus for some reason I keep holding my rifle from the top instead of cradling it underneath. I'm sure all this would be fixed if I stood up. I'm quite sure that the guns are very realistic and this is probably the best VR gun owner game in the market and if you want to learn, this game is it. As promise this game is worth 5 stars and probably more. However, since I'm 60, I'm play VR to get away from real life. VR is great for mindless shooters but this game is too serious. The whole reason for playing a VR game is to enjoy and even though it has a sandbox mode to try out the guns, the real game is still to grind through levels and you still have to learn how to use each of the guns.I love arcade shooters but this isnt it. The reloading sequence of having to grab the magazine, drop magazine, grab new one from belt, insert with careful alignment, grab top of gun and pull back ( you have to wait until you see that your hand did grab the top) plus you are under a timer totally destroys my enjoyment of a firing range. Having to go through earning money to buy the next gun plus the sequence of earning which range is available is painful. This game may be perhaps authentic but it creates artificial limitations that takes you out of the game more often then immerses you like having to earn money to buy the next gun.

Sure, you don't move around much in the game, but if you play any game for long, you drift a bit.\n\nThese are the most egregious problems with the game, but there are numerous other signs of poor programming or a desire to rush a half finished game to market. The shotguns often lose track of how many shells are in them. If you load and fire too fast they'll show as empty even if you just slid six shells into them. The 'you shot the wrong target' sound effect often comes up for no reason in the middle of the game'. A target you're supposed to hit occasionally shows up behind one you're not supposed to hit. The graphic that shows you the hit points of the target often obscures other targets, making certain challenges impossible on certain run throughs.\n\nAnd even where there aren't glitches, there are plenty of problems. There's not much to do in the game to begin with, the sniper rifle challenges are both boring and confusing, you find yourself fighting with the game to get it to see which part of the gun you're trying to grab sometimes...\n\nAll in all, it's a good proof of concept, but not a good game.

It makes u make quick decisions (don't shoot the hostages) and as u get more into it, the targets shoot back.\n\nIt's like an interactive gun range that continues to challenge you and make you challenge yourself. It's not just making sure your safety is off, ready to fire, but you have to reload (swap mags) while getting shot at. This is one game I can see me putting a couple hundred hours into. First time I played, my headset went down to 10% from full, if that says anything.

Im experienced with guns in real life and this game is mostly accurate. Theres only small things that are wrong, such as you can put a 556 drum mag into an AK, which you didnt know, an AK shoots a 7.62x39 not a 5.556x45.\nNormally, you can only put a 75 round drum into an AK, but this is a minor detail and it doesnt affect gameplay.\n\nOne thing I love is the weapon physics. If youre too close to a wall or surface, the barrel of your gun can get caught, which really gives a reason to pick lower powered SMGs, which are smaller, over other guns like sniper rifles and typical long guns.\n\nAnother thing that is great about this is the developer support. After people ask about an issue or adding a feature, the devs frequently do it, often in a short amount of time.\nOne thing thats somewhat weird about this game at least on the Quest version is that after about 15 minutes of playing, the graphics quality drops slightly. I dont know if thats my eyes playing tricks on me or my specific Quest being weird but if it is a common thing, it would be nice for it to be fixed.\n\nHeres some guns I would like to have in the game.\nDraco (AK pistol)\nMP7\nMasterkey Underslung Shotgun\nTec-9\nM16\nFive-Seven Pistol\nGalil\nMP5SD\n\nHelpful | 2", "doglover69Feb 19 at 5:31 PM\nGreat game but needs more areas\n\nLoved this game and finished both the warehouse and allied areas with each type of weapon.

The safety, which is really useless because the point of the game is to shoot guns, not the opposite. Sometimes when I'm in the middle of a zombie game mode and I'm reloading, I accidentally press on the thumbstick too hard and it turns on safety, which I'm unaware of until I reload and hear the click. I then try to press the button, which instead of turning off safety, releases the mag (which I do not intend to do obviously) but in the frantic trying to turn it off I don't notice, causing me to keep pressing it and wondering with growing frustration why it won't turn off, until I notice the mag. I put a new magazine in and guess what? Click. Only then does the safety SOMETIMES turn off, at which point I already have to restart because the zombies are upon me. Why does it have to be the thumbstick button? It's a useless feature that is in the worst place possible. I havent even found a way to change the controls, and this really makes me frustrated. It's able to be used with the other hand pressing x on the switch in the gun, so it why not just keep it like that? I understand the thumbstick also controls the fire mode, but why make it also control the safety? Frustration is not a fun emotion to have. If you even read this far, please at least take this into consideration. It would greatly improve my experience.

I think people who love the action pact first person games on Xbox/ PlayStation. Including call of duty and battlefield will really enjoy this game because it has many dope guns and modifications that you can use to make your load out the best it could possibly be. Its a great game with endless possibilities. But with great games usually comes with its downfalls. I believe they should add the rpg/ explosive weapons to the game. Also they should a running technique, to get to places like creed the game or boxing legends. What would also be great is instead of the simple metal people targets that shoot at you, they should use actual people who run around and shoot. It Would make the game more realistic.

I bought a shotgun with the in game currency, I grabbed handle with my right hand, it worked normal, but when I took my left hand and grabbed the part of the shotgun you pull back and forwards, my in-game hand teleports half a meter away from where my actual hand is, so you cant properly use any gun besides the pistols, but even then, your in-game hand is not where your actual hand is, its just close.\n\n\nThis flaw is major, but when you do use a pistol, boi its fun, so fun.

I gave it a chance (because if I did not like it I have the refund option), and it was surprisingly awesome.\n\nThe highly detailed dynamics of the weapons (reload, precision, customizing, etc) is fantastic, but it is also the kind of \"missions\", because it is not a simple shooting gallery. You will find \"enemies\", which although they are \"paper made\", they will shoot you (you have an energy score), and in some missions (like the zombie apocalypse) they will run/walk till you. The \"action\" modes are also great, because you will feel like an assault, covering roofs, stairs, etc and conquering zones.\n\nThe best part of the game, is that it has not aiming assistance, so it become absolutely fantastic to play shooting a \"head-shot\" style instead of wasting ammo (although it is infinite).\n\nFor me, nowadays, this is one of the top 5 games in Oculus quest.\n\nHelpful | 1", "umr_engnrJan 6 at 11:17 AM\nGreat for gun enthusiasts\n\nI was very impressed with the variety of weapons available and amazed at how much you can manipulate each one.

Start with a simple leaderboard, then add side by side target practice like normal, the add co-op. Maybe even make customisable spaces. Finally the cardboard targets they are just not very satisfying to shoot I understand you guys may have some policy but at least add an option to enable some kind of 3D moving character. You dont have to do it now as multiplayer must be the top priority.

There's a lot of levels and modes, but they all mostly recycle the same few enemy types in the same environments. It lacks the variety and creativity of something like the old Point Blank games. The \"Zombie\" and \"Sideshow\" modes come close, but both feel like they weren't given a lot of attention.\n\nOf course the real reason to grind through these levels is earning money to buy new guns. But from a gameplay perspective, they're all mostly the same thing. In fact, pistols tend to be better than larger guns, so the best strategy is just buying a cheap pistol and using that for every level.\n\nUnless you're a gun enthusiast and enjoy unlocking new guns for the look and sound, you'll quickly reach a point where neither new guns nor new levels are much motivation to keep playing, since in both cases they offer nothing new.

Each press of the interact button will load one shell ( A or X dependent on which hand ). For the revolver you will need to make sure you let gravity eject the empty shells by holding the gun up. To Streamline the process you can also get speedloaders in the upgrade store so they load like magazine fed weapons.

If you are a fan of gun play i would definitely recommend this. The action is fast paced and addictive, i could spend hours in the sandbox mode just reloading my gun its so satisfying. I do hope that more weapons get added in to this game such as a brake action shotgun of some type or an LMG. The two handed weapons can take some time to get used to but other then that the game is quite solid\n\nHowever the game is not perfect there are a few minor things that Hold this game back from a 5 star review. The gameplay modes can get very samey over time with only a few gimmicks to set them apart. The biggest problem Ive had with the game so far is the holstering. In most vr games Ive seen typically the torso of your character is invisible and for good reason. The torso in this game is large and obnoxious blocking your view of the things youve holstered and contorting around strangely every time you look down. There might be an option to disable it but if there is its not very apparent. It would be a lot easier if the torso itself was invisible so it be easier to see the little markers that show where you can place items. If there isnt already an option to make the torso invisible it should be added.\n\nOther then those two downsides the game is worth your time and i would commend you to try it out for yourself\n\nHelpful | 2", "chet4dDec 28 at 11:41 AM\nLots of fun\n\nIm no pro, but I really enjoy the progress in this game.

Using two handed weapons is extremely finicky to the point were it is tremendously better to just one hand the weapon\n2. There is no sandbox mode so if you want to relax and shoot you will have to sit on the lobby screwing around\n3. It takes way to much time and effort the get money in the game especially considering that it is not a multiplayer game so it will not effect anyone to bump up the amount of money received for missions\n4. Revolvers such as the rhino a unrealistic because the hammer never moves back or anywhere at all when you shoot also you cannot play Russian roulette.\n5. NO SANDBOX MODE!!!!!!!!\n6.

I dont have the time (or money) to go to the range as often as Id like. This is a much more satisfying simulation than I expected. I was pleasantly surprised with the detail when I accidentally engaged the de-cocker on the M9.\n\nThings I love:\n\n1. The sound. Every gun sounds a little different. That small detail really enhances the realism for me.\n\n2. The feel of the pistols. Im not entirely sure how the feel of the mechanics with different guns works, but it does.\n\n3. The gameplay options. There are only so many ways to keep range shooting interesting. Youve found them. The progression is logical and fun.\n\n4. The firearm details. Steps have been taken to appeal to gun owners and enthusiasts beyond what is usually expected in a game.\n\nI do have a few issues:\n\n1. The long guns dont feel right. Theyre difficult to control and use. Maybe its me, but I dont find them to be enjoyable.\n\n2. It would be nice to be able to try accessories before purchasing. Sights and scopes, especially, but also things like foregrips that impact interaction with the controller. In fact, a test range with non-moving targets to try out different weapons before purchasing would be really cool.\n\n3. Id love to see some cosmetic customization available. Finishes, grips, mag plates, etc.\n\n4. Haptic feedback is too weak. Since this is designed as more of a simulator, the haptic feedback should be as strong as possible for the best experience. Knowing this will chew up controller battery life, perhaps it would make sense as an optional thing.\n\nPlease keep the good stuff coming.

They can still kill you and the zombie mode has them moving. The guns work pretty decently. The ones I have issue with are the snipers as most of the rifles at least 2 of them are bolt actions so you have to reload (review wont let me use the c word) the gun per firing a round in the chamber. Though realistic it can be a bit.....frustrating honestly. Secondly, there are plenty of firearms from shotguns to assault rifles to SMGs to pistols and revolvers.\n\nIn the end there is a large bundle of content. Lots of replayability. Though the levels can feel repetitive so I suggest play on small amounts to prevent your boredom of this game because its honestly a fun arcade shooter.\n\nNow I would put this as a 5 star but I want the devs to see this. Your game crashes. A lot. On random times too. So when I start a round up, the level loads and then it just crashes. Doesnt happen too often but when it does it can kind of get a bit annoying.

Only problem is tracking! This is not really the Dev's fault its the limitations of the quest's tracking. Using a pistol absolutely fine but 2 handed weapons is what you would expect from inside out tracking. I just wish Oculus would have put 2 extra cams on the side of the headset! You end up having to hold 2 handed weapons is unrealistic poses just so you dont lose tracking. It really makes me worried for future ports like Onward & Pavlov. Maybe there is something the dev's can do (locking rear position once near head) but if not I think its the first time I've really come up against the limitations of the Hardware.\n\nSince this review the game has been altered (in which ways I dont know) but its a lot better thus an extra star. The handling of 2 handed weapons is much much better. The addition of the sandbox is a great idea. I love to show the quest to newbie's & try to get more people on board with VR, the ability to allow people to use any weapon means they dont have to play lots of levels to earn money to get to the good stuff!

The progression system adds a much needed element to a game that is much greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nI would love to see the developers continue to add quality of life changes as the game continues to evolve, little things like the way you grip magazines when you reload are things I would like to see changes made. Maybe like an alternate grip where you palm the bottom of the magazine instead of using the beer can grip. I'd also like to see if a one handed mode could be implemented, as it feels very comfortable to grip the dominant controller with both hands, but you can't easily reload this way.\n\nOverall a blast to play, good graphics and solid gameplay.

I go to the range 3+ times a week with all my guns to stay fresh, accurate, and to have fun. This is better in some ways because my range doesn't have moving targets that come after me!\nA few notes for the developers since their responses to reviews is what made up my mind to buy this game. Slamming the magazine in is a little cumbersome on a few gun and the graphics get a little glitch for some reason. Also, big one here for realism, the CZ-75's hammer doesn't stay clocked no matter how many times you slide the rack to chamber a bullet. It Does stay back in the M9 like it should. Also, having the safety engage randomly is frustrating. I understand realism for having it on the guns that do have one, but it shouldn't randomly engage and leave the player fumbling to turn it off while being rushed by zombies. Protip for new users, I suggest you start with the Glock 17 that doesn't have a safety until that annoying bug gets worked out. I'm also currently disabled and not able to move around that much, and while the demo of Super Hot was cool, it hurt me too much to do all the movements. This game requires some movement, but no bending down and ducking that I've found so far. Thanks for making the game guys, it's a lot of fun, reasonably priced, and only people like me and LEO will easily find the flaws in the realism because we handle the real guns quite often.\nFor less than a box of 9mm ammo at the range, you can have a permanent gun range with unlimited Free ammo set up anywhere you take your Quest VR headset.\nNew update - on a lot of different courses the Glock G17 simply disappears and doesn't spawn with me in the arena. Other guns work on those particular levels. Also, when trying to just replay a level without exiting, all of a sudden my gun is gone. Not holstered, not on the floor, just not spawned. When this happens there's no way to just quit the level either, I have to quit the game and restart, or let the cardboard cutouts kill me slowly. I won't knock off a star for these glaring issues yet as I'm hoping you get them patched soon!\n\nOK, now even the CZ75 won't spawn in matches half the time. I thought this issue was isolated to the Glock 17. Pretty sick and tired of having to quit and restart the game, so now I'm dropping the rating a star. Perhaps this was released a little too rushed as the more I play it, the more glitches and failures in coding I'm noticing. Totally takes you out of the experience. It's a shame I only got a few hours of enjoyment before being too fed up with it to continue playing even though I easily mastered it. It's probably harder for gun novices. Either way, I can't fully recommend this game anymore until the bugs are worked out. I hope the developers respond to this review with a patch for the game.\n\nHelpful | 4", "goalie_guyJan 1 at 5:14 PM\nGrate\n\nCool fun\n\nHelpful | 0", "DieselWolfyNov 3 at 5:29 AM\nBrilliant Experience!\n\nGunClub VR is definitely an amazing game.\nIt was the first thing I purchased upon setting up my Quest for the first time and I will say now with full honesty that I was not disappointed.\nThis game is fun and at times really engaging.\n\nNow, whilst I know the developers probably don't have any plans to add something like this in the near future, I would love to see possible multiplayer/Cooperation features, like maybe having a shooting contest with friends in a series of different ranges, or maybe something competitive similar to Pavlov.\n\nAside for that, this game is a must have gem for any Quest owners.\n\nHelpful | 0", "watt.liez.9Jan 29 at 3:56 AM\nPretty fun at the start\n\nGun Club VR is a pretty fun game when you first but after like 2 hours of playtime it gets boring really quick\n\nHelpful | 1", "Will_wrwr55Jan 3 at 4:04 PM\nOkish\n\nI would give a 5 star rating if they had an online mode or at least play against human bots and not cardboard.

For example, the bolt snipers always grab the wrong thing when I try to grab either the scope, bolt, or grip. Also, the shotguns. The racking sound is not in matching with the other gun sounds and the forend is all messed up and doesnt always rack right. Another thing, the gun supply while graphically pleasing and well selected, is lacking. I quickly got bored with the guns available. The customization options allowed me to keep playing but I still think more guns should be added. Finally, I wish that the screen didnt black out every time you spawned in an item.

I was looking for a simple target shooter like the old Point Blank game. Gun Club VR has a similar appeal but is infinitely better. I've spent hours on it already and see it lasting forever. So many guns and options available. I love that you can stay behind on a level or just generally shoot things up to practice aiming, reloading and charging. The sandbox is a nice addition specifically for this purpose and to see and use the different guns, ammo and accessories available, although I was confused by the hidden hand menu at first. I'm in the UK so I'm not an expert with guns, but I have shot some in the US. When I saw my favourite Sig Sauer P350, I had to have it. The model looks just like the real thing. It was locked at first, but you can play levels several times to boost cash reserves and it doesn't take long before you power up and can upgrade, not like some other games that make it too difficult to play and advance.\n\nA few thoughts for the devs:\n1. I'm left handed and as it defaults to right handed play, I thought I was going to have to claim a refund. Google said lefties could play, but the little 'cog' settings menu wasn't immediately obvious. I think this menu should be available from the beginning menu when setting the profile as well as in the range so you can configure all settings for your profile before you start.\n\n2. The settings menu has options that need some explanation. A context sensitive message would be useful when hovering.\n\n3. Teleporting doesn't always work in the campaigns. It works fine in the sandbox to point and rotate before jumping with either hand. I used my right hand mostly to teleport, but on some jumps it wouldn't register unless I used my left hand. EDIT: Sorry, my mistake. Teleporting in the campaigns isn't the same as the sandbox. Simply point the gun to the teleport and wait for the timer to register. Works perfectly.\n\n4.

I shoot in real life very often (law enforcement) and have one big gripe: the recoil in real shooting is extremely fast and the front sight comes right back down. In this game though, it is much slower and falsely makes the front sight slowly go up then down after each shot. The effect then, is that for quick shooting, your second shot will always be more inaccurate because of the canned recoil effect they use. If they want to fix it, either eliminate the recoil's vertical effect, or speed it up much faster.\n\nHelpful | 3", "lex57ukrOct 19 at 1:23 PM\nAwesome pistol experience\n\nThe pistol experience is awesome!

That said, the game quickly falls apart with the little mechanical movements in game. Magazine replacement, dropping a magazine and charging a weapon are difficult to perform and don't reflect real movement. Height adjustment and movement also need to be worked on in the game.

In sandbox, the teleportation is whenever i let go of the joystick, which i push forward naturally. of you (developers) could add a button or something to make the teleportation instead of just pushing the stick forward and letting go, it would be very nice\n\n4.) In sandbox, the wrist menu is a good idea, but it gets in the way. If you could add a button to pull up the menu instead of as soon as your wrist is facing up, would be very nice\n\n5.) Pistols do not have a second grip point.(cant shoot 2-handed)\n\n\nOverall, it is a very great game with great visuals. It is not perfect for realism though. The physics are nice as well.

We need speed loaders, one for the six shooters, and one for the seven shots. Hold the gun at a angle pop the cylinder open grab your speed loader, press the button load and your back in the fight.

Things you can move glow green, but the windows for that can be very tight. It's just frustrating to equip and modify attachments. I can't figure out how to flip down the sites on the MK18 (while glowing gray/blue?).\n2. I don't like the targets. Can you please use typical criminal / terrorist cardboard cutout models?\n3. The teleport to the next node gameplay mechanic is mostly annoying, probably because activating it is finicky too. Maybe just have it happen automatically after killing the last bad guy in a section.\n4. It's hard to reach spare mags when sitting on a couch or chairs with armrests. Please make the grenades and knife more handy to equip before the mission. The way you leave your vest should be persistent.\n5. Using long guns is pretty much a one handed affair. Perhaps using a (ProTube) gun stock would make this work, but I think there is lots of room to improve the virtual gunstock.\n6. The controller rumble is way too weak.

Slide should always lock back on an empty magazine. There are very few guns that this is not the case. Even if I rack it on an empty. 2. Empty mags disappear after 2, would be cool to see all the mags, even shell casings on the floor. 3. Trigger finger, booger hooks the trigger, should be pad of finger on trigger. 4. Would also be cool if prices were more accurate. The challenges could simply pay out less. If they were accurate, you could pay out per magazine like in real life. When you run out of 31s youd need to deal with your 17s, itd add an interesting dynamic. 5. Some cosmetic customization would be sweet too. Hydro dips, cerakote etc. 6. Recoil is not simulated, and Im not sure how this would ever be accomplished, however itd be cool if it could be. Overall a great game with even greater potential.

The guns are recreated very well and the shooting feels great. Just make sure to explore the settings and find out which controls are most comfortable for you. There are lots of events to spend time on and perfect your score. Modding the guns is pretty satisfying as well. The only thing I've come across which bothers me is the fact that you can't add more than one attachment per rail. For certain things it makes sense, but it seems like I should be able to attach both a foregrip and a laser to the under rail of an assault rifle, for example.

There is something very cathartic about mowing down zombies with an AK47 with a 100 round magazine and grenade launcher :). It would be great though if there were a couple more areas, and maybe an area where you could walk around. Would also like a never ending zombie option. Would be willing to pay more for these extras.

If this game is geared towards realism there's a few things that need to be changed. I have only played through the pistol scenarios so far and here is what I found. #1 when drawing from the hip, the pistol should already be charged. No operator carries without one in the chamber when on a mission. #2 when all rounds are spent the slide should stay back in preparation for another magazine to be inserted. In the game it not only it stays forward but when you insert another one it forces you to charge the weapon again. #3 I personally carry a glock 17 and it does not need a rail attachment to equip a laser or a sight. On the lower reciever it has groves that allow you to equip a flash light or a laser. The sights attach to the already existing holes of the iron sights. This is all I've found so far.\n\nHelpful | 1445\nDeveloper ResponseAug 22, 2019 at 6:11 PM\n\nHi p0pclutch - thanks for the amazing feedback. Always great to hear from people such as yourself. #1 So the way we have charging work now is that it will carry over its charge state from the lobby - so if you charged it there before entering out into the range you'll be good to go. If that is not working as intended for you, please do let us know. #2 This is indeed how they should be working so if you have found a gun in the game that does not do this, please let us know - we strive to match real-world behaviour wherever possible #3 Thank you for the oversight on the Glock 17 - we've released an update with the ability to attach things to the bottom of the G17. We are modelling up a specific sight that will connect on top of the glock that wont require a rail.

It provides a reasonable sense of realism, to the extent that I can actually work on some pistol shooting skills. No recoil or actual mechanical feel of course. You can't really use a proper grip for pistols because of the controller in your left hand unfortunately. I also find that the magazine animation for magazine reload is mostly wrong. No one inserts a magazine holding it from the bottom.\nFinally for game play, the long gun mechanics are really terrible. Difficult to control and on the Quest the front iron sight is difficult to see. Perhaps it's better on device with better screen resolution. Oh and left handed cycling of a bolt action (allied silenced rifle)? That's just dumb.\n\nI have found that the game crashes occasionally.

I could've seen the Devs being greedy, and charging for the main range, then charging for every other mode, and, I probably would've paid for them all, (reluctantly, and without a 5 star review devs, don't get any ideas lol). Action mode and Zombie mode took this from what would've been a cool shooting simulator and turned it into a great game. (And the night play with flashlights was icing on the cake).\n\nI was so tired of all the laser guns, and all the other crap I could've played on my VirtualBoy. This definitely stepped the Quest up a couple notches. I'll agree there should be a magazine release button, (ambidextrous), and a nice to have would be if it auto-switched your clip position, depending on which hand you start the round with, (for the select few of us that shoot rifles left-handed and pistols right), but, neither of these things are near worth a star removal.

The rumble is so weak I had to try all my other shooting games to make sure it wasn't the controller themselves. As they are generally noticeably weaker in rumble than PSVR Move controllers. But my other games registered enough rumble to feel immersive. I took another star away because this should've been noticed in testing. Simulating gun kickback in the rumble and differentiating it between weapons are key in a game like this. Maybe the touch controller only has one kind of rumble motor so it has a limited range of feedback. If so, then that's not on the developer's.

When I first started I thought I was going to get bored but new game modes started unlocking to add hours of gameplay. Overall everything works smooth. Reloading was an issue for me initially but I quickly found out thats just because I was panicking.\n\nIt would be nice to have a 360 mode or mode that can utilize the walking play space of the quest though.\n\nQuick tip to start - buy the AK47 after the starter pistol. Skip the initial upgrades, save up to max the cartridge, and then max the damage. Play through the zombie stages and now money flows easy. Add 4 grenade launcher attachments to the AK47 and now you have a 100 bullet, 4 grenade, max damage zombie mowing machine to farm cash to unlock all other guns!\n\nEdit: I found out with the right layer of attachments I can get 10 functional grenade launchers on the AK.

There are a variety of game modes to explore, with each gun type having its own set of challenges. It rewards you with cash, which you can use to buy and upgrade guns. And there are PLENTY of guns to choose from. While the variety of upgrades and guns are more than satisfactory, I do wish there were more differences in their handling as many guns in each gun type (pistols, SMGs, ARs) act out pretty much the same. The upgrades and stats of the guns can also be further explained in detail, or possibly implementing a test or trial mode to decide if the gun feels right for you before paying the hefty sum. There is also times where sometimes holding bigger guns such as ARs and even SRs in handgun form fairs better, as scoping down and snapping to each target feels much too slow and clunky.\n\nNone of these SMALL cons take away from the immersion of shooting, however, as each shot feels extremely satisfying. I do wish the magazine release control could be mapped to a button rather than pulling down on the joystick, but that is just a personal ergonomic/quality of life issue.\n\nAll in all, definitely a MUST BUY!\n\nHelpful | 4", "vrabbitsAug 10, 2019 at 5:55 PM\nCASTING\n\nSo I'm knocking 1 star off because it doesnt support casting which really really sucks.

The game is entertaining, it offers a TON of levels - this is the longest game on Quest, without being boring. Even now I cannot wait to finish this review to go back and play another level. I'm almost done with the pistol, owning the Platinum Desert Eagle. It's superb ! The night levels, with the laser and the lantern are creating a special feeling. It's great !\n\nYou're getting rewarded for trying and you know you get even more rewards if you try harder. The rewards system is fantastic. The game is allowing you to buy the best stuff if you work a bit. You don't have to play like a maniac\n\nThe golden and platinum weapons are fantastic in any way. The fact that you can upgrade your weapons is also great. I love the fact that you can actually use the table to install the upgrades. Super fun thing !!!\n\nThe precision of the guns is very good. The reloading system is bad, because to reload you need to move the left controller outside the tracking area (specially on higher zombie levels) and from time to time you come back empty handed :))\nThe only thing that is actually badly designed is the grenade launcher. Aiming it is almost impossible and it's useful only on large zombie packs around you. Reloading it takes too long on zombie levels, so you're limited to one shot / level. Good luck with that :))\n\nFor the rest, ignoring the inherited hardware tracking problems of the Quest, the game is absolutely fantastic and, if possible, I would rate it the best game here in the Quest store so far.\n\n10 out of 10 stars for this title.

The shotgun rack sound if noticed is very low quality, which also takes a long time to reload compared to how fast targets come up. Some of the older guns have invisible rails and make stuff float on top of face the wrong way.

You have ww2 nazi targets that shoot at you and even a cool zombies mode where hordes of zombie targets come after you. As you progress In the game, the challenges become harder and the game really tests how fast you can reload. The only thing I wish the game could improve on for now is adding a feature that explains what is needed in order to use a certain attachment. There is many attachments In the game and certain rails or mounts are required for certain gun attachments. Ive bought certain flashlights or scopes thinking it would work on my weapon only to find out it doesnt and I need another type of attachment, so hopefully the game can improve on being more specific.

I love the variety, customization, and that you get to manually attach upgrades. There's a few frustrating issues on the Quest (still 5-stars though, I'd give it 6 if I could): Some guns are incredible hard to reload or charge. The TMP is hard to get the magazine in quickly, the FAMAS is ridiculously hard to charge, the drum shotgun has a safety right next to where you reload and it's the same button to load it as it is to change the safety. As others have mentioned, the sway when your second hand grabs a long gun is a bit annoying, but I don't know how they'd fix that. The distance of the target behind hostages is a little too close and random, sometimes there is no way to hit them. One time I had 2 hostages pop up in the exact same spot and you could only see like a finger from the target. Some trials/experiences don't seem to be tailored to the type of gun you're using. For example, pump shotgun should have its own configurations for sideshows and such because the same ones I use for pistols and rifles are impossible with a pump shotgun. One last suggestion, maybe I just haven't noticed it, but in real life you can release a semi-automatic pistol's slide stop with your thumb and don't necessarily need to pull it back after reloading.\n\nHelpful | 1", "mercilessqtipJul 18, 2019 at 9:57 PM\nQuest-alicious\n\nThis is really an awesome experience.

Thanks!\nUpdate: forgot to add this last bit, but for 2 handed weapons can you make it easier to aim? Pavlov VR has this perfected by making your hand stay closer to the gun rather than further when 2 handing. This makes it really easy to do small adjustments with a sniper rifle at long range. Sniping in this game is EXTREMELY hard, and I think something like this would help. Maybe add it as an option in the menu?\nUpdate 2: seen the reviews you responded to and it seems like you have already seen everything I just said.

So I have a ton of gun games and experience of when it's right and when it's wrong. Firstly the right, INCREDIBLE work on the graphics and optimisation devs! From a mobile processor you've done wonders. The feel of the PC varient is very much there so congrats are in order. However, the biggest issue for me (and I suspect you) is the fact the new quest and rift S controllers have a tracking ring on top.. Why is this a pain for gun games? Well mainly for reloading the pistols where you need to cokk the pistol by sliding the top of the gun back right across where the real-world controller tracking ring is. What the devs have done is actually a pretty simple solution, the second your hand is holding a gun the in-game position of the gun is raised about 2 inches from where you're actual hand position is, so when you cokk (spellling change - thanks oculus) the pistol you go to grab just above where the real-world tracking ring is. This works really well and doesn't feel unnatural, brilliant solution!\n\nThe problem however is when this is applied to two handed weapons which makes aiming and looking down the sight feel off and unnatural. Where most two handed weapon reloads don't suffer the problem a pistol does with where you cokk the gun (usually the side) having the raised gun position on the dominant hand is not needed at all, and just feels weird. I hope they add an option to remove it for two handed weapons soon, it really break immersion for me.\n\nThe second gripe is also an easy fix.. Please change cokking the two handed weapons and pistols to a trigger action and not a grip one! This way, when holding a two handed weapon where cokking the gun is near where you would grip with the front hand, you don't accidentally grab a lever when you just want to hold the gun with the front hand!\n\nAnyway, great start, I look forward to updates and really hope you fix these small but immersion-breaking issues.\n:)\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseJul 19, 2019 at 3:29 PM\n\nHi cloudkake - thanks for the terrific feedback. We can certainly add an option to disable the offset you referenced on the two-handed weapons. As for charging a two-handed weapon, adding an option to use trigger or grab (or perhaps even user assignable) is also a good idea. Some of us here have been caught by that exact issue, too. We're always looking to improve the experience so we appreciate your feedback. Look out for these tweaks in an upcoming patch :) Thanks again!", "SturanBJul 19, 2019 at 4:18 AM\nAlmost excellent\n\nReally great and fun shooting gallery and simulation.

I can see this quickly becoming one of my most played games and it has a lot of replay value. Its great as a drop in / show to friends game that is easy to pick up, something I wish there was more of on the quest.\n\nMy only few minor complaints and suggestions for dev. Its crying out for a party play mode, its most fun when youve got friends round and wanting to set high scores for each other to beat. I want to be able to do that without exiting to main menu to self a different profile. A party mode, where highest score set gets to enter his/her name on a score table , where its quick to replay a round whilst passing the headset around. Best sabers party mode is a great example.\n\nThe other is a few bugs Ive noticed. The torso physics and movements feel really off, trying to look down at your belt for example is impossible as the torso moves\nAlso to block your view . The option to switch off torso does not do anything. Similar other options such as hand offset did not appear to do anything.\n\nIn my first 20 mins of the game it was really confusing and unclear what rail / site etc did what and what was required in order to fit a part I had purchased, this led to me spending money on several items , non of which where the right combinations.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Stark_IndustriesJul 22, 2019 at 1:32 PM\nGREAT GAME !!!\n\nThe Quest is just unbelievable Gun Club VR is a fantastic game this is where is is at PC Connected VR R.I.P the Quest and stand alone VR will kill the VR PC welcome to the future.

And regarding the handling of the long guns, I've seen multiple reviews saying that the two-handed weapons weren't done right. I respectfully disagree.\n\nThe developers were limited by today's tech. There's no rifle accessory for these controllers, so what should they have done? They should have done exactly what they did - give you the option to shoot with two hands or one hand. You can shoot the rifles and SMG's with one hand, which in most cases is the most efficient way to so it. It may feel a little more lame shooting them one handed like you're Master Chief, but here's the thing - if you become fluent in the mechanics of the game (just like you would aim to do with any game ever made) you can operate them efficiently with two hands. It actually feels very controlled when you're shooting a SMG or assault rifle from the hip with both hands. It feels great.\n\nGive me the option to do whatever, and I'm happy with it.\n\nReasons it's only four stars - music needs to be turned off, menu options could be a little better. All the little things make it feel like a low budget production, which... well it was, so that makes sense.\n\nStill a great game, highly recommend it.

For more than an hour I thought the controls were wonky on the MK18 Assault rifle because I kept toggling the iron sights on and off while trying to reload. As it turns out you dont use your fingers, just the middle finger button. Every new gun purchase should instruct you on how to use it. Otherwise something like this creates a distraction from the fun and the game feels broken. In addition, the animation shows 2 fingers reloading even though Im just using my middle finger. Not very realistic. I also dont see the need to flip the iron sights up mid gun fight.

The game is currently set to offset your virtual hand upwards by a small amount ( when grabbing things ). This is to mitigate clacking the controllers together when trying to operate the weapon. There is room for improvement here though, we will look at adding a slider to adjust this to preference. Without the offset, after playing and getting familiar with the controls, it is possible to learn how to orientate the controllers without them clacking.

However, the realism is lost for me due to two features that are missing: Breathing doesnt affect the precision of shots (or maybe it does, but not enough to be noticeable), and sight acquisition for pistols is difficult because two separate controllers must be held. If there was an option to allow reloading to be done with one controller, I wouldnt have to drop my handgun grip, fumble around for the other controller, load a magazine, and then assume the handgun grip.\n\nWhile not the most fun of things, a simple lane with targets would be amazing for realism. Then people could try various shooting positions, try to tighten up their groupings, or try 150s, 250s, 300s like a VR qual.\n\nRifles are rough to hold, and the option of holding the hand guard on some rifles is non-existent.

So far I found these problems:\n- Weapons not accurate to reality, as stated by other reviews, many weapons doesn't behave as the real counterparts, pistols not keeping the slide open when empty, M4 fire selector all wrong, rail size and possition messed up, ak style side attachment not usable...\n- All rail attachments are not up to scale, they're about 75% and you can't choose facing for them making most raisers and side rails look pretty weird.\n- Hand positioning breaks the real hand to virtual hand position constantly. Why my virtual hands moves off my real hand when I grab something?\n- What happens with the silly new targets? WWII targets are ok, but warehouse targets are really off-theme, what happened to old terrorist targets? You SHOULD really add the option to select the target sets you want to use. New ones are ridiculous.\n- Features for previous games are missing, no challenges, no special characters to duel, no gun skins...\n- You reused scenarios from previous games, but this really needs new sets. The office from Swat Accademy is probably the best one you made up to date.\n- Bugs from previous games are still there :(\n- Aiming long weapons with no protube (or similar) is impossible, a feature like virtual Stock from Pavlov VR is a must have. About this point, take any long gun, try to aim grabbig both hands and then aim grabbing only with one hand... you'll notice control is way better if you actually dont grab the weapon with your secondary hand!!! Stock on shoulder should be more important that leading hand.\n\nI thought that GunClub VR for Quest will have a lot more content as it came late to Oculus Quest party, but it seems more like a fast port, maybe too much for a 20 game.\nI like the game, but there is still a lot to correct and work on.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21, 2019 at 4:24 PM\n\nHi TopoSolitario - we appreciate you taking the time to provide your feedback and thanks very much for joining us along the way with previous versions of Gun Club! Always great to hear from long-term users. So a couple of things we'd like to address here. Weapon accuracy is something we're always working on improving, so if you find something that doesn't look right, please reach out and let us know. In regard to the hand offset you're describing, that is something we implemented to prevent potential controller 'clacking' - with the Quest and S's new inverted tracking rings, many weapon interactions caused these rings to collide really breaking the immersion. The offset mostly avoids this. Having said that, we've found that weapons can be interacted with without the offset once users are aware of the 'clacking' potential so we will be allowing users to reduce or remove this offset in a future update. Also, two handed improvements are always on the list and we will be looking into new options there also. As for features, the Quest version actually has the most content out of any version of GCVR out there right now, minus the Sandbox which is coming soon. We're committed to making Gun Club VR the best weapon simulator possible be so please don't hesitate to reach out to us with any issues that you might find: https://thebinarymill.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new - thanks again for the feedback!", "TrevorkianJul 20, 2019 at 1:33 AM\nGames flawed as of now\n\nOkay wtf you seriously expect me to hold the grib button down the whole time i have the gun in my hand smh thats the reason i dont play robo recall seriously its not that way on the vive why would you make it that way...... seriously though im supposed to have a death grib on the controller so i dont accidently drop the gun for hours\n\nThis is an awesome game not the most amazing but tons of fun with lots of weapons and things to do i bought it for the vive and i felt it was worth buying again for the quest its probably the second best game next to sairento on the quest\n\nHelpful | 9\nDeveloper ResponseJul 20, 2019 at 1:45 AM\n\nHi Trevorkian - we'll add a toggle for this in an upcoming update.", "davidbrannon62Jul 21, 2019 at 6:42 PM\nWow\n\nLove it\n\nHelpful | 0", "randomnoob1837Jul 22, 2019 at 1:14 AM\nit's fun\n\njust wish there was an option to have a free range and use all the guns but it's still fun\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 22, 2019 at 1:26 AM\n\nHi randomnoob1837 - the sandbox mode with exactly this is coming in an update soon :)", "NightMonk3yJul 25, 2019 at 3:13 AM\nExpensive\n\nToo expensive just for shooting gallery game, you dont even have the freedom to run around and shoot.\n\nHelpful | 4", "ljhr85Jul 22, 2019 at 7:49 PM\nGame wiped over 3 hours worth of progres\n\nThis game is so buggy it's unbelievable it got released.\n\nNot sure if this is a big or just terrible design choice but when I loaded my game back up today, my fully purchased maximum ammo clip was not there in my upgrades section, but the money I spent to pay for it has gone.\n\nThis is pathetic and makes me not want to ever play the game again\n\nI will be asking for a refund if this rubbish continues\n\n\n\nWhat an absolute disgrace of a game that is not a new game at all.

U dont even need a good computer to do it.Pavlov is free and still in development, and I still prefer it over Gun club.\n\nHelpful | 0", "mark.burton22Jul 22, 2019 at 3:02 PM\n\nExcellent game can we get an SA 80 AND an SLR added to armoury \n\nHelpful | 0", "elooijengaAug 19, 2019 at 3:46 AM\nVery addictive\n\nNice game, you can easily play it for hours and hours.

It can be reloaded like the other shell fed shotuns. Grab shells from your ammo bag and bring them near the rear of the shell tubes ( near the trigger group ) Press the interact button ( A or X ) to load individual shells into the tubes. When a tube is full pressing interact again will rotate to another tube to fill that one. You can also rotate the tubes manually by hovering your hand over the front of the tubes ( foregrip area ) and pressing interact. Based on feedback we are going to be looking into merging this approach with a more intuitive method by manually inserting the shell into the tube ( while still being able to speed up the process by pressing interact ) Hope this helps", "turtlehead69Jul 18, 2019 at 2:14 PM\nOh dear\n\nThis was great on the Go. Now you can spend all your time trying to reload. Fun has gone.\n\nHelpful | 9\nDeveloper ResponseJul 18, 2019 at 4:47 PM\n\nHey turtlehead69 - try fitting a bigger clip to minimize reloading otherwise the free-play sandbox mode which we'll be adding in an upcoming update will allow for unlimited fire without the need for reloading, if you so desire.", "paradanJul 21, 2019 at 2:16 PM\nGun stops working during a challenge\n\nFor some dumb my gun stopped firing for no reason and when I tried to fire it in a challenge it didn't fire it because of safety on the gun why would you do that\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21, 2019 at 11:41 PM\n\nHi paradan - it sounds like you might have accidentally flicked on the safety for your weapon which will stop it from firing. To toggle the safety, press right on the analog stick on gun hand, or if hovering with the other hand it's the interact on the off-hand (X for righties, A for lefties). Hope that helps!"]
