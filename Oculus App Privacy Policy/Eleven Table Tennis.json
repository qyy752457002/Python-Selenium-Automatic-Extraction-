Where I found 11 has a huge selection for beginner practice playing the practice opponent has a nice variety of practice strokes that one can respond to plus the option to practice your serve try different shots, it was to me much more versatile for a beginner medium player over racket Fury.

This well executed physics table tennis game is no exception. You can play matches with a bot with different difficulty levels, play against others, and my favorite is just hitting the ball back and forth with a bot practicing hitting.\n\nIt's so much fun and so worth it.

But after 12 hours of neglecting my family to immerse myself in the game, I can say for sure that this is WELL WORTH my 22$. Its very sensitive to spins but not overdone. The levels of AI opponents make it easy to learn and challenging as my skill level increases. I like how the ball control gets even more precise when switched from the amateur paddle to the expert and that there is Zero waiting to put a new ball in play while in free play mode. I also really liked that youre not required to play online until you are ready, the AI opponent is always ready and willing to just swat back and forth with me.

I didn't think I would be buying a table tennis game. But I've always loved it, and thought virtual reality would be a good place to get it so you don't have to keep picking up the balls.\n\nI was immediately impressed with how real it felt to play. As far as feeling like you're actually doing something, it's probably one of the most realistic things I've done in VR. The ball reacted exactly like it would in real life, and even just hitting it feels real. Maybe because the paddle and the Quest controller are similar weight.\n\nThe bonus is that you can chat with people while you play, and I have had some really great conversations.\n\nThere's a little lag sometimes, but depends who you're playing against, and where they are. I know there are additional settings to mess with but I have not touched those.\n\nWouldn't hurt to add a few more settings to play in.\n\nDEVELOPERS: Can you PLEASE make a game as good as this, with tennis?

Quest has a bowling and golf putt game. While both are extremely representative of the true models, they can't find a way to give you the weight of the sport. No disrespect to the devs as that is impossible unless you have some type of weight system for gaming.

And I like it more than real ping pong in many ways because there is no ball chasing and I can instantly summon a new ball, and practice moves over and over again without tiring my AI opponent. And when I'm ready to play with someone live (virtually), I can do so at any time. (Though I'm still figuring out how to invite someone else to play. I can only seem to accept requests from others.)\n\nThe physics are amazing. And the community is helpful. Someone I met through Eleven already taught me how to spin the ball on serves and I'm learning from other skilled players. So fun.\n\nMy only requests would be more rooms / locations to play in.

My biggest annoyance is the table position which constantly gets stuck at a funny angle and doesn't respond to resetting the playing view by holding the oculus button. It's so frustrating because sometimes you can be on top of the table or at the side of it and have have to physically move around the room to get in position. This is a real struggle when there are walls and furniture in the way. The second issue is with the player levels, mine and my opponents level seems to change with every point scored. Again, annoying when you're trying to find players if a similar skill to play against. The third thing is when you start a game, you can see your opponent waiting but they can't see you and you need to leave the table. Lastly, tracking struggles from time to time and the game will freeze up.\n\nThat seems like a a lot of bugs for the game to still be great, but it really is a great game and I've spent hours playing it. Just sort the bugs out and this will be a 5* game.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response4 days ago\n\nhi chrishulse1. Thanks for the review. I'll also send this via oculus chat so we can have a nice back and forth. The table reset has been decoupled from the system button a while ago now. The tutorial has been retriggered with bright red and green letters saying not to use the system button :). It was on the last page that you can't skip. So i guess you just pressed the ok/skip button at the bottom without noticing the bright red and green large bold text :). I'm not sure what you mean about player levels. Skill level? Height from the ground? The issue where one person sees the second, but not vice versa is certainly a bug we are working on. How often does this happen to you? We are working on improving how the tracking is used for the game, but at the end of the day, unfortunately, we are limited by the hardware. The game freezing up is a known issue - but so far, not even oculus knows why it's happening. (the error doesn't happen within the game logs...it happens deep within oculus system logs). --- ah I can't send you a chat message via oculus because of your settings.

Sometimes there are little glitches where I am pretty certain I hit the ball but it registers as a miss, or the velocity I hit the ball doesnt quite seem to translate to the shot, but on the plus side, you can put spins on the ball and they react the way I expect them to, not being a pro or even particularly any good at ping pong. My biggest beef is when it comes to trying to adjust the position of the table in game so it matches up better with my guardian. It just seems impossible. Once I went back through the tutorial just to set the table up better, and it crashed the game and I had to reboot the whole headset. Anyway, I can tell you that l you that I really enjoyed this game from the minute I stepped into the virtual room and grabbed my paddle. There are several game modes to enjoy, including just returning serves to a robotic ball server, or you can play against your own Oculus avatar, which is fun, and there's multiplayer and beer pong and more.

Physics engine is way better and pretty tunable. The game is playable at least after some fine tuning. For beginners, this is a very good simulation fof the real thing, and might bring even more fun thanks to online matches with a pool of players of various skill levels. And it seems that the developer really cares about user feedback and keeps improving the game, this is a big plus. Bravo!\n\nNow the issues (why only 4 stars):\n\n1. I found it very easy to completely miss the hit (occasionally hit the edge of the paddle) when doing a fast swing like forehand fast top spin loop, even after I adjust the paddle grip to match my actual paddle grip (took me more than half an hour of fine tuning). Even smashing misses a lot so it's unlikely an issue with the angle of paddle setting. Slower loops and hits are a lot less likely to miss. I'm talking about playing with robot, so it's not internet latency issue. I guess it could be somewhat related to Quest's low 72Hz refresh rate (if the sensors sample with similar rate), but I think it could be compensated with algorithm in the physics engine, maybe something like better trajectory interpolation. This one is a deal breaker as I cannot play a serious game with only toy shots, and whenever I attack I miss the ball.\n\n2. I couldn't do any of my regular serves. I customized the bounciness and spin and tried a lot of combinations, including max on both, but still couldn't serve over the net for a few of my serves. I use a good paddle (Butterfly innerforce layer alc, tenergy 05 & 80), and feels the paddle physics in the game just couldn't resemble the real paddle especially when serving long back spin or fast side spin, both would end up in the net with very low speed most of the time. I guess the physics engine here would need a large hand swing to create high speed, and wouldn't (or is not able to) honor a fast small swing and rotation which is very common when serving. Might also have something to do with the low refresh/sensor sampling rate, not sure. Almost a deal breaker.\n\n3. A small bug: the game was fairly easy crashing after being adjusting the paddle grip for a few minutes. Nothing serious, just a bit annoying.\n\nI gave it 4 stars for the great effort especially the physics engine, but that doesn't mean it works for me as a training tool or even a fun game to play. Without fixing or improving the 1 and 2 above, I would not spend much time playing it, since otherwise it might mess up my skills and feel in real table tennis.\n\nHope to see these issues addressed soon! Will update my review if that happens.\n\nHelpful | 31\nDeveloper ResponseMay 20 at 10:56 AM\n\nhi deepthinker. Thanks for the long review. We are aware of the tracking limitations and will be trying to fix that. The problem is less i the physics engine, and more that, so far, the oculus platform itself is misrepresenting the position of the controller on fast swings. I am in contact with them, and there are a few thing we can try. Regarding paddle physics - that is for an area that needs improvements. We did just push an update that might help with the crashing - and also introduce a big update to the ball machine. me:carrotstien discord: https://tiny.cc/vr11 email: devs@forfunlabs.com", "bax209723 days ago\nLike playing real sport\n\nI have had this game for over 1 year, and I still love it.\n\nGreat exercise as well.

Which VR game is better? My impressions:\nGameplay: Eleven wins here. Racket Fury is arcade-like, organized into levels and opponents, and you unlock your way through the game. The early levels in Racket Fury are easy to beat because the robot opponents are programmed to make random dumb mistakes. You can play defensively and as long as you don't miss the table or fail to hit the ball you will win eventually against these 'rusty' robots.\nEleven is a simulation, and it means business. There are no points to score, no equipment to buy, and no need to progress through levels, the world is your oyster. If you wait for the AI to make a dumb mistake you're in for a very long game... even if the AI is with the difficulty set to 0. I like this because it challenges the beginner to think about offense from the start. You can't slide by on defense alone. Plus Eleven offers a few useful practice modes, like quadrants where you've got to control the ball. After just two days with Eleven, I saw a dramatic improvement in my real-life table tennis skills.\nEleven has lots of substance, but Racket Fury has style. Racket fury doesn't feel cobbled together. Its sci-fi aesthetic has coherent themes and all its assets are custom made. The opponents are brought to life through motion capture data,\nand they seem less like robots than the AI opponents in 11, even though the opponents in RF look like robots. 11 has more bugs than RF too. I think I encountered some bugs in multiplayer, which infuriated my opponent.\nDespite these flaws, Eleven offers real substance. If I had to pick one to play I would choose Eleven without hesitation.\n\nHelpful | 276", "Radlund24 days ago\nRealistic and fun!\n\nGreat game over all, lots of fun gamemodes as well as multiplayer, however ping can be an issue (but its displayed before every game so you can chose not to play vs high ping)! only issue is that sometimes it looses track of the room and requires a restart.\n\nHelpful | 0", "S_H_BJul 9 at 11:24 AM\nRemarkably realistic\n\nI used to play table tennis quite a bit and this game has rekindled my love of the game.\n\nUnlike the other TT game on Quest, which I didn't find very realistic, in particular regarding the power of each shot, this is bang on the money.\n\nTop work devs!\n\nHelpful | 0", "LordMelkorJun 29 at 12:29 PM\nAmazing Kinematics\n\nThis literally feels like playing real ping pong.

If you enjoy the physics in Racket Fury, there is nothing Eleven can ever really do for you. The physics are completely different to the extent that people generally are not able to switch between the two without huge adjustment periods. (maybe you can) Any inconsistencies that you have observed are due to tracking issues. When tracked, the results will be the same every time. RF has a lot of assists in that department, even in simulation mode - but that is just a choice that dev made, and there are definitely users more happy with something that makes them feel like they are playing table tennis, even if they aren't quite doing so. We are working with oculus to improve the tracking and we may be able to completely remove tracking irregularities soon - but until then, the hardware limitation, mixed with the no-assist simulation game play, will result in the experience you have (when your tracking environment is sub par for whatever reason) Stop by the discord, i'll be happy to discuss in more detail me:carrotstien discord: https://tiny.cc/vr11", "elhijodefe19 days ago\nPretty realistic but difficult\n\nMaybe I just need to keep practicing so that my muscle memory can take over but it has been difficult to get a feel for this game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "FcukSakeTomApr 29 at 12:33 AM\nBoom\n\nI never leave reviews for anything - However this is saving me In lockdown.

It feels like playing actual table tennis!\n\nIn the brief time Ive been playing, though, Ive encountered some glitches that I hope will be fixed in a future release:\n\n The game has frozen on me twice, to the point that I had to reboot my Oculus.\n\n It doesnt retain all user preferences. I select Mountain Chateau as my setting, but it reverts back to default after I quit the game. The strict serve rules function has toggled on me; it was active when I first setup the game, then wasnt the next time I played, then it didnt accept my preference after I chose it. My selection of AI settings dont take affect immediately and the AI has become unresponsive.\n\n Gameplay doesnt pause when you press the menu button.\n\n My username doesnt display consistently. Its been visible a couple times, but the box is typically blank when I view it.\n\nIn addition to correcting these issues, there is some refinement that would be appreciated:\n expanded music selection\n additional play environments\n a selection of AI appearance options\n some recorded vocal AI responses\n rewards for accomplishments\n\nThe game is fun and Ill continue to play it, just looking forward to an update.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 14 at 10:03 AM\n\nhi Brick0228.

Physics in this game is to the point. Just few suggestions for developers\n- Add a backhand-only, forehand-only, top spin etc options during practice\n- Many people don't have enough play space available & it make it unsafe to return wide shots. You can use guardian boundary data & restrict ball hitting in human v/s computer matches/practice. Or reduce room size based on guardian boundary.\n- In multiplayer game I seen one issue in higher latency scenario. Say if I hit a smash & other person returns it successfully, I see other person standing still & suddenly see ball returned out of nowhere. It feels odd & breaks immersion.\nNow you can't get away with latency, but you can show person reaching to hit a ball even before you get actual data from other player. Once you get data you can correct position. It would keep the current player on alert & it would feel more natural despite higher latency.\n\nHelpful | 5", "knicksfeenJul 5 at 12:54 PM\nSuper realistic\n\nThis game is so real.

The paddle is similar in weight to the controller, and that little haptic feedback when the ball hits makes it so real. But most important, the physics pull you into the game. When you get to a high level, the things youre able to do are essentially 1-to-1 with real life. If youre trying to decide between Eleven and Racket Fury, I would always recommend Eleven.

What does this all mean or how is this relevant I hear you cry, well when I bought Eleven and tried to play I couldnt keep the ball on the table, it would fly off just like above and it brought back fond memories, I then started the gentle tab approach and yes it works the same as that day in the pub.

Because we are a very small team, and because we are trying to work as fast as we can, we can't spend enough time communicating through the game every single change. If you join the discord, whose link can be found in the left panel of the default menu, you'll see a notification channel that describes exactly what changes in each version. Because oculus platform is messing up the position of the tracking space, we have decoupled the position of the table from the tracking space. Instead, it is coupled to the gaurdian. This mean, that you should only need to set it once, and then as long as you don't update your guardian, it will stay exactly where you left it. Part of this, is to remove the ability for oculus to recenter or reset anything from their side. This means, holding down the oculus button does nothing. Instead, as the game tutorial suggests, use the B/Y buttons (press and hold) to achieve the expected result.

Example: I couldn't use my tomahawk serve well in beta, but that seems fixed...as well as other serves. So nicely done there.\n\nI didn't necessarily get this for multiplayer, but the lobby looks busy and I got a lot of requests to play. Multiplayer play may need some improvement though. I thought I could read my opponents' moves but what looked like a huge miss-hit turned into a smash-like return on my side. I also am pretty sure the game didn't register some points I should've got for a double bounce on the opponent's side of the table. In other words, they were still able to hit a dead ball.\n\nIt takes some getting used to because it is VR and not real world, but if I shank the ball, I am sure it is my fault and not the game's. In other words, as a simulation, this seems on par with real physics. The ball machine will be my training tool since I am in an apartment and need to practice my strokes while in quarantine.\n\nIn summary, this game is a lot of fun for those not needing an arcade unrealistic experience. If you want to play for real, this game supersedes any other table tennis game I've played. I hope the developers continue to improve multiplayer experience and add content for solo playing.

The physics are excellent, the game is straightforward (it is table tennis after all), and the multiplayer is a ton of fun.\n\nSome downsides: if you move too fast and you're not facing your paddle, sometimes the tracking is poor and won't register a hit; the multiplayer lobby and functionality is a little janky, especially trying to add friends.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game, you'll get hours of time out of it - you'll have a lot more fun if you have a good amount of space available though!

Well quite simply, this game belongs up there with them. Yes there are more forgiving table tennis games out there which are excellent from an arcade perspective, but this takes it up a notch.

Anyway, playing a lot of Racket fury and getting very good at it, I thought I was making progress in my real life game with racket fury, so I went to play in real life and it actually had made me much worse!\n\nThen I heard of the beta of Eleven Table Tennis on Quest and gave it a shot. What a difference! The physics felt so realistic!! My real life serves worked directly in Eleven when I struggled to do them in Racket Fury...\nSo this time again I thought I was making progress in my real life game... So I did the real life test again and everything I learned translated, new serves, new way of playing with a lot of spin, etc... and the best proof is that I am now beating a friend I could never beat before, despite having solely trained in VR!\n\nAs far as multiplayer is concerned, Eleven is excellent because you generally get very low latency due to the use of p2p technology ( instead of using relays like racket fury does). So you end up being able to play with anyone around the world. I live in Germany and regularly play with people from the UK, France with very low ping ~25ms to 35ms ... but I also play with people in the USA with ~115ms ping and the game is rock stable.\n\nAlso, Table tennis is even more fun in VR because you you can try any kind of strokes and... are not running after the balls :-) You have various AI to train with and most and foremost, you have what feels like an infinite pool of talented player online with various styles that you will not even find in your local table tennis club.

It wasnt showing up even though we were connected via Social in the Quest. We had to go to the Everybody List and wait a while to find each other in the list. It took a long time to refresh.\n\nI was worried, because it only showed 1 red bar to his name, and there was only some other stranger with 3 yellow bars, and everyone else was 1 red bar - nobody with green bars. But I sent a challenge anyway and it worked! We had an average ping of 200-230ms which isnt great but we tried anyway. And guess what?? It was still awesome! Some help with what ping offset is might be nice we didnt try that as it seemed like that would add more delay? There were glitches however. Like double bounces on opponents side and then they suddenly hit it back.\n\nI assume theres a ton of prediction going on on what to display for your opponent when theres latency. This could be fixed up I hope!! The other big thing that will help if you play this ACROSS THE WORLD, is if, during a heated match, you avoid looking at your opponents head or paddle, and keep your eyes on the ball only that will help. Otherwise you think theyre going to hit it one way, and you get surprised by the ball hit somewhere else. When things get heated with latency in the mix, try and pretend that the only accurate position is from the net to you. Try and ignore their side of the table a bit. So once you hit it over to your opponent, keep your eye on the ball and look for it coming back from the net to be able to play well.\n\nOverall Its still very fun, and super low friction to get playing. Dont fully get the table positioning mechanic. It works sometimes?\n\nThe one, vaguely stereotypical song gets annoying. Please give options for other music. I like that the ball hit sounds different when its hits the couch or tv, or rolls. The TV scoreboard is nice, but Id like an option for a voice announcer (ideally as a friend that talks rather than a sports announcer type). Also strong haptics when you hit the ball and a louder sound emanating from your paddle hit would be better.\n\nAlso at end of a game, it moves on too fast and if it was a close game you dont know who won as it cleared the tv scoreboard too fast. You obviously can find out if you hit the menu button, but some celebratory sounds or animation would be nice.\n\nI was worried this would be like a lame Wii ping pong game, but its soooo much better and very close to the real thing with the physics!\n\nBut once you get into this game, its SO REAL that you gotta be careful!! I almost leaned on the table a few times while playing and almost fell through to the floor. Also Im super paranoid about diving for long shots and watching my Guardian boundaries when going for tough hits.\n\nI totally recommend Eleven!! Cant wait to see updates, and play more international table tennis with my friends!\n\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseApr 9 at 7:11 AM\n\nhi samxr, thanks for the long review :). We pushed a patch yesterday which broke the friends list a bit, we'll push a fix today. Regarding the multiple bounces on the opponent's side..that is not really avoidable and is inherent to an online real time game with latency. Also, about not knowing how to serve - the tv tells you the reason you lose the point...also if you serve in front of the line, scary red x's appear all over. Did this not come up?...or were you triggering void point? Did you go through the tutorial - which explained how to serve. me:carrotstien discord:https://discord.gg/v8bwdwf email: carrotstien@gmail.com --- update, patch pushed...you should be able to see friends now", "TedMcTedfaceJun 2 at 12:30 PM\nGood but glitchy as hell\n\nMechanics seem good and you quickly get right into playing a game which is its best quality.

But something is odd with the physics once you start trying to hit the ball harder. I can play long rallies with world class difficulty as long as the hits are moderately soft and wouldnt force you to stand too far from the table. But once you hit a hard return and stand back to prepare for the next shot, the ball often disappears from view when it is coming my way (with the point going to the AI) or when I swing fast, it just goes through the ball, like my arms got shorter somehow. First couple of times I attributed it to me being bad, but it happens consistently once the game picks up the pace with hard hits. If I just play safe returns, it just never misses. Hope the team can work out these few wrinkles out to have it become a 5 star game. Keep up the good work.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 6 at 4:56 PM\n\nwhen you swing hard, the platform tracking accuracy drops.

Although this game is great, it is not without its flaws. Just as a P.S., I play club level table tennis in real life so these grievances are going to be from the perspective of an actual competitive player.\n- First off, the bot. The bot puts an insane amount of side spin on the ball for the stroke it does. It's completely unrealistic. There is also little to no curve before the ball hits the table, so there is no tell as to how much side spin is on the ball. Either the stroke has to be made more obvious, the stroke has to be fixed, or make it curve more in the air. I suggest fixing the stroke of the bot by making it emulate some professional European players.\n- When the bot switches between forehand and backhand sides, the bot completely switches hands. It is doing a forehand stroke on both sides. If you fix it, you should also allow players to choose between right-handed bot and left-handed bot.\n- It feels like the bot is not affected by the sidespin I put on my serves at all. Even when I put heavy spin on the ball (and I'm on the max spin setting), it bounces off the bot's paddle like it has no spin.\n- Add a timer between the end of a point and when a player can serve. Too many times have lost a point right after the previous point when I'm halfway across my room. I suggest around 4-5 seconds and maybe making it optional in settings\n(Running out of characters, will be very brief with the rest)\n- Opening menu after getting a notification should open directly to notification screen. Way too annoying to click on the tiny icon every time.\n- Laser pointer should default to non-dominant hand after a match (I play penhold, so it's awkward choosing with the same hand).\n- Adding a filter to only get match invites from players that are only above a certain rating\n- Maybe enfore 16cm toss more, but casual players might not like it\nDespite these flaws, it's still a great game!\n\nHelpful | 4", "nimitharJul 19 at 10:37 PM\nGreat game with some bugs\n\nFantastic game.

Im no professional ping pong player, nor an amateur by any means, but I feel like you can probably get pretty good at 11VR and translate your skills enough to real life.\n\nI guess my only gripe would be I wish the online multiplayer mode was a little smoother. May be my internet connection, but I found a lot of times where right after the serve, there would be a delay, and then the ball would just appear inches away, forcing me to quickly react, and losing that volley about 80% of the time.\n\nIm sure it only gets better from here though with updates.

Immediately the game felt so immensely real that when I hit the ball in the net, I wanted to lean against the table to grab the ball....except there was no table. Luckilly I could keep myself from actually falling. So talking about immersiveness, this game is exactly what that word means. Moreover because of the haptic feedback. That subtle tick when the paddle hits the ball. EXACTLY how it feels in real life table tennis. So since I got the Quest I was hoping with all my hopes that this game would come to the platform, so when I got a message yesterday that it hit the store I immediately bought it. Without any hesitation. And no regrets. This port is a one to one copy from the PCVR version. I can't see or feel any difference. I already had Racket Fury as there was no better alternative earlier on, which is also good, but with having the choice between Eleven and Racket Fury, I would recommend Eleven as it looks and feels more natural. So , if you are a table tennis enthousiast or just like the game already in real life, buy this one. You won't regret it. I can assure you that.\n\nThe only remark I have to make to the developers is that the menu is somewhat confusing here and there and it's not exactly clear what everything means or what the effect of a setting is. Looks a bit of a last minute thing and it definitely needs some polishing.

Its been a long time since I played in real life, but I could mostly rely on muscle memory. The only complaint I and others had was that the racket wasn't where we instinctively thought it was, making us miss shots that we felt like we should have hit. Hard to say exactly why that's the case, and it didn't take long to get used to, but its worth noting. Aside from that, I can't fault the accuracy at all.\n\nHowever this loses a star because clearly so much time has gone into the simulation that very little has been left over for the actual gameplay. The only single player modes are 3 very basic mini games, and a quick match against the AI. There's no campaign, objectives, or variation of any kind. The AI also seriously needs work, as the developer has acknowledged. It doesn't behave like a normal person. Fast balls stump it constantly while no other kind of tricky shot seems to phase it at all. It seems to know exactly how to move in order to hit the ball perfectly, and just randomly flubs the shot based on its skill level and the balls speed. You can perfectly predict whether your shot will land on the table based on whether the AI even moves. The menu system also feels very early-access.\n\nDespite all of that, I have come back to this one quite frequently since buying it, simply because its quick to get into and satisfying to play. This isn't a game that holds your hand. If you've not played much table tennis, it will take practice to even reliably hit the ball back onto the table. And there's something addictive about that.

We can try to update it to match the oculus system pattern...but we also want the user to be able to, in certain parts of the menu, toss the ball..so we'll see --- 3) yes I agree, it's on the todo list-- 4) you can go into paddle settings and adjust the paddle surface parameters; speed and spin. --- 5) I intend to eventually let single player mode have rules you can just toggle on and off.

The top priority is realism, and if something is wrong, that we aren't aware of, we'll be more than happy to fix it...so please stop by and drop a message. --- i guess what i'm trying to say is, there has been a loooot of work put into this game, and I think something was wrong with your experience compared to the experience we intended. I think if you give us a chance to work with you and troubleshoot issues you may have had, you'll find it worth your while. --Roman --update pushed..what do you think?", "SoRetroSosFeb 27 at 9:46 AM\nEssential Game for the Quest\n\nI consider this to be a must have for the quest.

Ping-Pong without having to own and make space for a table, invest in equipment, or chase down the balls. Physics seems spot on and the sound is perfect. Awesome! (now I want a disc golf game :) )\n\nJust two requests for developers:\nI like the optional environment (chalet) rather than the default environment but the game keeps defaulting to the default environment when I restart the game. If it could remember the previous setting that would be great.\nIt's been awhile since I've played ping-pong. I didn't remember how to serve properly and the (AI, single player) game was not registering faults the way I was serving so the score was frozen. I had to go online to find out what I was doing wrong. I also keep serving too far forward. If you could add a tutorial or at least a text description of the rules and how the scoring is done that would be great. If it's already in there, I couldn't find it.\nOtherwise, great game.

Try playing the fury in simulation mode, not arcade, and you will see that the difference is not that big. The 11's major disappointment is the ball feel which is awful. It is much heavier than a real tennis ball to such an extent that it feels like playing table tennis with a golf ball. Why all those dimples on the ball's surface? Should it not be smooth? If the devs could answer these 2 questions, it would be very helpful because I don't get it.\n\nThe only reason I bought the 11 is because it is easy to find an opponent.

It has taken me quite a lot of playing to start beating the opponent on the lowest levels\n- the scoring log in 1 player mode is quite basic ... for example the games can't be arranged into sets, and there are no additional stats such as longest rally, total game time, average number of points scored etc.\n- if you place the ball on the paddle, it falls straight through it. This may be necessary to avoid glitches or cheating when serving, but it loses some of the realism.\n- the game has occasionally crashed mid-game (and closed down)\n- the in-game music (which can be switched off) starts to get very repetitive...needs more tracks\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMar 2 at 12:01 PM\n\nhello, thanks for your review. I just want to comment on \" if you place the ball on the paddle, it falls straight through it.\" It's more that if you place the ball such that it's surface is inside the paddle surface, then it will fall right through. If you place it just above, it will not fall through. You can then roll the ball around on the face, and let it slowly roll off the surface.

After playing for a bit this is what I have run into.\n1) Game suddenly freezes up and kicks me out to my home screen, this has happens multiple times, to the point of frustration.\n2) When serving the ball, it double taps the paddle thus losing a point. This also happens sometimes in game play. (This said I am trying to see if it is the way I am playing that is causing that)\n3) Ball goes through the paddle sometimes. (Again am seeing if it is the way I am playing).\n\nI don't know if others have similar issues or not. I do understand this just came out so there is perhaps a bit of tweaking to do.

If you are double tapping, but it's within one short time, please let me know (see below) 3. this has to do with how oculus does tracking. We are aware of this, and will try to fix it soon.

I think table tennis vr is some of the most immersive experiences you can have in VR but that also means the physics have to be on point.\nRacket Fury and Eleven are both surprisingly good physics wise. You have to get used to it but after a few hours it feels natural, that already is a great accomplishment.\n\nFrom a simulation perspective I like Eleven a bit better, less arcady and less buggy online so far.\n\nHere are the issues I have so far in gameplay:\n\n- High balls which are considered a 100% in real life way too often go wide after a smash\n- Tracking issues on forehand while performing a top spin without looking at the ball\n- Hard to get the right angle for a backhand topspin on a lower ball, way too often lands in the net\n- missing the ball (especially forehand), ball flies through paddle\n\nIf those issues could get fixed we have the perfect table tennis simulator!\n\nAnd for the love of god, please work on the ugly menus and the overall presentation. It took me a while to understand how to save presets or how to play online. In this area Racket Fury looks way more polished.

It's a great game but there's some floors which really annoy me.\n\n1. The easy mode so is not easy, yes it doesn't do crazy power shots, but it feels like to beat him I need to do a powershot. Since I'm new in more focusing on getting it to the other side more then getting him out, but even on 0 difficulty he never misses, and yes he does sometimes, but you can clearly tell that it was on purpose. Like they will have perfect shots all the time then suddenly the smash one to the other side of the room in 1 swing. Like I had times where I hit the ball to him and back like 20 times before I messed up.\n\n2. Sometimes the bot hits it on the net, but it rolls to my side and I lose. Like how am I supposed to get that, before I can even start running I'm out\n\n3. The ball has gone through my racket thing multiple times, it gets annoying\n\n4. The whole game feels really good and realistic till you look at the ai, it fly's to the roof or goes in the floor and table sometimes and it ruins the immersion\n\nNow some suggestions\n\n1. Add a training mode to teach new players the basics,\n\n2. Allow me to select with my racket hand\n\n3. Allow people to 3d model environments them import them into our games, like custom oculus homes\n\n4. Either let people 3d model and import or have your own modellers to design helmets, I feel it will add more life to the game with custom helmets\n\nOverall the game is great and I really enjoy it, it was worth the money and fun to play, I hope they add more updates to make it that much better\nIf you want to look at the positives look at like every other review\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseFeb 29 at 10:33 PM\n\nthanks so much for the long review regarding your issues 1. yea we'll be adding ways to help absolute beginners 2. that is just something that happens in real life pong.

I've played a lot of racket fury (simulation mode) and it took a little while while to get adjusted to this game's feel. Now that I've become accustomed to Eleven's gameplay, I really like the overall physics of the game. This game is a much more accurate replica of the real thing. The feel and sound of the ball hitting the paddle and bouncing off the table are perfect. Where this game shines even more is in the environmental details. The room you play in is completely believable unlike racket fury's. The layout and the way things are arranged gives it a truly lived in feel. What's more impressive are the smaller details like the shadows made by the ball and paddle on the floor and table.\n\nThe reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to a few minor issues that I think are fixable.\n\nWhile the sound made by the ball hitting the table is great, the way it flies and bounces with spin can be exaggerated. This issue increases with the amount of spin applied and the length of the rally. Another thing that would help the overall gameplay is to give the user more custom adjustments to the way the paddle reacts to the ball. The options presently available might be enough if the range from min to max was increased.

Devs: a lot of people just want to play solo, on their own terms and schedule, but I guess you just really didn't have time for us. I've read about the beautiful environments we can play in (a vast desert, a balcony overlooking a stunning winter landscape, etc.) but in solo play (meaning \"you vs. an A.I. opponent\"), you're stuck playing in a cramped loft apartment of someone who apparently doesn't even know how to make their bed. I can adjust every tiny aspect of the table and the paddle, I can make them bright dinosaur purple if I so choose, then why can't I choose my environment? I'm forced to play against an avatar that looks exactly like the one I originally chose in the main Quest settings. Even though I can make my own appearance in the game look like a creepy rabbit if my heart so desires -- so why can't I customize the appearance of my A.I. opponent? Conclusion: If you only plan to play online opponents, have a great time, knock yourself out -- but if you're like me and want the option to play offline, on your own terms, beware. Your lack of options will leave you feeling like a second-class citizen, someone whom the devs, apparently, just couldn't be bothered about. I'd love to be able to change this review at some point.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseMar 13 at 7:26 PM\n\nHi youknowwhoiam. Thanks for taking the time to write out your review. Unfortunately there are a lot of things going on, and I understand how it looks to you. Regarding each of your comments: 1. we aren't setting single player in any less importance than multiplayer. The current AI is stopgap, and even so, is very complex. To say that we don't care, considering how much work was done on the AI, is unfair. 2. regarding the environment: the desert, museum, old winter, are environment from the previous version of the game. They were terribly underperforming for quest so we removed them as part of the revamp. The new game supposed to have the studio environment, and the chalet (mountain top wintery place you mentioned). Unfortunately, oculus quest is pretty finicky and was crashing for some users. We have temporarily removed that environment and are planning to bring it back today (along with a buuunch of changes). If you'd like to have it immediately, I'll be more than happy to give you an offline version of the game that has both environments. 3. Regarding how the studio environment looks...you can't please them all i guess. Some people want it neater, some people want it to look lived in. 4. Regarding the ai appearance. We were banking on Oculus finishing the oculus avatar to the point where users would be able to pick and choose what they look like however they want. Unfortunately, this hasn't happened, and the other masks you see, are a temporary option just to give additional variety for online presence (oh yea, and some avatars break the game for OTHER users...which is why we had to put in the masks). Either way, you are the first person, in my memory, to have such an issue with the AI's appearance. It's a pretty minor cosmetic thing, but I'll be happy to add the option to set AI appearance as masks in the next (not today's) release. I do hope you change your review because 1) the environment will be available today. The AI appearance can probably be made available within 2 days. Please reach out to me if you have any issues or concerns, comments, etc. Or even to just say hi. me:carrotstien discord:https://discord.gg/v8bwdwf email: carrotstien@gmail.com ----- PS: actually the majority of people play single player, not multiplayer; just saying that the game rating is not a function of happy multiplayer players only, or even primarily. --update pushed.

But there are some things that kill the immersion for me. First of all, Racket Fury is a great TT game but its more arcade compared to this one which is much more simulation like. I like both approaches. Where Eleven shines, is realistic play, gorgeous environments and a steep learning curve. Im a mediocre player (like probably most of us) so if theres a championship player who can keep up with the AI, congrats but youre not the normal target group. 2 bugs that were already present in the beta and are still not addressed: From time to time the ball bounces off the table in weird angles that are not realistic and worst of all, not predictable. Second of all the AI player shows a strange blurry hand movement. This occurs quite often and when it does he doesnt react at all to the ball. Dont get me wrong: this is an amazing game with great graphics and realistic feel but if youre like me and quit gaming because of bugs, thats a shame. Without these two bugs its a 5 star rating without a doubt. PS: this game is crossbuy. I bought it some time ago for the rift and got it for free on the quest.

So far I've only played 3 times (10 minutes each), but for me Racket Fury is streets ahead of Eleven Table Tennis in terms of fun and physical joy.\nEleven feels to me like the Simulation mode of Racket Fury, when many balls just don't get in and every time you try to speed up the top spins, the balls go out. Even when trying to play it safe with a sliced backhand, the ball doesn't go in as easily as it should.\nPlease note I'm a highly experienced table tennis player, and to me the Arcade mode in Racket Fury replicates the real shots extremely well. Yes of course, it's not hugely realistic, but it's not sci-fi either (it's like it maximizes a lot your natural skills... but you still need to have some in order to hit the ball correctly).\nI'd really appreciate an Arcade mode in here, because at the moment it feels pretty boring and dull and not accurate at all.

Its physics are unrivalled and its player base ranges from amateurs to professionals, all looking to either compete or teach you if youre new to the sport.\n\nThe ball and racket react the same way they would in real life, and without cables its a fantastic experience. Being able to chat with your opponent brings a social aspect as well which is very nice.\n\nI have been playing Eleven for a long time on steam with a PCVR kit and was excited to see it on the Quest store.\n\nA lot of what is in the PC version is there and the graphics took only a small hit. The 30hz difference between my PCVR kit and the Quest does make it a bit more difficult to follow the ball however.\n\nThose are all the great things i have to say about Eleven. If youre an old pro or someone whos never played before youll find fun in this game EXCEPT:\n\nWait. This game has a game breaking bug. Sometimes in multiplayer your serves will not go through and thus the opponent will score every time.\n\nIm experienced in Table Tennis, i know how to play and how to serve properly.

Don't get me wrong, I love multiplayer and all seems good so far but feel it should have a single player campaign to make it complete.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 18 at 8:15 AM\n\nhello John-De-Rienzo, If you mean a curated series of AI levels for which you can play through - that isn't there yet. This is less gamified at the moment - and primarily the stress is on accurate simulation. You are able to play single player games vs the AI, and change the AI difficulty very easily. Any campaign like game would likely be added, but not likely soon. me:carrotstien discord: https://tiny.cc/vr11 email: devs@forfunlabs.com", "robert.keat.1Mar 4 at 7:23 PM\nPlay with friend\n\nI want to play with a friend of my, but I am unable.

This game is definitely a keeper!\n\nHelpful | 1", "fruiMar 24 at 3:40 AM\nRealistc physics, gameplay needs work\n\nUpdate 2: I have added one star to my original three star score which I now consider to be too harsh. Still I wish the gameplay could be improved. The physics is very real, but realism doesn't translate directly into fun. You can realistically emulate a world champion, but it will not be fun to play with him. You need to accustom to all level of players and let the game flow.\n\nUpdate: Yes the physics is spot on. What I am complaining is the playing style. The AI is too much a chopper that is chopping all the time and the ball from the AI is spinning too much and too often. This is not the case in real life. I have been playing Ping Pong for over 40 years. Players don't do so much chopping either in professional or amateur games. In professional tournament it's not effective against strong players. In amateur play it can be fun for a while but too much chopping will spoil the flow and decrease the fun. Maybe you can add more chopping behavior above \"Advance\" level. At least for intermediate players too much chopping from the AI can be very annoying even if the physics is accurate.\n\nI have been playing the Steam version for several years and I really love it. The Quest version has kept the realistic physics, but it has some downside as regards gameplay. The most negative change: the AI now hits the ball with too much spin, and this makes the direction of the ball very hard to predict, and the game much more frustrating and less fun. The AI makes a lot of spin even at the \"Normal\" difficulty setting. In reality there isn't so much spin, and the player can judge the direction of the spin according to the opponent's hand movement so as to make preparation in advance, but in ETT this prediction is not possible as the AI doesn't make any chopping movements. So I suggest decreasing the spin from AI. Of course it would be great if there is an option to adjust the playing style of AI (how much spin, smash, etc.), but for now simply decreasing the spin from AI is enough.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMar 22 at 3:46 PM\n\nHello. Thanks for your review. The way the AI hits, is 100% what would happen if you hit the ball that way. As in..there is no special logic of \"when ball hits ai paddle, do this <>\". The AI is actually moving a paddle. We will be working on improving the AI's strokes to be more human shaped..I think maybe that is what is throwing you off? would love to hear back from you: me:carrotstien discord:https://discord.gg/v8bwdwf email: carrotstien@gmail.com", "ImJustBetter06Mar 3 at 3:34 PM\nCant play.\n\nSo i was logging on to the game and for some reason it doesnt run, I had to restart my whole system because it legit crashed it.

Only reason it's not 5 stars is more to do with space & hardware. Unless you have a really big space you'll find yourself unable to get truly lost in it due to the worry of smashing your face/arm/controller into the wall. This is mainly due to the hardware. I have enough space to play comfortably but because the quests inside out tracking over time loses where the table was set at you find yourself edging closer to your bounderies & having to recentre.
