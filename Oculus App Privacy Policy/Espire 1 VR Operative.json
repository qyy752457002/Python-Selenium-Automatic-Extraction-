The Game crashed a lot and the missions were super long and that to me just wasnt my type of game. I tried to refund it and the refund was denied so I redownloaded the game and Its pretty fun I didnt realize the challenges were there and that this game has a lot more weapons than meets the eye. Overall I would recommend this game to any stealth shooter lover.

Thanks ever so much for the awesome review and rating! :) We're eternally grateful to you for giving us a second chance, thanks so much for that and we're pleased you could get along with the challenges more over the main campaign. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "Chop.Chop111Jul 15 at 9:27 AM\nA MUST have title!\n\nI got this game thinking it was going to be one mission and that was it done and might be a shooting rage or something but then there are like 7 missions to do and I was shocked!\n\n\nThe game works the best it is the best shooter game on the quest it has many things to do I have not done everything on it yet and I have played like 2 hours and I only got it yesterday!\n\nThe only thing you could improve on is the cheats make it so you do not have to unlock them but you have to do the mission first to get cheats.\n\n\nI also think the game has the best graphics and the bots are smart and they respond to everything and it feels realistic!\n\nHelpful | 28\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 12:21 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks ever so much for the awesome review and we're overjoyed to hear you love our title! :) For you to brand our game as the best shooter on quest is very humbling so thanks again for that. We wanted to make unlocking the cheats similar to how they're unlocked on something like goldeneye whereby you have to do requirements to unlock them. It also adds replayability with the current method we've devised but we'll take what you said on board. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "cimage14 days ago\nOne of the best titles for the Quest\n\nUPDATE: I still love this game, and it's definitely the best QUEST stealth experience you can have to date, but several months down the road since I bought this and there are still some really frustrating bugs. Enemies detect you at times that they shouldnt be able to and this time, it cost me a hostage. The ammo clips still bug out on you at times and you can't properly reload your gun, which becomes an aggravation if you get caught by an enemy and have to take out an armored dude quickly with just a silenced pistol, and it suddenly runs out of ammo after 1 shot during the attack, even though it said it had 15 shots before it needs reloading. It really does hinder the experience. This game has so much potential, but there are still issues to iron out before it's a home run. One positive note, however, is the game does a little better job at guiding the player on what to do next, and it now tells you how many of which challenges you must complete outside the missions before you may continue the campaign, whenever you reach certain points in the story, so thanks devs on that one! But in the \"Ventilation\" mission, where you first encounter drones, the people on your team don't really tell you what to do about that situation. They just pretty much say, \"oh, f***\" and make you figure it out. I didn't know if I was supposed to wait in the vents until all the drones left or fight all of them at once or what. Took me a while to figure it out, but I learned they never leave the area, so I eventually tried sneaking out the vents quickly before the drones arrive and that worked ok. All in all, you won't regret buying this game, just know that it has it's fair share of shortcomings.\n\n\n(Original review)\nI read a lot of reviews, seeing how people were saying there were a lot of bugs, but the devs have been highly responsive to these issues and apparently, a lot of them have been fixed since then. I also was unsure of the price, with the game involving these issues, but after countless positive things said about it, regardless, I decided to give it a shot. And I am extremely glad I did.\n\nThis game is possibly the best one I have had the pleasure of owning for my Quest! Amazing stealth gameplay and I love being able to climb up walls and such. There's just a few bugs that could be worked out.\n\nOne particularly upsetting one I recently experienced was with the ammo mags for the dart gun. For some reason, every time I would grab mags in mission 1.3, they would disappear on me. My gun wouldn't reload except but for 1 dart, and then 2 full mags I just picked up suddenly vanished from my belt. It was like the game was straight up robbing me of the ammo I just grabbed. This was very frustrating because it forced me to use loud weapons, thus killing the full stealth experience. And I really need those darts in this mission because there are A LOT of enemies here, just spread out all over the map, and it's really not smart to just go full-on assault mode. Devs, please look into this! If it's fixed, I'll give it 5 stars for sure\n\nThere's also the minor bug of climbing. Sometimes you're going up a wall on grabbable things like pipes and rails, and then you grab for the next part of said pipe or rail, but the game doesn't read your grabbing command properly and you fall.\n\nOne other slight annoyance I found was there's not a lot of clarification of what to do next to progress the story missions after you beat mission 1.2. I actually had to Google it to figure out what I was supposed to do (you have to do at least 1 of every category of challenge missions, plus all 3 climbing challenges, to progress the story the first time). I don't think it's a good look when the player has to look up how to get back to the story. I also felt like these challenges were forced on me and should have remained as additional content alone, instead of a requirement to continue the story missions. If it must be a requirement, then it would be better to force just 1 or 2 challenges on the player to get their feet wet with the training simulations as a proper introduction to this part of the game vs. making them go through like, 8 of the challenges just to progress through the main game. And a notice at the bottom of the screen when you're at the main menu that says something like \"complete x amount of challenges to resume missions\" would have been very helpful.\n\nAll of that being said, these things only put a slight damper on the experience, while the game still remains a lot of fun. But the game robbing me of ammo was the worst and I really hope you guys fix this issue. But, overall, I highly recommend this game! It's well worth the money.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nHi there! First and foremost we want to sincerely thank you for providing us with continuous updates to your reviews. It certainly helps us as a team identify areas of any potential improvement so thanks for that and thanks for sharing your views. :) In terms of the AI we have to be honest and say we haven't made any updates in regards to their behaviour for a while and we appreciate there are times in the game where an enemy can unreasonably detect you in a few different scenarios where they shouldn't be able to. We'll take this on board and look at potentially improving this. In terms of the reloading, again it's something we apologise for however there is a way of automatically reloading your gun as a work around should you get into a situation that requires immediate reloading. If you just swipe the weapon across your belt it should automatically reload for you. We hope that helps as a compromise for now. In terms of the drone mission (1.5) we appreciate there wasn't too much in the way of instructions going on before the start of the mission and again we apologise. We can shed a little light though on how those drones work. Basically you've got the giant drone which attempts to shoot you down as you attempt to escape it and those mini drones you see act as markers and when they're locked on to you it guides the giant drone as to where your position is so you definitely did the correct thing by escaping quickly and to always move as if you constantly move you dont give the jefferson drone much chance of finding you as the mini drones are constantly chasing and looking to see where you are. You can decide to stay and fight the drones but it requires again a lot of movement and patience. You can even take down the jefferson drone by shooting the sides of it. Youll know when youfe affected it too as you'll see the drone shake slightly. If you do decide to stay and destroy it before escaping we advise shooting it then moving out of sight, possibly take out some of the mini drones temporarily so the jefferson has no way of finding you then take another shot and keep repeating until you've destroyed it. Also if you destroy the jefferson drone there is an incentive in doing so as you can unlock a cheat by doing it as it's an Espire trial. :) Good luck if you decide to go down that route and thanks again for your continued support. We hope our advice helps. :) Thanks for playing!", "KaRaKaToS5 days ago\nVery good game but..\n\nThe game is very good, nice story and quite long duration for a VR shooter.\nAlso the climbing is a great feature.\nBut i love to play with pistols (not the stun pistol) or with the rifle. But you will NEVER find ammo for normal pistols or the rife.... this was very disappointing.\nYou find ammo for the stun gun and enemies drop ammo for SMG and shotguns.\nWhat about the pistols and rifle? Why did you even add them to the game if you can't find ammo...\n\nHelpful | 2", "EmberEggJun 14 at 7:59 PM\nGreat Game, a few bugs\n\nOverall this is a great game. Most levels are fairly large and you can complete objectives in any order. Also every level can be completed either using stealth or just going in guns blazing. Four stars mainly because there are a few bugs that prevent you from completing some trials.\n\nPros\n+ there is a high amount of replay value. Each mission has a few extra trials you can complete. You can also earn badges in missions, but the badges pretty much only reward stealth.\n+ levels are large and most allow you to explore and have multiple paths you can take to complete it. It doesnt feel you like you are on a forced path.\n+ controls are good but it can be adjusted (it can take a few tries to get the placement of guns, ammo and repair tool just right)\n+ fun and graphics are good for the quest\n+ 6 missions and a bunch of challenges (mini-missions to test your skills)\n\nCons\n- there are at least 2 trials that cant be completed. The devs admit the ones involving taking dolls/statues to a specific spot broke in the last update.\n- there are several types of guns (tranquilizer, pistols, assault rifles, and shotguns) but the different versions you pickup all feel about the same. They have about the same damage, fire rate and ammo clip capacity. Would have been nice to different attributes so each gun is more unique.\n- would be nice to have checkpoints. You can abort a mission and resume it close to where you left off. But youll lose the guns you had and Im not sure trials or other achievements will count. If youre going for stealth being able to not lose all progress if you get spotted would help.\n- general bugs and game freezes. About 25% of the time the game crashes on startup. Sometimes pipes and other climb able surfaces dont grab right. Not all achievements seem to complete correctly.\n- some surfaces look climbable but arent\n\nHelpful | 26\nDeveloper ResponseJun 19 at 12:54 AM\n\nHi there! First and foremost thanks ever so much for the awesome rating and highly detailed review we really apppreciate it! :) We're delighted you enjoy the game and take advantage of the variety of choices we offer about going through each situation. In terms of the bugs we do apologise about that and it did indeed come about as a result of our last update. We as a team are fully aware of it and we're actively trying to fix it so achievements will be obtainable again in a future patch. Also in terms of the surfaces Espire is only capable of climbing surfaces which are metallic, any other materialed surface won't register. In terms of the climbing not always registering you're not the only one to mention this and we've took this on board. In terms of the gun attributes it's a great suggestion and we thank you for the idea. :) We'll take it all on and try to inprove the game even further.

As you progress you gain new guns such as a couple shot guns, smgs and pistols but the levels arent redesigned very much and the dialogue and how you play the game gets really repetitive.

There's a number of players who love the challenge of it but of course if you find it far too difficult then it won't seem as fun. We definitely recommend making use of all of Espire's abilities during this mission especially considering how heavily armoured the guards are. Being as stealthy as possible is definitely advised. In regards to the sequel we do have huge ambitions of developing one in the future and it's something we would absolutely love to do! Nothing is set in stone though as there are a few hurdles we have to overcome but we really hope we can get there. Thanks for playing Espire! :)", "Zombie_Dude8 days ago\nGreat game but one flaw...\n\nI love how this game is in a mix of the terminator and metal gear and I loved the concept of stealth. I had a few problems with the game though. I wish whenever you do a holdup with an npc that it makes sense to let the box to have a code to help you get to the next level or some sort of item. It would be better if you could make the npc walk with you to your desired location. This is my only problem with the game.

Thanks for the awesome review and rating and we're super happy you love the game! :) Metal gear was certainly one of our biggest influences when developing this title and the whole premise was taking aspects from franchises such as that and converting them into VR. :) In terms of your suggestions we thank you for them and certainly an awesome idea having guards walk with you effectively taking them hostage. :) Sadly however I think this may be scope for a potential sequel as it would be difficult to change the mechanics with guards drastically in this current game and may have an unstable impact on the game overall. We would definitely love to incorporate some ideas from the community into a potential sequel should we be lucky enough to make one in the future so again thanks for the suggestion and we'll take it on board. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "TTV_Pinguting21 days ago\nVery good game\n\nEspire 1 is a great stealth game that i would recomend to fans of stealth game\n\nPros: great mechanics, easy navigation, fun, Different kinds of weapons, voice commands.\n\nCons: Sometimes you grab the wrong weapon, voice commands feel a little slow\n\nConclusion: buy if you like stealth games\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nHi there!

For example I still don't know how to use that guide thing to show me the way when i am lost. Also, I can pick up the camera from one of my hands and throw it, but I don't know really what the use of it, or if it was supposed to do something, I haven't figured it out yet! Any guidance will be most appropriated!\nThank you for the good work devs!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome and constructive review. We're really happy to hear you love the game but apologies if you found certain aspects a little difficult to understand. We would love to advise further on some of these. The repair tool which is situated on your chest is a multi functional tool which you can use to repair yourself if you take damage. To find out if you're damaged simply grab the repair tool off your chest and you should see some small red nodes in front of you. If you see only a few specs then the damage is minimal however if you see a good few and they're rather large it means your damage is reaching a critical point and a repair needs to be done ASAP. In either case simply use the repair tool and hover it above the nodes and then pull the trigger and it should reduce the nodes until they disappear and thus repairing yourself back to normal. :) The tool also can be used as a way finder helping in guiding the way to your next mission objective. Simply drop the tool on the floor and you'll see a blue line emerge. Simply follow that and it will take you to where you're supposed to go next. We hope that helps in regards to your confusion about the repair tool. :) In regards to the cameras there's a good few neat tricks you can do with this. We appreciate we didn't exactly cover any if none of the tricks the cameras offer and we apologise about that. It's definitely something we could potentially amend. The hand cams can be accessed on either hand, you have one on your left and one on your right. You can access these cameras by holding down the trigger (without holding a gun in your hand) and it will bring up a small camera feed showing your environment depending on where you're moving the camera on your hand. One feature the camera can do is mark enemies. If you hover the camera over any number of enemies a small tag will appear above them as you'll find out if you try it. It comes in handy as you can then monitor their movements and be aware of where they are at all times. Another thing you can do is slightly more advanced but very cool is to use the camera to lure enemies out of their typical movements so you can strike and take advantage without doing it in plain sight. If you hold the trigger and access the camera, keep the trigger pressed down and with your other hand grab the camera with the grip button and you'll find yourself holding the camera. Keep the trigger pressed down on the hand you used to activate the camera and throw the camera with your hand to a place you want to lure the guards or a single guard in question. On the mini camera feed you should see an audio button, hit that with the hand you used to throw the camera and the camera you've thrown will make a noise and alert the guards and you can then decide to take whichever action you wish. Kill, knockout, holdup etc it's up to you. :) You can also use the cameras to look around corners or blind spots. Simply repeat the steps I mentioned about throwing the camera only instead of hitting the audio button just use that hand to look around once you've thrown the camera and you should see whatever the camera is seeing in which you've thrown. We really hope all this comes in handy and if not or you have any other questions or issues feel free to hit us up on our discoed or Facebook page and we'll be happy to help further. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "Steve4719725 days ago\nWow!\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing!

In my opinion this is a must have!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Puerto-the-RicoJun 28 at 7:13 PM\nVR and Metal gear had a love child\n\nOnce upon a time metal gear and a VR headset went to lookout point and spent some time talking in the back of a 98 Camero. Fast forward and Espire 1 was born!\n\nThis game has been one of the best tactical shooters Ive played thus far. Whether your the quite professional or the kick the front door in and unleash a hail storm of bullets gun slinger. Your experience will undoubtedly be awesome.\n\nPros:\n\n1. tactical game play allows you to utilize your environment to get the drop on the enemy (literally) you can climb about them sneak up on them and either yell freeze or punch them out cold. Youll have a tranq dart gun as a non-lethal means of dealing with the OpFor. Later silenced weapons will become another option including a silence shotgun.\n\n2. Gun fights can get intense! At one point I found myself with two assault rifles in hand dealing with enemies coming from multiple directions when I ran out of ammo in one I threw it at one bad guy and popped the other. That experience alone left me with a grin for at least an hour.\n\n3. The world is your play ground. With so many paths to choose from and areas to climb your really able to take on any situation how you see fit.\n\n4. Challenges. These not only help sharpen your skills and give you a chance to test out some new tricks they overall increase your replay value.\n\n5. New free content: this is huge to me! I love developers who really make the game worth the money spent! With some games choosing to put out additional content ( that frankly was already a part of the game) for a fee. These guys reward their fans with updates and new weapons. Thanks for choosing to not go that route on monetization.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Assault rifle can be a bit on the harder side to control and accuracy can be hit or miss.\n\n2. Some walls are climbable and some arent. But design wise some times you cant distinguish the difference unless you try them all.\n\n3. Auto turret indestructible? I have yet to destroy one.\n\n4 the repair tool can sometimes be difficult to grab. This has actually cost me a few espire units in heated fights. Not a big deal could be calibration issues or whatever but might wanna check and make sure it isnt a bug.\n\n5. Speaking of bugs. On one level where I am required to acquire a key card to move on I found myself going through a vent only to fall into oblivion over and over. It seems like a render issue. Wish I could name the exact stage for you guys (its the first time you have to complete challenges to move on to the missions)\n\nOutside of that this game is well worth the purchase.\n\nTo the developers keep up the great work. Cant wait to see what else your team puts out. This style is definitely your knack!\n\nUpdate: wow you just blew my mind with this new information and it definitely will come in handy. Regarding the Assault rifle I learned it is in fact accurate you just cant go full rock and roll with it and expect it to be spot on. Like a real rifle it has recoil so be strategic about shots.\n\nHelpful | 13\nDeveloper ResponseJun 28 at 5:11 PM\n\nHi there! Thanks ever so much for the highly detailed and unique review! Loving the analogy regarding metal gear and VR haha! :D It's awesome to hear draw up comparisons between us and that legendary stealth franchise as well considering it was one of our major inspirations when developing Espire and translating aspects of that franchise into VR! :) It's great to see you taking advantage of the various playstyles and ultimately the level of freedom we provide players with across our missions and challenges and overall we're super happy you're enjoying the game and the abilities Espire possesses! :) In regards to some of the cons you experienced in the game we can advise on a few of those. In regards to the climbing you're correct in saying you can't climb every surface, Espire can only climb metallic surfaces so if you come across any surface which doesn't seem metallic then you probably wont be able to climb it, it's worth trialling though just in case. :) The turrets was you quite rightfully say can't be destroyed however you can disable them by getting close to them (we advise crouching or getting behind one) and using the repair tool on it. This will shut it down, it's worth noting you can also use the repair tool to disable tripmines too in case you weren't aware and then you can pick the tripmines up, place it somewhere and reactivate them with the repair tool so guards can trip over them which looks awesome! :) If you're having troubles with grabbing the tool belt you can hit the left menu button on the left controller mid game and go into settings, recalibrate and you can recalibrateyour holster and repair tool from there. We hope that helps. :) There's been a couple of areas in certain levels that have pieces of the map missing and it's an issue we're aware of which we hope to possibly rectify in a future patch at some point.

We appreciate the suggestions regarding melee weapons however we don't think it's going to be something we'll be adding. As a work around you can always use your fists, guns and the repair tool. These can all work as melee weapons and there's lot of cool things you can do with each one such as throwing the repair tool and guns at guards for a quick KO or to use espire instinct from a height as you drop down from a higher surface and punch the guard straight in the face from above. Just a few examples. :) Speaking of time stop Espire instinct allows you to do just that. From mission 1.2 onwards you control the more upgraded Espire units with this feature and if you hold B it slows down time allowing you to maneuvre your way out of tricky situations or for added effects when killing or taking our guards. :) Hope all this helps.

Thanks ever so much for leaving us an overwhelmingly positive review! :) We purposefully invented the game to provide the player with as much freedom and options as possible about going through each situation and it's great to see youve familiarised yourself with the stealth or fight aspect to it. Fantastic to see! :) Crouching is definitely something we would encourage highly throughout the entire game as it helps whenever attempting situations stealthily such as attempting to sneak past guards or to get behind them and hold them up. If at times you walk past guards or near them without crouching they can hear your metallic footsteps which can trigger an alert so definitely crouch wherever possible. :) We're delighted to see you're making use of the hand cams too. We apologise we didn't go into too much depth about them however there's a few neat tricks we can also recommend to you in case you weren't already aware. :) You can use the cams to mark enemies but you can also activate the cam on one hand and as you're holding the trigger down if you use your other hand to grab the camera and throw it and then refer back to your mini screen and hit the audio button the camera you've thrown will make a noise and lure guards out if you wish to distract them or pull them away from a populated area where many guards might roam. :) Definitely comes in useful. We hope our little pieces of advice help you enjoy the game even more and learn a few new things and again we're delighted you love the game as much as you do already. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "chief3rd10 days ago\nGreat game\n\nUh, great game... What more is there to say\n5 stars, play it, experience it, share it if you already beaten it\nI play it with my shoes on a empty backpack on. try putting knee pads and suit up for when you play. i play this in the basement of an apartment building and its sick hearing your own shoes why running around as a robot. its weird but what can i say, this game is immersive as heck. but i would recommend anyone whose gonna play for long sessions to have some orgonite in their pocket on attached to their headset.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nHi there!

My only complaints are the ai being overall inaccurate,with wether or not the enemies see and hear things and how insanely quick they can make radio reports,and the fact that expires abilities are a bit underwhelming. Theres also this weird glitch where in hostage situations the ai is weirdly overpowered,being able to see from all angles and never taking time to go into searching form. Id love to see a sequel to this game with maybe even screen player adaptations and more features. The story is amazing and with a cliffhanger ending like that I would love to see a continuation. Some new features Id like to see are new weapons and maybe even new enemies,more cheats (cuz the previous ones are sooo fun to play with,) enhanced combat,perhaps a new set of espire units would be cool,maybe more interaction and dialogue with other characters other than just radio dialogue,and of course more abilities with a potential new espire unit. Of course slowing down time,seeing through walls and climbing anything made of metal is cool and all,but I wanna see like built in weaponization. And of course jumping. Overall,this game is amazing and I hopefully await a continuation\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nThat means a lot mate thanks!

Although if youre not good at stealth I would still recommend it. This game requires you to sneak in to a facility, take out guards, and upgrade the Espire unit.

Thanks for the awesome review and rating and we're delighted you love the game! :) We appreciate we left the ending on a bit of a cliffhanger however this was done with the intentions of potentially continuing the story in a sequel. We have nothing set in stone in terms of a sequel or whether it will be produced but we certainly hope so and we would love to continue the story in it should we be in a position where we can make one. :) For replayability and added general length to the game we highly recommend attempting the Espire trials. (Side missions) These can be found on the mission select screen in the main campaign if you look to the bottom left you'll see boxes and if you hover your controller over them it tells you how to go about achieving and passing them. Whenever you pass an Espire trial you unlock some super cool features and cheats you can apply for some added fun such as invisible Espire, tiny Espire, golden gun etc. We won't spoil anything for you but some of those cheats have some ultra cool effects and outcomes. :) In terms of shooting challenges pretty much all of them involve some degree of shooting especially if you wish to go loud in a lot of them. The weapons challenges allow you to use some exclusive firearms specifically for those types of challenges but we will take your opinion on board.

You can tell the developers have passion due to the updates it has received. The game has improved a ton! At first the graphics weren't the best which took away from the immersion, but now, it looks amazing; a lot better than some games we currently have on the Quest. Gameplay is exactly as most say in their reviews, you can choose to go all guns blazing, or be stealthy like in Metal Gear and it's great.

Espire 1 is one of the best VR games I've ever played. Unlike many of the other games currently out on Quest, this feels like a full console single player experience. It plays very similarly to the Metal Gear Solid games. The ability to climb almost any wall adds another dimension to the gameplay. The maps are large and the missions take time to beat. There's so many ways to get through a level, every playthrough feels different. If you like stealth action games, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response14 days ago\n\nHi there!

Thanks so much for leaving such a kind review, and we're so glad you're enjoying the game. Unfortunately the Quest version doesn't have blood effects, this is mainly due to performance limitations - sometimes there's 12 guards on-screen, and you can duel-wield any weapon, throw yourself and view the environment from any angle, use Espire Vision to see through walls and use your handcameras for a 2nd perspective. It was hard to get all of this running on the Quest and unfortunately some of the Particle effects (including blood) are not present. The PC and PSVR version of the game does have optional blood. Blood effects is something we hope to bring to a future Espire title since we are always continually trying to improve and it's clear from your review that players find it very important! Espire is a cross-buy game (you get the PC version for free) so if you ever get the chance to play the game on PC, the blood effects will be there.

There are many reasons to love Espire one being that you can say freeze and hold up your enemies and it has a seated mode and with my disabilities this allows me to play comfortably. I love that you have the choice to go out guns blazing and shoot everyone, hide their bodies or if you really want to you can just punch them or even stun them with your repair tool or you can just complete your objective by remaining undetected and use the stealth approach. You crouch through vents, zip line, climb basically anything and have the power of slow motion, who wouldn't want to play a game that offers all this in VR? The developers are constantly updating and very involved...bravo to them! The only small complaint that I have is unlike other games there is not a straightforward campaign you have missions that you complete which I love and then you have training challenges that you have to pass and you cannot continue with the rest of the game until you complete those challenges so it kind of stops you right in the middle if you get stuck. I would really like to see that eliminated it's great to have challenges but make it a choice not a requirement. I would recommend this game and worth the money for sure!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 12:22 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks ever so much for the awesome rating and highly detailed review!

The one thing is that my voice recognition has just stopped working, which takes out a big feature in the game.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response4 hours ago\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome review and rating! :) We apologise the voice recognition is a bit hit and miss. It became a little inconsistent as a result of our last major update we introduced back in May. We as a team are aware of it though and hopefully there will be some improvements to come at some point in stabilising it a bit more. For now however there are a few other ways you can hold up guards. As opposed to using your voice to hold guards up you can hold X as you get behind a guard and this will hold them up automatically. It isn't as cool as using your voice but it's a good compromise for now. A couple of other awesome methods you can choose to do include shooting the guns out of guards hands or even taking them (for example if a guard is about to walk past grab their gun and this will hold them up) If you use Espire instinct (slow mo) when you do this it can really add to the effects and make it look 10 times cooler too. :) We hope this advice helps.

Thanks ever so much for the awesome review and rating! There actually is a recharge time upon when you use any abilities or the repair tool. You'll notice there's an energy bar on your HUD which depletes as you use an ability or repair yourself. If you try to use Espire vision or any other ability the moment you've finished using one ability you'll notice it cant be done until the energy bar replenishes. In regards to the holsters we made it so you can't carry more than 3 weapons (4 if you include the repair tool which you can use a melee weapon or to throw) to simply provide a decent balance. If you could carry more weapons it would make the game far easier and \"too\" accessible to use a number of weapons at a time. You can always explore weapon racks, the machine guns enemies drop and the guns you can procure throughout each mission though if you wish to unlock new ones or use more. Just know you can't carry more than 3 at a time.

Thanks for providing us with a review and a great rating. :) In regards to the variety in weapons we actually do have a fair few that you can procure throughout the campaign, it may just be a case of the fact you haven't found them yet or haven't gotten far enough in the game. If you go on the campaign mission select screen you'll see images of guns that you can unlock in these levels and it's up to you to find them. Some are concealed in quite secret places you have to climb to or fling yourself across to whole others are a lot easier and more in plain sight but we intended to add this in to add variety and increase replayability. We can also recommend playing the weapon challenges on challenge mode if you want to try out a lot of different firearms as those challenges provide exclusive access to guns you wouldn't normally find anywhere else in the game. :) To add to what we've just outlined there's also the ability to unlock cheats. Again if you go to the mission select screen you'll see boxes on the left, if you hover your controller over them it will provide you with side missions to attempt in each main mission in the campaign and how to go about passing them. When you complete these side missions you can unlock some super cool features and cheats such as tiny Espire, invisible Espire and there's a golden gun cheat you can activate once that's unlocked which has a great impact when used on enemies. :) We really hope all this helps anyway and we hope it inspires you to go on a gun hunt in the main campaign. :) In terms of multiplayer Espire 1 is designed specifically to be a single player game and the in game mechanics and how everything works adheres to that. We sadly couldn't just add multiplayer into the game as it could cause a few potential problems with balance and how everything works and would also mean us having to pretty much transform the game completely. If we do add multiplayer it will be incorporated in a potential sequel which we hope we can make happen at some point in the future. Nothing is set in stone but that's where we want to get to.

First and foremost thanks ever so much for providing us with a nicely detailed review and rating. :) We can advise on a few of the issues you've brought up in your review. We've made many updates and tweaks over time since the launch back in November 2019 and in regards to your attempts at completing the me and my lucky charm challenge unfortunately that side mission is impossible to achieve currently due to it unexpectedly breaking as a result of our last update. We hope to fix this ASAP at some point in the future and we apologise about that. In regards to doing the compulsory challenges after a certain number of missions, again we apologise about that. Youre far from being the only one who's complained about it and again it's something we could possibly modify in the future to make optional. In regards to your issue about cheats you can always hit us up on our Facebook page or on discord regarding something specific. We're highly active in getting back and getting into discussions or answering questions when asked so would be more than happy to help. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "The_InfinituxJul 8 at 6:49 PM\nNice Starter\n\nWhen I first got my Oculus quest, this was one of those first games I wanted to get. I had a few good hours, and it was really enjoyable. However when I started getting on to games like Boneworks when I got my Oculus link cable, I came back somewhat disappointed. It is a great game for people who dont have an oculus link, but Ive been getting into more advanced games that are just a whole lot better than this. Besides that, I say its a really nice game to have if you new, showing the headset off to friends or family, and when you are away from home. Price is a little much when it comes to the story though but that might just be me.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 4:43 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome review and we're super humbled that you prioritised our game as one of your must plays when you bought the quest. :) In terms of your outlook on other games which are operated over the link cable or virtual desktop the games are naturally higher in graphical fidelity due to the fact there's a gaming PC running them. However in case you weren't aware we do have a rift version of Espire which you can download for free which of course has better visuals, more reflective surfaces, better physics etc. Espire 1 is cross buy enabled meaning if you buy either the quest or rift version you'll get the other version for free. :) It may benefit you to give it a try, that way you can play Espire at its full capabilities. Thanks for playing. :)", "jdice11Jul 17 at 11:11 AM\nGreat game but read first\n\nOk so I bought this game around a month ago and first off I love it. This game was buggy apparently when it first was released. But The bugs are mostly fixed The only one I have encountered is sometimes it will lose tracking and pause the game or crash.

You can activate it by going into settings, comfort and enable and disable it whenever you wish to. It restricts the view a fair bit but should stave off a bit of motion sickness. :) We're glad to hear you had fun anyway and we definitely recommend attempting to unlock the cheats, procuring all the weapons and trying out challenge modes to get a bit of steam replayability and challenge in. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "fire_ceiling42Jul 26 at 5:40 PM\nReally solid game\n\nI havent had this game for too long but already its extremely fun due to many interesting stealth mechanics and different possible play styles.

Picking up the holstered pistols gets confused with changing the magazine. Picking up things from the floor takes some effort and again confused with your own weapons/magazine.\n\nClimbing up sometimes gets tricky as not every wall is climbable & the blackout refresh when you get to the top sometimes gets clunky.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 24 at 12:26 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome rating and constructive feedback! :) In terms of changing the magazines on your weapons every gun has their own loading mechanic. The tranquilser pistol for example has to be reloaded after every shot you fire by pulling back the reloader at the back, machine guns you have to reach for some ammo on your belt and place it at the bottom of the machine gun etc however there is an easy way to reload if you prefer by just swiping your gun across the holster and it should automatically reload for you. We hope that makes it a little clearer and helps you out. Also in regards to the climbing you're correct in saying not every surface is climbable, it's only the metal surfaces which the Espire unit can climb. So if you plan to climb just ensure it's a metallic surface of some kind and you'll be good to go. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "Sir_RandoJul 14 at 1:07 AM\nGreat game, some minor issues\n\nI love stealth games. This is a great game and is a lot more freeform than it initially let's on. I wish there was a more concrete way of knowing how long an alert phase is going to last (think MGS alert timer) because of I enter a new area after being spotted I just end up endlessly waiting for alert to drop before continuing, it would be nice to see when it would end.\n\nMy only other major issue is that when I am doing a pistol, and I bring both hands together so I can support my aim the bottom of my dominant hand presses the grip button and repeatedly drops the magazine.\n\nI have also found on occasions that the freeze command either doesn't work or works too well and guards freeze when I walk up behind them without saying anything.\n\nI wish there was a checkpoint option just to make grinding areas for ghost medal easier... But I understand why it's. Not there\n\nAll that being said, the gameplay is great, you always feel like a super sneaky dude but you know you look a goon in your living room staring at a blank wall in the best possible way. This is a must buy for anybody who enjoys stealth gameplay, especially when the level design allows for a lot of creativity. You can climb over sight lines or use your repair tool as an auto distraction at any time, go in guns blazing or just stick to the floor and flawlessly exploit guard patterns\n\nNo game is perfect, but this is a great game\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 12:19 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks ever so much for providing us with a highly detailed review and awesome rating! :) Your idea about the alert phase is an awesome idea and funnily enough as obvious as it seems we havent seen anyone else mention it so we'll definitely take that on board. :) Your issue relating to the pistol I'm not sure if you have toggle to grip enabled or not but you should just need to hold the grip button to keep hold of the pistol. I'm assuming you have toggle to grip instead of hold to grip activated however so we'll take that on board. The freeze command has been a little hit and miss since our major update whic was implemented a while ago unfortunately and again it's something we as a team are aware of and we gooe to fix it at some point soon.

I personally really enjoy all the challenges they are not overly difficult. The gun mechanics in the game are superb and the Physics in it are spot on I feel that the energy bar should be a little bigger and a bigger variety in ways to to take people out the only ways I know how are Tranquilliser gun,pistol,two very similar assault rifles, a rare shotgun, hitting someone and zapping them with a repair tool, and that may sound like a lot but when you play it it is really not that much.

It has a great sub story, an interesting list of gadgets and abilities and the stealth missions are both frustratingly difficult at times and yet immensely entertaining. There is plenty of game here to keep you immersed for hours upon hours of gameplay between the missions, challenges and story mode.\nMy only complaint is the exceedingly annoying 'Load time\". Now this is to be expected during the gameplay between missions when moving from one level to another and we expect that. Where this game differs is when you have to repeat a level or a challenge that you failed to complete. Rather than start you up right away again, the menu takes you back and you have to wait another 30 seconds to a minute for it to \"Load\" the challenge once more. It's especially noticeable delay seems more pronounced during the stealth challenges where it is quite easy to fail a mission simply from being spotted. Having to wait repeatedly for the same scenario to load over and over again became increasingly annoying. Especially when you are just repeating the same scenario. I mean, honestly what is there to load?? You're just doing s replay.\nOther than that, once you've mastered the stealth challenges it becomes far less noticeable in the story mode.\nOverall an incredibly fun game. Definitely worth the purchase price even at $29.99, the only thing preventing the 5th star is the load time and having to repeatedly hear the nagging voice of the mission director when you have inevitably been spotted by the enemy.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 7:17 PM\n\nHi there, we're tremendously happy you're enjoying Espire and thanks for the great rating and review!

Thanks for playing :)", "Barrett463Jul 11 at 6:58 PM\nLots of fun, but glitchy\n\nThe game is awesome! Fun missions, different weapons, cool abilities, etc. What is really interesting, though, is the cheats. If you complete a challenge in a level, you unlock a cheat. Some of the challenges dont work though. In the first level, one of the challenge is to carry a golden espire model to the end of the letter. There is a platform you have to put it on. The game never realizes that you completed the objective, and never gives you the cheat. Same with the winklebottom objective. Same thing with the Jacobson drone destruction.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:33 PM\n\nHi there!

As someone who has loved Metal Gear Solid for many years, there were moments I forgot that this wasn't a MGS game. I came across very few bugs involving getting stuck, sometimes there would be a glitch when it came to completing an objective, and sometimes an audio glitch here or there.\n\n\nLonger version, as previously mentioned I've loved Metal Gear Solid for many years and while I did get excited when I first saw this game, I had my doubts and held off on getting it for a while due to bad reviews and being unsure of how the game would be overall. However the moment I went into the first mission, I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nGoing into this game the tutorial was a little slow for my pace however once I got my hands on a firearm and had to hide behind corners from guards, it felt like I was playing the original MGS1. The graphics are about on par with MGS2, The gameplay felt like it took abit from MGS5 when it came to time slowing down and hiding bodies, and the maps felt very much like MGS1.\n\nThe story kinda felt like it took alot from the original MGS1 on a bare bones level. \"Snake! A terrorist group has taken over the facility and taken out people hostage along with powerful weapons! Snake! Get in there!\" kinda thing which I honestly appreciate from the game despite feeling a little cheesy how close they are in comparison.\n\nI'm running out of character space but overall it was an amazing game with decent story, good art, and amazing gameplay.\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 1:33 AM\n\nHi! Wow! Such an amazingly positive review! Thank you so much for taking a chance on our title and we're super happy we delivered for you! :) Also love the fact you're comparing our game to metal gear!

The gameplay is awesome, love how you can go in stealthy or go guns blazing.\n\nThe main story (missions) took me about 6 hours to beat which includes the minium number of challenges you have to beat (to unlock missions).\n\nThere is plenty of replayability after the missions with all the challenges! The new weapon challenges are so fun. Plus you can replay missions to unlock cool cheats.\n\nI definitely recommend this game!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:28 PM\n\nHi there!

I am on my second playthrough (this time in hard mode) and I having a lot of fun.\nThe game really invites the players to repeat the missions multiple times with different playstyles. Mostly I go with the stealth approach, but is also very satisfying to go guns blazing through the levels.\n\nThe game has some bugs here and there.\nThe bugs which I encontered were mainly related to the mission trials and \"throphy\" system.\n\nSome trials do not register after completing them, p.e \"me and my luck charm\" from mission 1.1 seems not to register, independent of how many times I repeat it.\nSame happens with the throphies or acheivements on Oculus Scoreboards. I completed all the stealth challanges, but it seems not to sync with the game...\n\nAll in all, this is very good game. Which I highly recomend. The bugs can be annoying and become frustrating, specially for completionist players.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 24 at 12:29 AM\n\nHi there!

We do regret to tell you however the only way to unlock the cheats is to complete the side missions within the main campaign. We worked it so it was similar to the way goldeneye played on the N64 where you had to fulfill certain requirements to unlock them.

Thanks for the great review and rating and pleased you had fun playing! :) In regards to replayability we highly encourage you try out all the challenges and once completed them, attempting to optimise your rank on the global leaderboards in each one as that can present quite a challenge and definitely offers up some replayability. We highly recommend attempting the side missions (otherwise known as Espire trials) on each of the main campaign's missions. If you go to the mission select screen, on each mission page you'll see boxes on the bottom left, if you hover the controller beam over each one it will tell you what you need to do to complete each one. When you start tackling these and completing them it will enable you to unlock some ultra cool features and cheats you can use for fun during the game such as tiny espire, golden gun, invisible espire etc. :) We hope this advice presents you with a few new challenges to tackle in the game.

Nothing experience-ruining or gamebreaking, thankfully.\n\nSometimes when climbing high structures, you'll phase halfway through it even if you are not crouching.\n\nYou will accidentally load your weapon with ammo- wasting it- because your head was turned and your gun touched the belt even if your body was not rotating with your head. You may also accidentally load weapons while crouching.\n\nYou will have shots hit a target but not damage them, but that happens very infrequently.\n\nYou may load in without any weapons sometimes. You also may have your weapons all disappear by dropping one of them on the ground, including ammo.\n\nSome areas are so dark that even with the quests brightness at full I couldn't see parts of the map at all, and the game itself has no brightness settings.\n\nThe combat music is very repetitive, but this can be overlooked as it's something most combat games have.\n\nAside from these small issues, the game runs very well, is very fun and has a good plot, and I'd still recommend it to anyone with a Quest as it's one of the best paid games on the store.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 19 at 12:57 AM\n\nHi there!

There have been more than a couple that I KNOW I should've gotten and I didn't get credit for. Also, there are several that you have to play through the whole mission to know if you did it right or not. It is infuriating. Some sort of notification that lets you know if you have passed or failed the conditions for the cheat would help, and they have to fix the broken ones. It bothers me enough deduct a star.\nI would still recommend the game, and I think it is worth the price, but I do want to warn people that right now some of the cheats do not work even if you do exactly what you're supposed to.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 19 at 12:56 AM\n\nHi there!

It's an issue that is known to us and we hope to posibly fix this amongst a few other things in a potential patch in the future. Also in regards to stealth we can appreciate it can be a bit of a challenge especially in certain areas that are heavily guarded or where guards are well placed and it's essential in these circumstances to usually take advantage of most of your Espire unit's abilities. Always ensure you use Espire vision when you can for example to keep an eye on where guards are or possibly use your hand cams to mark them so you don't have to use Espire vision as much. Espire instinct (slow mo) ability also comes in handy especially when leaping off a roof or a ceiling etc as you can take out multiple guards as you're mid air which is not only awesome but efficient! :) We would also advise to take advantage of air ducts and climbing wherever possible.

The weapon mechanics are cool and it using your voice so you can tell people to freeze or put their hands up is really fun of you enable your mic. Overall the experience was fun and it was definately well worth the money.\n\nThey also have dope mechanics and they allow to complete levels in multiple ways so it doesnt often feel like you have to do something a specific way.

Ex.Episode 2 sneak attack every enemy in the mess hall without being detected. 9 enemies and 2 cameras. Even when you hide the bodies they detect you. Knock out time for enemies doesnt last long enough to sneak attack each foe. Which isnt explained how to do in any video on the net. When they wake up you are detected! Let alone sneak attacks dont always work, which is BS(throwing a gun at their head or tazing) Enemies can detect you even if you are out of sight even if you tag them!(if I cant see them, they cant see me) I was lying on the ground(in real time) under a table! Still seen. This is not the case even on normal mode or vr espire agent. Ep1. I took the golden espire model to the atrium desk at least 10 times and I still havent got the challenge. Difficulty means nothing in this game. Climbing glitches, sneak attacks are not guaranteed, and neither is the stealth factor. Hand Cameras are usefull though. At this point Im very fickle about this game. As much as I love failing to learn how to succeed its getting old and annoying. Please Devs work your magic\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 12:23 AM\n\nHi there! First and foremost thanks ever so much for taking the time to leave us a review and we're super happy you love the game for the most part. :) In terms of some of your complaints we'll try to advise you best we can. The challenges we set in our opinion, some are a lot easier than others that's for sure. The challenge regarding the sneak attack in the mess hall is challenging to an extent but definitely more than achievable. We would recommend you tag all the enemies before you do anything so you can keep an eye on where they all are. Just simply activate the camera with the trigger and hover it over each enemy to tag them and you should see markers appearing above them. Once you've done this there are a number of things you can do to achieve this. We would recommend however attempting to pick enemies off from the outside in. If you start in the centre of the hall you'll be exposed to a few enemies and it makes it a lot tougher to pass. We recommend starting with the enemies towards the right, make sure you utilise a lot of espire'a abilities such as dropping down on enemies, holding them up. Etc. Also those crates that are on the right can come in handy if you need to hide yourself or perhaps grab to pull up quickly to fire a tranq dart. We also recommend luring enemies out of places if you need to. Try throwing a magazine or throwing the camera to a place you want to lure a guard to and then take him out where it isn't so busy. All these little techniques as well as climbing can really help contribute to making passing it a lot easier. We hope this helps. :) In regards to the Espire doll challenge there was a small bug which came about as a result of our last update however we put a hotfix in a couple of weeks back and this should now fix the challenge so it registers when you've put the golden doll on the plinth at the end of the mission. If you've got any more queries or need any advice you want us to run you through feel free to chat to us on our discord server or send a message to our Facebook page and we'll be happy to help further. :) Thanks for playing Espire.", "NoobyDooby07Jul 26 at 7:17 AM\nMoney is a bit confusing in game\n\nThere isnt really a tutorial for the money aspect of the game but its still good\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response22 days ago\n\nHi there!

The general principle behind this however is to simply be as stealthy as possible, using as minimal abilities as possible and getting into as few confrontations as possible. Any weapons, abilities which are used or any guards that are killed or taken out ends up adding to the costs at the end of the mission or challenge. Time is also a factor so to be as stealthy, unconfrontational, and as quick as possible will really benefit the final bill and improve your rank on the leaderboards. We hope that helps. :) Thanks for playing!", "zaner010Jul 14 at 2:24 PM\nI love this game\n\nWhen I first bought this game it looked a little cheap but I continued playing it and it turned out really good I finish the whole game it gets a lot better the more you play it\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 27 at 12:20 AM\n\nHi there!

Once you're in the air grab the surface and then keep doing that and you should climb a lot faster! :) The compulsory challenges have been highlighted by a few people and we may possibly change that in the future. :) Thanks for the feedback once again and we hope the technique we advised about climbing and pulling yourself through the air helps. :) Thanks for playing!", "phoenix_wmJul 9 at 4:25 PM\n\nThis game was, and still is, very fun.

While the gameplay is really good and I enjoy it. Ive noticed a few things while playing and having to stop the game and resume later. If you continue a mission and youve left previously with weapons on your Espire unit, you return to the game with nothing except your repair tool. Providing a bit more of a challenge if you dont even have the tranq gun. Second is the non existent ability to jump, Im not sure if that only comes later in the game of if you have to grab on to something and throw yourself to jump. While you can get by in the game without jumping, seems to be a big thing when youre so used to playing other games on consoles the ability to jump becomes a natural instinct while running and gunning. Jumping is a key part in being mobile in any game. While the concept and design have been great, this little inability vastly affects gameplay making it a 3 star game, but 4 stars is given for design and ingenuity. A lot of work still to be done on the quest format of gaming, I still prefer the rift S due to a wider variety of games and better play. Thats due to operating off a PC which as we know may perform extremely well with a optimized refresh rate.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJun 3 at 5:21 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome rating and detailed review! :) We're glad you enjoy the title! In regards to the Espire unit starting out each mission with only the tranquiliser gun this can vary depending on the situation. If you start a mission controlling a new Espire unit for example such as in mission 1.2 then it's only natural the Espire unit doesn't have the guns your other Espire unit collected considering it's a different one. However if you possess a different Espire unit at one point you can go back to your old one and the guns will be on the floor next to it as it's deactivated. We also have a procurement system in the game whereby when you find a new gun in a mission you will be able to use them near starting points in most missions. For example say you find a machine gun in one mission you should see a machine gun hanging on a wall or something nearby when you start another mission. We hope that helps make it a little clearer. In regards to jumping we appreciate the suggestion and we'll take it on board. :) You can climb crates or ladders etc and drop down on enemies as a compromise for the time being which is super cool as it takes them out! :) Thanks for playing!", "DontCursePleaseJun 18 at 10:27 PM\nMy favorite game!

Thanks for leaving us an awesome rating. We couldn't implement blood into the quest version of the game due to graphical limitations.

We do recommend a number of things though such as sneaking up on enemies, knocking them out with a punch or by using your repair tool. You can also land on top of them and even shoot them at point blank once you hold them up. There is a wide variety of options you can pull off such as those to make the game feel more violent and the choice is up to you in that regard.

Love the idea of a vr stealth shooter. I also think that it is fun to choose if you are going completely stealth or just go crazy and shoot everyone. But there are a few bugs I want to report\n\nWhen I try to pick up a magazine from my belt or take it out of the gun manually it just disappears, I know I am being picky & that I can just swipe the gun near my belt, but it kind of ruins the feeling of being a agent sometimes. But it is a very small problem and this will be ok for the time being.\n\nAnother problem I come across is the AI of the soldiers. When I sneak up behind a soldier, the sound of me climbing will go through the mic and the soldier registers that as freeze and he freezes when I dont want him to. That sometimes will make him run away and scream for help, so it ruins the stealth. Also I want to say that when I knock out a soldier and puts him on the ground, he starts bugging out and flies through the walls. Sometimes he flies in front of another soldier and the other soldier tells the rest of the group.\n\nAnd sometimes the repair tool wont work, I try pressing the trigger, but the only thing that happens is that my controller vibrates and the rapair tool doesnt to anything. I find this specifically frustrating.\n\nI am sorry about the long review all about bugs. But I DO highly recommend this game because I think it is a good way to show off your vr headset. And I wasnt really sure about it either at the beginning because of the bugs people talked about, but I was so impressed by the story and how this game makes you forget that youre just standing in a room with a headset. The voice recognition is so cool, and I was a bit upset when they removed the open console voice recognition at the menu (please add it back again!) because it was so unique. And that you can go up to the soldiers and say freeze to make them freeze is just so cool. And that when you finish the story, you can go back to earlier missions to get better scores and badges. You can also do challenges to improve your shooting, stealth & climbing. And the new update that added new guns and challenges was very fun to play through.\n\nSo please fix these bugs & I would love it if you added back the open console at the menu when logging in.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 1:34 AM\n\nHi! Wow! We're truly thankful you love the game enough to brand it as the best you've bought! We truly appreciate that and we're immensely thankful for leaving such an awesome rating and detailed review. :) In terms of the bugs first of all we do apologise about that. The issue regarding the magazine is a known issue and you're not the only one who's reported it. We hope to fix it at some point in the future. The voice recognition is a new bug which we think came about as a result of our last update. It's frustrating to see that it doesn't function as well as it did before and we're aware of it as a team and again we hope to patch it at some point. There is a compromise for now where you could shoot the guns out the soldier's hand. Not ideal we know but it's something for now. We do have to say though the repair tool issue you're experiencing isn't actually a bug. It's an energy issue. If you use the repair tool, espire vision or espie instinct too much your energy guage will complete deplete and you have to wait for it to go back up again before you can use those abilities usually only for about 10 seconds or so. We did that to balance the game and not make it too easy so we would suggest just waiting for your energy guage to go back up again before using any abilities. With the exceptions of these bugs though again we're truly thankful for love the title and thanks for playing and enjoying Espire! :)", "Rowan516May 28 at 4:45 PM\nGreat game with cool mechanics\n\nI saw some reviews of this game and was skeptical, but I took the chance, and wow, did it pay off! It has tons of great mechanics and ideas. The \"missions\" feel fully fleshed out and everything. The cheats system is great, I unlocked the bottomless clips one and had and absolute blast redoing levels the run n gun style! The developers really care about this game and it gets updates very regularly and the updates always have tons of content. This update added a Intel collection mode that is cool, but the levels felt big enough to be longer than 5 minutes. The other mode is a \"shoot the target mode.\" It's fun, but I left each level feeling unsatisfied, I wanted to shot more stuff with the new guns. And 2 new guns. A super precise double shot SMG, and a hand held shotgun. The shotgun feels great to use and I would love to see it in the campaign. The SMG, however, feels slightly janky when you use it. (It's probably because it uses a new mechanic that I'm not used to)\nBut it still has some drawbacks.\n1. The enemies give up search of you after not seeing you for a minute, and although it makes sense so that if you get spotted you can re-enter stealth quickly, it doesn't make sense for them to give up so soon. The guards you knock out never get back up and report you. They are just out for the rest of the game.\n2. Sometimes (mission 3 in particular) the drop your zapper tool on the ground to lead you to the next objective function leads you to the wrong place. (this may have been patched, I haven't played mission 3 in a while)*\n3. This game is one of the biggest games on quest, but I feel like it is still missing one thing... Horde mode. I know this game is all about stealth, but the gun system is great! I wish that I could have a wall of enemies to blow away. The closest thing I have to this is a challenge that contains 11 enemies, and I have played that level more times than I can count. It never gets boring when you challenge yourself to do weird things, like only have slo-mo kills, or no guns.\nThings I loved\n1. Voice acting\n2. Healing system\n3. You can make guards surrender\n4. Mission 1.5\n5. Climbing system\n6. Tons of updates\n7.

Like others have said a few bugs here n there but vr is still a new thing and they hit the nail on the head with this one. I absolutely loved it so far. Great concept and great gameplay , I love being able to climb up all the differnt things and sneak past people. Multiplayer would be awesome too if able to put it in. Maybe like a PVP mode on smaller maps and there would be NPC ( enemies ) that would attack both players if spotted by them and the players objective would be to earn points. And players would be awarded points by taking out NPC's and killing the other player/players. And if you are killed by another player you lose some of youre points and those points go to the player who killed you. Then youd respawn of course , and all of this would be round based too , each round being 5 or 6 minutes long. And it would have 2 rounds , once the first round is done the players would switch spawn sides. And for the slow motion effect perhaps you could just take that out for the multiplayer , or you could have it to where its a ability/terminal that is placed on the map randomly and only one player can get it per a round and it would take like 10 seconds to ( download ) the ability.\nAnd you can call the game mode Surge , or overload or something.\nIdk just a thought I had thatd id share.

The magazines for the weapon you're holding should be on the left of your belt and all you have to do is grab them and place it in the weapon when your mag thats already in the gun is empty. We do appreciate and like your idea of putting a weapon behind your back though and we appreciate that having the weapon on your chest might be confusing and easy to forget that there isn't a weapon behind you especially when a lot of other shooters do that.

We apologise you found this frustrating and possibly this is something which could've been explained better prior to you jumping into a mission or challenge. What you're seeing is our Espire control theatre which is implemented to minimise motion sickness for players, particularly those who aren't too accustomed to or experienced with VR just yet. However there's a way to disable this, if you go into settings on the menu, or hit the left oculus controller menu button while in a game and go to the comfort options you should see a box that says Espire control theatre, just untick that box and hit apply and this then should disable it. We would also recommend going into display settings and disabling the HUD if you want an the ultimate field of view without the blue lines.

Is there something Im missing here? Bc it feels like it ends w/o closure to the storyline\n\nUpdate: thank you guys for responding. So, to clarify, the game doesn't so much crash as it does just abruptly end w/o closure to the storyline. It brings me back to the main screen instead of crashing and having to restart the game from my oculus library. As soon as you you catch up to the group of bad guy, entering the same elevator the big screen showed them enter earlier - the game just ends. No boss battle, no story resolution, nothing. Just brings you back to the main screen and suggests you try other challenges. I actually had problems installing the update. I had to u install & re-install the game a couple times before it updated successfully. Which meant having to restart the game, but even going thru it again, I have the same non-ending.

Now that thats out of the way, the review. I gave this game a 3/5 star rating because for $40 theres not a lot of content and yes I know theyre still updating the game. The story is great no flaws besides one, the ending its not that great. Spoiler alert, you complete about five tasks in one mission then you fight the boss, whos not that hard like the mission itself is harder than the boss. Then your frozen in place while the two big bads walk in and lecture you then hacks you Espire unit and then the screen goes red. You hit continue and thats it. Nothing else to do besides the challenges or replay the story. This game is super fun but for $40? In my opinion to add to this game would be to add some more story to the campaign or dlc. Add some Espire Unit or gun customization options where you can make your own unit and gun class. Or to go above and beyond add some online stuff where you could do missions with friends or random people. Now Im not a game developer or anything and this is just my opinion and I stand by it. This game is so good and has so much potential but for the lack of content and for the highest price available on the Oculus Quest, $40. Theres just not a lot to do.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 5 at 4:27 PM\n\nHi there! First and foremost we really appreciate you taking the time to leave such a highly detailed review and for rating us. In terms of some of the issues you experienced we apologise for those but we can advise. We know we left the ending a little fuzzy and on a bit of a cliffhanger however we do have big aspirations at some point in the future of hopefully developing a sequel which could potentially carry the story on. Nothing is set in stone but we're hopeful of making it happen. As you quite rightly point out there are challenges you can do however for even more added replayability we highly recommend attempting some of the side missions in the main campaign if you havent already tried them. This can bring more challenge to the game as well as added replayability and also once you complete these side missions you can unlock some super cool cheats/abilities which are fun to try out. On the campaign mission select screen if you look to the bottom left of each mission image you'll see small boxes and that's where you can find how to do each side mission. We hope that adds to your experience. :) In terms of the multiplayer request you're not the only one to suggest this however we can confirm that unfortunately multiplayer won't be coming to this game as the title is primarily coded and set up as a single player experience similar to how metal gear solid is. If we were to add multiplayer at this late stage it would mean reworking the game over again and it's high risk as it could make the game more unstable. If we were to ever add multiplayer it would be in an upcoming title in the future at some point should we be fortunate enough to make a sequel. We hope this clears things up a bit. We do apologise however if you feel you didn't get your money's worth out of it and hopefully we can make improvements in any upcoming updates which may release at some point.

In regards to the narrow field of view this was implemented to minimise the risk of motion sickness however you can completely deactivate this by turning the espire control theatre off by going into settings, comfort and then unchecking the espire control theatre option. If you're prone to slight motion sickness though it may pay to have the theatre on but on a smaller scale by just reducing it that way you still have the theatre but can see more of the game. Just as a tip if you want a complete full field of view you can also go into settings, display and turn the HUD off. Hope all this helps you to have an even better experience.

While I don't inherently dislike the game, it's hard for me to recommend it to someone without mentioning a few things.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Port runs smoothly (Appreciate the Quest port)\n- Visuals are nice\n- Shooting is solid\n- Climbing feels good\n- Generally fun to sneak around\n- Levels have multiple paths\n- Additional challenges are nice\n\nWhat I didn't Like:\n\n- Enemy AI is very stiff\n- Reload mechanic is too easy\n- Level design has a lot of back tracking\n- Checkpoint system is annoying\n- No significant challenge if you're seen\n- Menus and scoring screens have way too much info\n\nMain Feedback:\nImplementation of a \"load checkpoint\" option after completing large rooms would be nice. For a first time play through, it's a bit tedious to repeat the opening dialogue or walking/climbing part of a level each time you restart.\n\nFor harder difficulties. After being seen and reported once, or when a dead body is discovered (incentive to use darts), it would be a nice challenge if the guards didn't return to zero threat level, but maintained alert status.\n\nBiggest request that's probably the most difficult it implement would be a manual reload system and two handed grip for pistols. It just feels to me that it would add to the feeling of being tactical, and increasing tension to a shoot out.\n\nAs for something simpler. I find myself ignoring 90% of the end screen. I don't really know if my score was good, or bad. What I was being punished or rewarded for. Where these weapons are going. If I can use them or not. It's all a bit confusing.

This game has alot of weapons. Also, you dont have to use you ammo belt. You can take the magazine out from the gun. And tactically reload the gun which is great fun. The sound affects are AMAZING. And the loading times are great. This game is smooth loading. It loads like half life 1 and 2 (both parts). The first time it loads it takes a minute but after that it takes less then 5 seconds. Thats for challenges at least. For the campaign, it takes less than 2 seconds. This is a must buy game for all oculus players. This game is amazing.\n\nHelpful | 0", "insecurities6 days ago\nE\n\nYes but no\n\nHelpful | 0", "LemonNitrateJul 2 at 2:33 PM\nCouple small changes and its a 5 star\n\nLet me start out by saying this. I tried to refund this game, but I had already logged too much time into it so I figured I might as well write a review to maybe see if I could have some influence on the direction. During my time playing this game I LOVED the stealth aspect at first, then I realized you can pretty much just run into a situation guns blazing and the game hardly punishes you for it, also if you hide in a vent the enemies just NEVER notice you, which allows you to just peak out of the vent and shoot someone, then just duck back in without any consequences. I will admit that when I was gunning down enemies I did feel really cool, but thats not what I was wanting with the game. I feel no real reason to be stealthy when I can just gun them down and still have the same results. Main rant aside here is a list of what I personally want in the game (Note: I do not speak for the entire playerbase here, just myself.)\n\nHAND PRESENCE: With the hand cameras there is a lot of exploiting that you can do just by clipping your hand into a wall or door, this could be prevented by just not allowing the hands to go through objects (like how boneworks does it). Right now I can peak into rooms before the door is open just by pushing my hand through it and pulling the trigger.\n\nBETTER ALARMS: Whenever I do set off the enemies an alarm is sounded, which makes enemies more vigilant to their surroundings. Amazing! Actual punishment for not being sneaky....it lasts for like 3 minutes max and then goes back to normal like nothing has happened. If the alarms stayed for the duration of the mission it would clear up several of my problems with the game. And would definitely influence me to play it more\n\n(This one is really minor and doesnt really impact gameplay as it does immersion) An actual body/torso: I personally wish that I could look down and see my bodys torso and have arms connected to my hands, I get that it could be challenging to do so since different people have different arm lengths (speaking as someone with freakishly long arms here), and with crouching it could possess some issues with doing something like that. This hasnt really effected gameplay so much as it has immersion, but I wouldnt be upset if this wasnt added.\n\nBetter throwing: Ive noticed that throwing things such as the cameras is a bit finicky at times and makes putting a cam where you want it annoying (Maybe add an arc??)\n\nCONCLUSION: This game has so much potential to be better, with some pretty cool stealth mechanics, good voice acting, and weapon design, with some updates this game could easily be five stars. But with a stealth system that doesnt even punish you for being seen and allows you to just bust into anywhere and kill everything with little to no consequences. I cant bring myself to give this game higher than 2 stars for not delivering on its main advertising point. Devs, youre SO CLOSE to having a must buy on the quest.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:26 PM\n\nHi there! First of all we want to thank you immensely for taking the time to rate our game and leaving us a highly detailed review, a lot of time and thought has gone into it which you didn't have to sacrifice so thanks so much for that. :) In regards to your issues it can have a lot of varying factors. For example in regards to your issue about the lack of incentive for using stealth there are some users who can get quite overwhelmed by guards and there are also situations in the game where there isa higher guard presence than others which also have higher armoured guards especially towards the end of the main campaign. You sound like someone who is definitely accustomed to running and gunning and you more than likely find it easy to take out guards in the heat of the situation so perhaps it's better for your style to run and gun as opposed to utilising stealth but you'll find there are situations in the game where you would do your best to avoid confrontations and stealth would definitely be advisable. Also in regards to the same issue every challenge and mission has a global leaderboard and you're rewarded with a higher score and rank for costing the Australian government the least amount of money possible. Things that can save money include avoiding confrontations, avoiding using weapons, avoiding taking guards out and basically combining speed while being as stealthy as possible so there is some degree of incentive there to be stealthy if you're aiming for a good rank in the online leaderboards. We definitely advise checking those out as it might change your perception a little while also providing you with a challenge. :) We do thank you for pointing all this out to us though and we'll take it all on board. In regards to the issue regarding the climbing and hands going through surfaces you're not the only one to complain about this and again it's something we'll take on board and review, same goes with the torso. As for the throwing mechanic and understanding where the camera lands we appreciate it is a bit hit and miss and your suggestion is a really cool idea however it's something we more than likely won't be implementing in Espire. If we were to put something like this in it would be a future title which is something we hold big aspirations to do at some point. :) Thanks again for leaving us such a great and constructive review, we appreciate everything you said and we hope you can also understand our point of view for implementing things the way we did. :) Thanks for playing Espire.", "TailoredPants18Jul 9 at 10:01 PM\nGreat game\n\nAlthough it had a rough start, I can tell the game has been improved big time!!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 4:46 AM\n\nHi there!

I have always loved the stealth games but being able to do it in VR is fantastic. Overall a great game. All mechanics work how they are supposed too.\n\nThe reason for 4 stars is because I am the only one who can experience the game fully. What I mean by that is, when I go to Cast the game on to my TV, the voice commands do not seem to work while casting. So for whoever is watching is going to have to take your word for whatever you are doing in the game.

Though I do wish that the devs would add some sort of gun customisation, but only after you finish the story, they have so many different attachments and I would love to be able to customize guns, but if they won't do that, I would at least like a suppressor that could be added to Espires kit and could go on any weapon.

Thanks for leaving us a positive rating and review! In regards to the certification this is something we had to abide by for lawful reasons. Regardless of how someone may perceive this game or how infrequent certain content is this has to be done to cover ourselves. Hope you can understand. In regards to mission 1.4 this is the data centre mission. Your first objective is to take out all the copperhead laptops. At the very start of the mission you'll see two guards in front of you, take them out or find a way around them (choice is up to you) and you should see a laptop on one the nearby tables. Just simply shoot it or grab it and throw it to destroy it. If you then head downstairs either via the door underneath the camera or by the open elevator route you'll find a laptop there amongst all the guards and computers. Use Espire vision by putting your hand next to your head and hitting trigger if you're finding it hard to locate and you should see it. Deal with the guards as you wish, grab the laptop and destroy it. In the corner of that same room you'll then see a small spot you can drop down you can go here or alternatively there's an air vent near where one of the guards was standing. If you go through here or via the drop down route you'll enter another section and there should be two laptops here amongst a number of guards. We recommend explore the area, use Espire vision to locate the laptops and destroy them. That objective should then be complete. Once you've done this head back to the exact place you started the level (in the tunnel you were stood in at the start between both doors) you now need to go through the other door so effectively back where you came from in the previous mission. Once you do you'll see these guards that have stealth suits. Once they activate them you won't be able to see them unless you use Espire vision so carefully use that and take them out or avoid them. Once you're near the end of the caverns you'll see an Espire unit crate activate it and that's another objective complete. Use your repair tool and it should then lead you to the door where you need to go next go through it and you'll be back in the main hall from the previous mission. Go all the way downstairs (use your repair tool if you need to find the way) and head to the elevator a small narrative will then play about how copperhead have secured the elevator and that you'll need to override this to access the elevator. Use your repair tool to locate where you need to go next and it will lead you to the place where you need to override the security controls. You'll see a dark case on the desk open just simply put your hand over it and a 2 minute countdown will start. During this period some heavy armoured guards come to investigate, again you can take them out, hide or even use the tripmines which are on the table opposite. If you place these tripmines on a box or object and then activate them with your repair tool they become live so you could use them to trip the guards that come also. :) Once the 2 minute countdown has finished you then need to put your hand on the case again and this will complete the objective. You then need to head upstairs so look directly above where you are and just climb the metal frames for quick access to the above level. Use your repair tool on the floor and it will lead you to a door where the corporate offices are. You need to make your way through these and to the right you'll see an office through has a shotgun inside. This shotgun can be used as a weapon however it also has a magnetic strip on it which is used as a key to unlock the elevator from earlier on. So once you have the shotgun head back the way you came through the corporate offices and back to the main hall and go back down to where the elevator is. Equip the shotgun near the elevator and the elevator should open. Get inside and the mission is then complete. We really hope this all helps. :) Thanks for playing!", "ThePhoenix725May 21 at 10:07 AM\nBuggy, but great game, needs 7 things\n\nLet me begin by saying that this was the best VR game I have ever played. Graphics remind me of Half-Life 2, which I really liked. It needs a few things, though, some of which must be addressed. First of all, sometimes, when I take ammo from enemy weapons for my own, sometimes the ammo disappears and doesnt go into my ammo reserves. This must be fixed. Second, we need a way to take ammo out of shotguns other than shooting it off. I feel compelled to use all the shotgun ammo I can. Third, a jump button would be a godsend. Fourth, I have placed the golden espire doll on its pedestal on the desk and the gnome on its pedestal, but still have not gotten the achievements for doing so. Fifth, players need to be able to tell the soldiers to hand their guns over. Sixth is the problem of guns falling through the ground, which happens quite a bit. Last but not least, the bug of the free ammo. Sometimes I throw an empty gun away, and it teleports to right in front of my face and hovers there until I grab it, only to find its now full of ammo. Overall, it truly is a great game in need of a sequel.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 7:11 PM\n\nHi there! Wow! We're super humbled by the fact this is your favourite VR title! Thanks ever so much for the amazing rating and opinion! :) In regards to the issues you had the disappearing magazines is a known issue and a few others have reported this. We hope to fix this in a potential update in the future at some point. Your suggestion about the shotgun is also a great idea. Something we will take on board. :) in regards to jumping we don't have a jump button function for the Espire unit unfortunately however there is a work around where you can grab a metal surface and pull yourself up or away from something which will fling your unit through the air. We hope you try this out if you haven't already. :) In regards to the golden doll and gnome challenges this is unfortunately a bug that came about as a result of our latest 1.6 major update whereby the gnome or doll doesn't register when you place it on the plinth. A few others have also reported this and our team will hopefully get this fixed soon. Your idea about handing the guns over and saying other things is also great. We'll take that on board. We hope to fix as many things as we can in a potential future patch, we apologise you've had these issues but we're thankful you still love the title and had a blast playing! :) Many thanks!", "cmgeek2Jun 18 at 9:22 AM\nOne of the best.

I havent kept track all that much, but as soon as I was told it was out on Quest I bought it the same night. Espire 1: VR Operative is perfect in the fact that it is one of the few shooter games on Quest and honestly the only one of its kind. Choose whatever way you want to play this game, whether you are sneaking around corners with a silent pistol or barreling down hallways with an assault rifle. I personally enjoy climbing around and scouting the area before slowly knocking out the guards. Which brings me to my next point. I must agree with some in the community that climbing is kind of buggy and weird. Its fun, but I feel it would have been much better had we not had ghost hands and the walls been solid geometry. If my guns cant go through the walls then neither should my hands. Secondly, Im not sure where the AI field of view ends or how good their hearing is, but Im having severe trouble with the magazine throwing option that I was so excited about. Not only do enemies have strange detection issues where I could be in their line of sight and they cant see me from 20 feet away, but also I can throw as many magazines as I want but they are hearing them. Sure, it works once or twice in a good while, but not to the extent the trailer shows and I have found it to be quite unreliable at the moment. Thirdly, I just finished a level and was stunned to see that my bullets were bouncing off the enemies? I entered the slow motion bullet time feature (forgive me I forget what its called) and I could see sparks fly off the enemys head like he was made of metal! It made me very frustrated and forced me to retreat from an otherwise very easy fight. It wasnt even a heavy guard it was a standard early game guard. My last and most critical point: the hands. Im not sure if Im the only one with this issue, but it severely breaks immersion and shooting mechanics when my quest controller is clipping into where my hands should be. It seems like the model for the hands and the model for the virtual quest controller are fighting over what gets to stay on screen. This results in a flashy, buggy mesh of controller and robotic hand which make shooting extremely difficult and sometimes unenjoyable. Aside from that the game is absolutely tons of fun and I would recommend it. For fans of the stealth genre and shooter genre alike, this game is a gem on the VR platform. But, there are still a few things that many would like to see addressed and even more wish were implemented pre-release. Thank you devs for creating such a unique game and releasing it to the Quest platform though. We need more games like this for those who cant afford the big rigs!!!\n\nHelpful | 4\nDeveloper ResponseJun 2 at 12:33 AM\n\nHi there!

We're really humbled to hear that it was our game which influenced you to go out and buy the quest in the first place and we're happy we could deliver in most aspects of the game for you. In regards to some of the things which broke immersion we apologise for that and we're happy to take these suggestions on board.

Finally in regards to the quest controller vs hands issue it sounds like a real strange one as it's the first we've heard of this Is this something that happens in other games or just this one? Would be nice to determine what exactly that issue may be because it sounds like some kind of tracking issue.

This game will Open doors for others just like it. The game currently only has its first part of the story, but still has plenty of content to play through.

I really wanted to love this game, I mean I love the metal gear franchise, and it seemed super cool that you could play as this robot version of solid snake, and I have to admit, the graphics are pretty good after the update, but wht breaks the emerson is that your hands clip into walls and pipes when climbing, and the faces of enemys just look terrible. The physics are also off when you try to launch yourself off things that you cl8mb on and throwing objects. If you really like sneaking around in games and want to see what that feels like in VR, go for it. Other than that, its a pretty OK game, and there is at least some fun to have with it.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 17 at 12:16 AM\n\nHi!

Thanks for the rating and honest feedback. We're sorry you didn't feel there was too much variety with the exception of weapons however we may be able to advise on how to make the experience more versatile and enjoyable for you. Our main USP in this game is that it's a stealth action shooter and we've created the game with the intentions of providing the player with a lot of freedom and choice in each large scale environment about how to go through each situation. You can go in all guns blazing of be as stealthy as you wish or even a bit of both. We're unsure which method you tried however if you want to take advantage of the stealth a little more we can recommend perhaps moving through air ducts or climbing ceilings and walls. This can also act as a way of taking enemies out as you can drop down on an enemy and this will render them unconscious. You can also use the hand cams to mark enemies by hitting the trigger buttons with nothing armed and you can use the other hand to throw the camera, hit the audio button on the camera screen and this will make a sound to distract guards. Just a few tips to potentially help if you try again. Thanks for the feedback though, we appreciate it and thanks for playing. :)", "trimcargogamingJun 20 at 4:15 PM\nPlz make multiplayer pve and pvp\n\nThis game would be awesome with co op missions and online pvp battles\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 24 at 12:28 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome rating! :) Unfortunately however to cut a long story short multiplayer won't be possible in Espire 1 as the game is primarily a single played experience similarly to the way metal gear was also a single player franchise. The game was coded that way and if we were to introduce it now it would break the majority of the game and once all is said and done we may as well have produced a new title. We do have big ambitions to bring a sequel to Espire 1 in the future!

I dont like stealth games as much, i found out when i bought this game actually. But i know thats just my opinion because everyone and their mother loves this game. Of course that being said there are a few flaws even i noticed.\n\nWhen you get spotted theres barely a penalty, its like theres no difference apart from the hud's color. Maybe the ai's fov is higher but i never noticed, if there are differences you have to communicate the differences to the player. Not just say \"ah jeez now they're looking for you\", wasnt that what they were doing before?\nThis one might be my fault because i conserve the electricity bar for repairs, but theres no reason to use espire instinct or slow motion. Unless youre blasting youre way through enemies you dont need slow mo, and if you just pay attention you wouldnt need espire instinct. And even if you go out of youre way to use espire instinct the range is limited. so it gives you a false sense of security making you run right into a sight line.\nAlso the camera hands are bad. Thats pretty much the long and short of it, low resolution tiny window on youre non dominant eye (if youre a lefty its not a problem) and you cant see enemies because they blend in with the dark low res background. Maybe the low resolution is the quests fault for being weaker than pc, but that doesnt excuse the window being so small. If i die because the window blocks someone directly in front of me thats my fault, i chose to use the camera in a bad spot.\n\nWith all of that in mind what should concern you? Should you buy this game even after all those nitpicky things i said? If you've played a stealth game before and enjoyed it, then give this a spin. If youre a little unsure just keep the refund policy in mind.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 21 at 12:28 AM\n\nHi, we're really glad you enjoyed the game and thanks for the review! In regards to the AI a lot of adjustments have been made in terms of how the guards behave and we're always looking to improve that and every aspect of the game to deliver the best experience possible. The espire instinct is there purely to use in order to aid a wide range of players particularly if say for example their stealth skills aren't the best, the slowness in time can give them an advantage to escape a situation and it's a feature we've added purely to give the game some diversity and the player more options. The quest as a headset itself doesn't always do well in dark environments so we would say that's more of a hardware issue as opposed to a cam issue but we'll take your suggestions and review on board.

I dont mind the difficult ones, I just dont like ones that arent explained super well.

As well as the vision you have. Its sometimes frustrating while youre pressured. But otherwise this game is fun and addicting, really good 8/10 recommend!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 21 at 12:30 AM\n\nHi, we're really glad to hear you like the game and appreciating the concept behind it! In regards to the voice commands not always working it might be best to test the mic sensitivity for your voice commands in the game settings by going into settings, voice control and from there you can test out if your voice is best matched to low, medium and high. Please be aware your surroundings my also have an impact and play a part as to why it occasionally fails so feel free to give the mic sensitivity test a whirl and we hope it helps make the experience better for you. In regards to player vision there's a few options you can activate to increase field of view or decrease it. If you want a better view then go into settings, comfort and you can uncheck the espire control theatre which is intended to help with motion sickness. You can also deactivate the HUD by going into settings, display and turning that off. These two deactivations will help give you the fullest view you can achieve. We hope this advice helps and thanks for playing Espire. :)", "AlexBJUMay 23 at 11:51 AM\nGood game buttttt\n\nLike the game is good and all , pretty buggy and i finished the game, after finishing it i ofcourse uninstalled it.

Thanks for the rating and constructive review. Unfortunately our title doesn't support cloud saving. There isn't too many quest titles that do support this feature in all honesty and usually once you uninstall a game losing your progress is a risk you tend to take. However we do apologise that we dont have the cloud saving capacity. There are other programs you can use externally to back up quest games however so we would suggest perhaps looking into those as some advice as it will help you with any other title you play also should you decide to uninstall anything else.

Ontop of that the game is way to easy. I got back into the game because of 1.6 update and it said that there was a new mission, I went back in and it said I had to complete the last mission again, and basically in the very beginning of the level, I got soft locked, so I had to restart the mission. This has happened to me multiple times in earlier missions where I would actually go through the map. And to this day, I haven't died by the enemies once, and in go in guns blazing. I still didn't see the new mission, but the challenges are REALLY fun.\n\nBUGS I have encountered:\n\nI have glitched into the map on multiple occasions\nThe game has crashed multiple times for me.\nAnd the biggest bug I have encountered is the climbing. If you take the climbing REALLY slow it's good, but if you even try to go fast, you will encounter where it wont grab at all and this takes away from the experience ENTIRELY.\n\nCons:\nThe missions mode is way to short\nThe enemies are basically brain dead, like in metal gear.\nThe enemies dont respawn, so basically if you kill all the enemies (which is not too much) they dont come back.\nI have had minor glitches with shooting through fences or railings where it would hit an invisible wall.\n\nPros:\nThe challenges in this game are SO much FUN.\nThe layout of the levels are so good\nThe combat is good.\n\nIf they fixed alot of bugs and the climbing in this game it would be a 5 start game. But I wouldn't recommend this game, unless it's on sale.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMay 31 at 11:39 PM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the rating and highly detailed review! We apologise you've got mixed feelings about the title. In terms of the difficulty have you tried playing on the harder difficulty. There are two difficulty settings as you go into each stage and if you want more of a challenge we definitely recommend choosing that. In terms of hearing about a new mission in the recent update we implemented we apologise if you were under that impression but we haven't mentioned anywhere about releasing that. Our recent update included new challenge modes which consist of intel and weapons challenges as well as better lighting and visuals. We're sorry you were under the impression we were extending the campaign. In regards to going back into the game after some time away the game detects what mission you were in last but it is optional as to whether you want to continue it or not. It isn't something that's mandatory and that option should come up when you go to select a mission choosing whether you wish to continue the last mission you were on or not. In regards to falling through the map we apologise for that but we thank you for alerting us, is this something that happens in various points in the game or only in certain locations? Thanks for suggesting about how we can Improve the game and we hope we can make it better for you in our next update.

We apologise if you felt a little confused in regards to the settings. We've set out different settings menus to categorise the options you want to find but again sorry if this confused you. We can advise and confirm that our game does have snap and smooth turning and you can switch between the two. If you hit the menu button on the left oculus controller it will bring up all the various settings menus if you then click gameplay you'll see a turn type option at the bottom where you can select whether you want smooth or snap turning. We've also set the repair tool to automatically be on the player at all times because we want the player to be able to navigate around the environments freely, especially in regards to climbing and using the cameras on the wrist.

But I eventually bought when I saw it was on sale and all the updates the devs added. AND IT IS AMAZING! This game kinda reminds me of the Arkham series, b/c of its mixture of outright fight or stealth. Its so fun and has amazing replayibility with like twenty challenges you can along with the seemingly massive campaign, which actually has a decent story.\n\nFor everybody who tried this game when it first launch, but got a refund due to poor gameplay, graphics, glitches, etc. Come back and at least try it out again. You wont regret it.\n\nHelpful | 79", "Citadel17Apr 5 at 10:34 PM\nA Bit Janky, but Understandably So.\n\nEspire 1 is a fairly short stealth game developed for both the Oculus Quest and most PCVR headsets. It's definitely rough around the edges and has graphics that aren't exactly worth writing home about.\n\nDo you know what else Espire 1 is? A full stealth game that you can play on the Oculus Quest. Let me re-state that. This is a COMPLETE stealth game that has a campaign and extra side challenges coupled with mechanics that translate well into VR. ON THE OCULUS QUEST. Beat Saber had to have its graphics toned down, and somehow, Espire VR managed to port THIS THING on the quest.\n\nAs a game, Espire 1 is definitely a good experience. It's got mechanics that I found to be pretty engaging, and once you've got the hang of things, I bet you'll probably feel really cool sneaking around the game's base, as the mechanics are really fun to use (I.E. You can shoot a nearby wall to distract a guard, physically yell \"Hands up!\" when sneaking up behind him, he'll put his hands up, and then you can make a fist and deck him in the back of his head, knocking him out cold).\n\nThat being said, putting a game as engaging as this on the Quest comes at a cost, and that cost is certainly apparent in this title. The graphics leave a bit to be desired (I certainly wouldn't go from Red Matter to playing this), but that's understandable considering the port limitations. What's a little less excusable is that the game itself is just kinda janky. I've had my pistol fail to automatically return to its holster a few times, had my gun drop through the floor on occasion, have had ammo pick-ups not registering, the voice commands not working, being spotted through an airlock door a few times, had a guard not notice the shoot-out literally right next to him, I...could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture.\n\nAside from the jank, the only other complaint I have is that there should probably be an intermediate difficulty level. It feels like you get to choose between being made out of titanium with 3 lives per area and being made out of plywood with 1 life per area.\n\nBut if I'm being honest, I think that this'll be the most engaging stealth game, if not one of the most engaging games in general, that the quest will get in a while (Unless you can get through that stealth kyak game without laughing to death at the thought of a STEALTH KYAK). It's janky, but it's a complete game that I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMay 27 at 3:51 PM\n\nThank you so much for the incredibly detailed review and honest feedback! It was difficult getting the game on a mobile device but worth it when we see people are enjoying the experiance. We're delighted you're enjoying Espire as the stealth game we intended it to be. The various options on how to go about each situation along with the open environments were something we carefully considered when developing the game! In regards to the visuals we just announced a major free update last week, which among other things aims to improve the graphics. It also comes with a bunch of new challenges and modes like the weapon challenges, where you can try out new weapons and shoot targets for the highest score possible. Intel challanges are another new one, but with a focus on stealth. It involves sneaking around different environments collecting info and getting to the extraction point as soon as possible. As for the other issues you've experienced we're on it, and hoping to fix as many as pwe can with every update.

We've also implemented enhanced visuals and added new weapons along with weapon challenges whereby you use various weapons to hit targets and score the highest score possible in the shortest amount of time. We really hope this adds to the replayability and makes the game that little bit longer for you!

I have reviewed my rating to 5 stars because the devs, do listen and respond and Ive not really experienced that before, I think its just shows how committed these guys are to giving us all the best game out there.\nBUT PLEASE REMOVE THE COMPULSORY CHALLENGES, make them optional?, I do pretty good in the missions, just not so good when theres a clock ticking away in the background, its just not a pleasurable experience!\nBUT.\nOn a separate issue, I just want to thank the developers For taking the time and consideration for those of us who suffer from VR motion sickness. No other developers considered taking VR sickness seriously.\nBeing a novice to vr I have yet to Train my mind to totally eradicate vr sickness, Probably never would as I have tried every trick in the book and nothing completely gets rid of it.\nThe comfort mode options available on this game does (in my opinion ) not hinder the playability of this game and has made it possible for me to enjoy it And not suffer any serious dizziness or nausea (only just a little which is tolerable)\n\nIf only other developers out there would take into consideration motion sickness and incorporate the faint grids in their games so we can all enjoy the fast paced moving action games out there.\n\nWell done and thank you again to the developers for this really enjoyable game, (albeit the timed challenges !)\n\n\n\nSo far, me and my other half have enjoyed playing this game so much.

Sooner than later, you will have to forgo quiet tranq darts and kill people. I hate that in a stealth game. I also wish the save system was more forgiving. Although it reprograms you into an earlier save spot, the alerts are still on high and it feels like you have failed. When will VR just do quick save already? Especially for stealth games where you want to not kill everyone, but get from A to B. That said, the bullet time mechanics are great. They should license Max Payne for VR\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 7:07 PM\n\nHi! Thanks for the great rating and honest feedback! We're happy we were able to provide some great moments for you in the game. In terms of your comment about the true stealth paths we would say you can be as stealthy or as action packed as you wish. There are ways you can go about each situation completely stealthily however it can take a lot of practice and usually requires you to utilise everything Espire has at it's disposal. If you'd like more stealth we would definitely suggest utilising climbing on high surfaces and cliimbing across ceiling lights. Air vents are also plentiful in most levels across the game so keep an eye out for those as they can be very useful. The hand cameras are also a good technique to stay stealthy as you can mark your enemies using them so you'll always keep an eye on where they are. In case you weren't already aware you can also grab the camera that comes out your hand and throw it on a surface. Once you have hit the audio button on the camera screen and it makes a noise. It's perfect for distracting or luring guards away from certain situations. We hope all this advice helps and we do appreciate it gets more difficult see you progress to remain stealthy however the challenge is there and it is possible to accomplish. :) Thanks again for the review and thanks for playing Espire! :)", "Y0lo101May 10 at 8:23 AM\nGreat game !\n\nAmazing game with great controls and fun to play.

First and foremost we can only apologise it wasn't what you expected and it didn't excite you. We can advise on a few of the points you raised however. In regards to not knowing where to go during the game. During the initial part of the first mission you're provided with a repair tool which is multi functional so you can use it to repair yourself if you get shot, stun enemies and it also acts as wayfinder so if you drop it to the floor it will outline where your next objective is. In regards to the grid it's our Espire control theatre which we implemented to prevent motion sickness however this can be turned off by going into settings, comfort and unchecking the box which says Espire control theatre. This will provide you will a highly more immersive experience and one where you'll be able to see more clearly where you're going and what you're doing. Again we apologise it wasn't what you expected and if you feel we deserve another go based on our advice we would very much appreciate that.

The AI for the security in this game is awe full. I found myself tripping alarms just to have a fun battle (game intends you to be stealthy). Interacting with objects feels sloppy and unbreakable coffee mugs take away some side fun.

In regards to the replayability and length have you tried unlocking the cheats in each mission? There's also a brand new update we released last week which adds more challenges to existing categories as well as brand new intel challenges where you can collect info from briefcases while sneaking around as well as weapon challenges which involve new weapons and scoring points. We're also focussed on delivering a sequel at some point in the future. We hope you try the new update and thanks again for playing. :)", "jermenerm18 days ago\nEspire 1\n\nThis is a cool looking game and the sound effects are cool but whenever you move 90% of your screen turns grey and it makes it hard to see.

After playing for a good few hours I can say what many other have. It is really fun at times but can be to easy due to AI bugging out at times. It can also be a tad difficult to sneak around the enemies at times without being noticed.

The few reasons i gave it four stars is because it kept crashing, and because it would make me dizzy. I dont recommend this to beginners. The mechanics will make you a little dizzy. Overall its a great game thought.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response22 days ago\n\nHi there! Thanks for the awesome detailed review and positive rating! :) We're delighted you enjoy the game as well as all the aspects to it such as the variety in weapons and abilities at your disposal as you pointed out. :) In regards to the game crashing we're sorry to hear that. Something we can advise to possibly prevent this happening is to free up maybe a bit more storage on your quest. If your quest is nearing full capacity it may potentially cause this issue so we would recommend that to possibly prevent any crashes. If the problem still persists it may be best to uninstall and reinstall the game. We hope you're able to fix it anyway. In regards to the motion sickness we apologise if you did get a little dizzy. There's actually a comfort mode within the game we spent a while working on when developing the game designed to minimise motion sickness for VR players, especially newcomers. It's called the Espire control theatre. You can activate it by going into settings, comfort and checking the box where it says comfort mode, then hit apply. The view will end up being a little restricted as you're effectively moving around with a vignette on display but you can also downscale it if you wish a slightly clearer view as well as some degree of prevention in motion sickness. You can find the scaler also in comfort settings. If any of our advice helps we would love that additional 1 star if you feel we deserve it. :D We hope it does. Thanks for playing espire. :)", "Onyx_JPNJun 17 at 11:02 PM\nRepair tool wont work.\n\nIve got damage so I tried repair but it cant repair myself.\nAfter that I tried stun the enemy and start other droids but still wont work.\nNothing I can do to move on until start the new game and play all over again.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 22 at 12:44 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the review, we're sorry to hear this however we can possibly advise. The repair tool only works for a select amount of time. You'll notice an energy bar on the HUD and you'll notice it goes down once you start using it. It takes around 20 seconds or so for your energy to go back up and we've done it just to prevent the game from being too easy. It isn't just your repair tool which decreases you energy too. The abilities Espire uses such as Espire vision and Espire instinct also results in the energy bar decreasing. In terms of your issue we definitely advise just waiting for your energy bar to go back up and once it has the repair tool will be operational again. We hope this helps and we would love a revised review if it does. Thanks for playing Espire.", "logan.sanders.2776May 17 at 2:30 AM\nLoved it but it needs one thing\n\nI love the game but it just felt like it was missing something.

Thanks for playing Espire! :)", "SwanstreetMar 9 at 4:02 AM\nI quite like the game other then a flaws\n\nFirst off the gun play and movement is fun and fine. My problem put simply is theres so much immersion breaking small things like picking up a body and hitting it off lets say a table makes absolutely no sound or has any effect, shooting someone whos knocked out while pointless doesn't kill them, the whole teleportation when pulling yourself up really breaks immersion for me and it would be nice for an option to turn that off. Picking objects up is pointless and clunky such as brooms,cans, people. I saw several glitches in the enviroment, places where there arent even walls and you can see through the level, multiple pointless doors and corridors, and places you can climb to that lead no where. In summary i have an incredibly hard time immersing myself in the game to the point where I can barely play stealth its hard to ignore small details when it comes to vr.\n\n*Edit* upon a response from the devs and playing the game farther as you can get into the newer levels or challenges alot of my issues aren't as prominent as the levels design become much better and immersing yourself becomes easier and I can tell they've genuinely been trying to improve the small flaws there is so I'm raising my review to a 4.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 7:27 PM\n\nWe're eternally grateful for the revised review and we're glad the updates we provided made for a better experience for yourself!

Thanks ever so much for the great review and feedback! :) In regards to the obstruction when moving we can advise on how to disable that so you can have a full field of view when moving.

Just untick that, hit apply and you should be then presented with a full field of view. :) We hope that helps make the experience a lot better for you. You'll also see blue lines on the Espire helmet as you're looking out, you can also get rid of these if you so wish if you want an even clearer FOV by going into settings, display and deactivating the HUD.

Thanks for leaving us a great rating and review. We apologise if you feel the game lacks replayability for you however we can advise in case there's something you missed. Have you tried the challenge mode? There's quite a few various challenges you can tackle ranging from takedowns to climbing to hacking intel and the mode has a good amount of replayability as it can be quite fun and also challenging to keep trying to improve your score on the global leaderboard. To get a high score you need to be fast completing the level while being as stealthy as possible and not using weapons or taking any or as minimal guards out as possible. We definitely recommend that. There are also side missions you can attempt. These can be found on the main campaign mission screens and if you look towards the bottom left you'll see small boxes. If you hover your controller beam over each one you can see the requirements needed to pass each one. When you do complete them you can unlock some super cool abilities and cheats such as tiny Espire, golden gun, invisible Espire etc and you can have some fun with the cheats activated. We hope this helps give you a bit more of an insight into some of the replayability on offer.

We apologise deeply that the game hasn't been enjoyable for you. We can confirm in regards to the gold statue challenge as a result of our latest 1.6 update the challenge seems to have broke. The team are actively attempting to get a patch sorted for that bug as well as a few other general fixes in due course so stay tuned and again we apologise for that. In regards to the climbing that's something else that's been pointed out to us a few times now and we're taking it all on board and will hopefully improve this in time. Our latest update improved AI behaviour to make it more realistic but we appreciate there's still some work to do on it. Thanks for the feedback and again sorry the game hasn't worked out for you.

Thanks ever so much for leaving us a review and rating! :) We apologise you were a little put off by that. What you're seeing is our Espire control theatre and it was designed to minimise motion sickness for players who suffer from that, particularly VR newcomers. However you'll be extremely pleased to know that you can easily deactivate this for a full field of view. :) Simply go into the settings on the main menu (or hit the oculus menu button on the left controller if you're in the middle of a game) and from the settings menu go into comfort and where it says comfort mode just simply deactivate this by unticking the box and hitting apply. You will now have a full field of view whenever you play. :) Another thing we can recommend is if you want an even clearer field of view you can go into the display settings and deactivate the HUD if you wish to. :) This will also eliminate the blue lines on the espire head if you wish to get rid of those also. :) We sincerely hope this helps you have a far better experience and we would absolutlely love a revused rating and review if you feel we deserve it. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "OkayMysticMay 16 at 6:45 PM\nFun and possibly buggy\n\nLove the game but stopped playing because of bugs and now I'm hearing they fixed them so I'm hoping this is true!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 2 at 12:35 AM\n\nHi there!

Trying to jump the gap to the other side does not work and is frustrating because you cant get to the next mission....fix it!!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 21 at 3:58 PM\n\nHi, I imagine you're referring to the MARPISSA challenge. it takes practice to throw yourself over the gap. When you reach the other wall you have to put your hands on the wall and press the grip button again to 'grab' the wall! Try using \"Espire Instinct\" slo-motion ability (B-button). Press it when you throw yourself and when you get close to the wall on the other side of the gap. With time slowed down, it should be easier to 'Grab' the wall. Once you learn how to 'throw yourself' around the environment, the game can become a lot more interesting! Worst case, we put a fail-safe in that challenge. If you let yourself fall down that gap 10 times, it will teleport you to the other side.", "Stinko_modeMar 26 at 12:17 AM\nGreat game,could be improved\n\nThe game was overall great. The combat is good and the grips actually work. the climbing mostly worked great other then some troubles grabbing surfaces. stealth was great but it is a little too easy. My only other complaints are the story is short and doesnt have a great climax/ending, it needs more story missions and/or challenges,and it would also be nice to be able to change firing mode on guns, and manually reload. One last suggestion would be to add a co-op wave mode or co-op campaign missions\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 29 at 12:57 AM\n\nHi, thanks ever so much for the great rating and honest feedback! In regards to the difficulty have you tried unlocking some of the cheats within the main campaign of the game? Every mission has a number or cheats you can unlock and most of them certainly present a few challenges which can make it more interesting and gives you something more to aim for. Also we recommend perhaps when selecting a mission to play on the hardest difficulty. We're also fully focussed on delivering a sequel at some point in the future but for now we have added more replayability through our recent major update which consists of weapon challenges where you can shoot targets for the highest score on global leaderboards, intel challenges where you collect info from various points on the map and enhanced visuals. Just another small tip manual reloading is something you can already do. As opposed to swiping the gun near the belt just grab the magazine to your left on the belt and place it in the gun. :) We really hope all this advice helps you to enjoy the game further and we would love it if you could try out the new update and possibly add that final star which eludes us. Thanks for playing.", "BobbicornApr 16 at 10:36 AM\nPoor execution\n\nThe concept is brilliant and it all sounds brilliant in theory but in execution it falls short. The shooting is quite good, (even if you can get caught on the many items on your belt), but mechanics like climbing and the actual stealth are very clumsy. Security levels randomly go up and down with seemingly no rhyme or reason, guards can see you when you're way above them at some points, but not others. The tutorial does a very poor job at teaching you some mechanics (I never figured out what those cameras). And it goes without saying that the environments are dreadful, even by VR standards, and look even worse when you have to get close up to them. Overral, the game has plenty of potential and the developers have certainly proven their ability to act on feedback. I think the next step is to definitely overhaul the graphics, then tweak things like hands clipping through the environment, weird physics and so on. Maybe I'll buy it again then.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseMay 22 at 1:59 AM\n\nHi there! Thanks for the honest feedback regarding the game. We've been providing updates over the months which helps to improve the game aesthetically and mechanically overall and this past week we've just launched our biggest update yet. There are new challenges consisting of collecting intel and brand new weapon challenges which provides using new weapons to score highly on leaderboards by hitting targets. The update also includes enhanced visuals. We hope you try the game again and give us another chance to enjoy the experience and if I might suggest in terms of the enemies spotting you it may pay to use Espire vision from mission 2 onwards to scam the environment for enemies and act accordingly from that. Not only will it help provide you with a new way of going about each situation but it will prevent being caught as easily. In regards to the hand cameras they're used as a means to detect and mark guards without using Espire vision. If you activate them and zoom in on a guard it will provide a marker and the neat thing is you can also grab the camera with your hand and then as you zoom in hit the sound icon and it can act as a distraction for the guards so you can lure them. We appreciate the feedback however and will take everything on board.", "DoctorMcnuttyApr 28 at 10:04 AM\nHas potential. But it seems unfinished.\n\nThe ai are basic and I never really felt the need to hide, I'm a robot? Okay and I can heal? That means I'm invulnerable, I think it needs levels with a plurality of different ways to get to the objective, the challenges need work too for instance the challenge delivering the model unit to the stand, you can't finish it on account the model doesn't come with you during a loading screen to the atrium, it needs a patch. I'm willing to bug test but I need money for rent and groceries, but I'm also willing to give you all my loves as a hardcore gamer since the age of 9.\nI think I messed you company recently asking about discounts on this game, I think it should be, the dev lab needs more incentive.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 21 at 12:34 AM\n\nHi, thanks for the honest review. Not sure if you've had the chance to play through all 6 missions or not but you very much need to utilise as much as Espire's skill set as the game goes on as possible. Whether that would be utilising stealth, going in all guns blazing etc. The enemies within the game also gradually become more difficult. An example being enemies which can activate stealth camouflage which makes them invisible and you have to use Espire vision in order to see them. In regards to the healing sometimes there's occasions where you can't heal due to the pressure from the enemies around you which again can intensify as the game goes on. As far as the Espire doll goes it wasn't worded clearly beforehand but in our latest update we've made the description a lot clearer and emphasised it needs to be the golden doll that you have to bring with you and not just any Espire doll.

Also if you're looking for perhaps more replayability we strongly recommend attempting the side missions in each of the main campaign missions.

I'm regards to the visuals we are doing our best and have done our best to push the graphics as far as we possibly can within our means.

The voice commands are cool but there are some bugs that are quite annyoing like the shotgun bug where you can't reload or when you hold some thing with two hands and it disappears, but other than that the game is pretty much good. While there are some missing features like online co-op or multiplayer free for all and a feature that i would love to see is a team of maybe like 5 npcs and one player trying to wipe out a horde of enemies or maybe a team of 6 online players trying to wipe out a horde of enemies. I do know the game is not based around like killing waves of enemies or online co-op but all im saying is that it would be cool to see online or any thing maybe even shooting friends, but yeah over all its a good game allready the weapons are good, the npcs\nAre good and its fun to use voice commands against them, i like it how you can pick up certain objects like mugs.

Thanks for the awesome rating and review! :) There are a couple of bugs existing currently however we will attempt to rectify as many as possible in a potential future patch. We noticed you mentioned the cameras then and we would like to give you a few tips on how to get the most out of them considering it wasn't really explained too well in the game which we apologise for. There's a neat little trick you may not be aware of where if you activate one of the cameras keep the trigger held the entire time and grab the camera with your other hand. Throw the camera somewhere and when you move your head as you have the trigger pressed down you can utilise the view of the camera you threw. :) Also when you throw the camera if you keep the camera screen up and hit the audio button it will make a noise and this can be used to distract guards or lure them which is super cool. :) We hope you take advantage of those features! In regards to multiplayer, unfortunately that isn't something which will be arriving in espire 1 simply due to the fact this game was programmed for single player use and if we were to create multiplayer a LOT would have to be reprogrammed which would result in a few things within the game breaking. We do have aspirations however of a sequel which would be a dream and if we create one, multiplayer may be something we focus on. :) Thanks for playing! :)", "Captken2410Jun 9 at 4:53 AM\nKind of complex not really user friendly\n\nOk would help if we had a map or better user interface.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 14 at 5:02 PM\n\nHi thanks for the rating and review!

Thanks for leaving us a review and rating. :) We developed the game in mind to provide the players with as much choice as possible going into each mission whether that would be all guns blazing or acting stealthily or even a combo of both, it's entirely up to you. We can however advise that acting stealthily throughout the game will heighten you rank on our global leaderboards which you'll find at the end of each mission and challenge. If you act stealthily and progress through levels relatviey fast you complete levels in a shorter time and dont't rack up a huge expense by using guns, using abilities and killing guards. This will result in a good ranking and gives you that incentive to act stealthily. We would also highly encourage you attempt the challenge modes which provide a lot of replayability as well as attempting side missions. Side missions can be found on the mission select screen on the bottom left of each mission picture. If you hover the controller over the boxes it will give you the requirements to pass it and as a result of passing you can unlock some super cool features and cheats to use for fun.

I was wrong and at the time the AI was really in constant and the graphics were horrible. But you devs really made the game a lot more fun with this new patch and I appreciate it a lot. There still is some minor flaws like for me the hand to hand combat is little bit janky and I tend to lose some stealth missions from it. I would accidentally hit the guy in the chest and he doesnt react. Also sometimes I feel like I lose a stealth mission or I get spotted even tho it didnt feel remotely close. Again this problems happens to me a lot and I feel like many other people have encountered the hand to hand combat the same way. Not only that but a cool way to make the game more realistic and cool\nis to add a melee weapon and grabbing physics when a person is alive. Again that is just my opinion and you really dont have to listen to me or anyone else at all devs but just know if your reading this I respect your hustle and creativity. You really stepped up. Thank you and I will continue to play your game. Yours truly -QuanWick\n\nHelpful | 12", "jaquony_boiJun 21 at 8:16 PM\nGreat gameplay and very fun, but\n\nI would give this game 4.8 stars if I could, here is why.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun and keeps your headset on for hours at a time, the maps feel well plotted out to both go loud and stealthy, the movable body/hide the body mechanic makes the game extremely more realistic as well as the voice command, saying freeze makes you feel so cool, I still cant get over how well it is done, the wide weaponry makes the game feel a lot more open as opposed to a all stealth game for more options, the repair tool feels very satisfying to stun a enemy or sentry with complete stealth. the game gives a sort of super hot vibe to it so there is a purpose to have a headset on your head, to make it feel more realistic. I put it on my top 3 list of games on VR\n\nHowever, I have experienced glitches that costed me a mission reset, the repair tool didnt work to power up a beta espire unit, and a chunk of the map was missing in a mission where you have to hack something for about 2 minutes in order to gain access to something, thanks to the repair tool I was able to navigate around the area but its still kind of annoying even though it didnt entirely break the game, the graphics are on the top end of the oculus quest overall, but the standard enemies with the ski masks on their face look kinda unrealistic, or low poly to say the least.\n\nOverall the game looks great, feels great, plays great, and you can get very into it and play a lot without the game already being done at that point so I would recommend it to all oculus quest users, new and old\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJun 24 at 12:30 AM\n\nHi there! Wow! Thanks for the extremely detailed and well written review! :) We're super happy you appreciate our game for the most part and it's especially pleasing to hear you talk about all the things we implemented intentionally to provide the player with such as the choice between stealth and action and the wide range of weaponry at your disposal. :) We really appreciate you categorising us as one of your top 3 titles as well! In regards to some of the issues you faced, first and foremost we apologise for that. The chunk of the map you experienced as missing for example seems to have broken slightly and came about after our last update. We're aware of the issue and we will hopefully fix this in a potential future patch at some point. In regards to the repair tool issue you'll notice you have an energy bar an your repair tool as well as Espire's abilities are unusable when your energy bar is empty. We advise waiting for your energy bar to fill back up before you try using the repair tool for activating Espire units or repairing yourself and that goes for Espire vision and Espire instinct too (slow motion) we hope this helps you out a little. :) Finally in regards to the visuals we're extremely restricted to what we can do with the quest due to its limited hardware hence why the faces don't always look perfect.

I have to say the game is a bit overpriced and when running in the game there is a annoying filter where you can only see part of the screen. The game is very satisfying and does a pretty good job at storytelling.

First and foremost we thoroughly appreciate the positive review and rating you left us! :) Secondly we can definitely advise on all the issues you mentioned on your review. In regards to the filter you mention that's our Espire control theatre and it's designed to reduce motion sickness for VR players, particularly newcomers or players who are still finding their feet within virtual reality. However you can deactivate this in the settings and have a full field of view which I'm sure will definitely improve your experience. :) To deactivate it either go into settings on the main menu before you enter a mission, or if you're already in a game hit the menu button on the oculus left controller. Go into settings, comfort, and untick the comfort mode (Espire control theatre) and hit apply. This will deactivate the control theatre and you should now have a full field of view. You may still see some blue lines which are on the Espire unit's head. If you want to deactivate these as well you can go into settings, display, and deactivate the HUD. This will also deactivate those so you will have a 100% full FOV when playing. We really hope this helps. :) In regards to general bugs you mentioned, we have updated the game a good few times since you kindly left us your review and we've managed to scrap a few bugs along the way and improve visuals, lighting, dark effects as well as implementing some new content on the challenges mode. We hope you give the game another try again soon if you haven't already and hope our advice helps.

Other than that, great game!\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMay 31 at 11:26 PM\n\nThanks for the awesome review and rating and we're very happy you're enjoying the game! In regards to ammo sometimes it's best to conserve it for when you may need it the most and to take out guards by falling on top of them, stunning them with the repair tool, or by holding them up and punching them to take them out! (Don't forget to hide the evidence :D) However there are magazines to pick up on top of boxes, warehouse crates, desks etc so we would encourage you to look around all the nooks and crannies to see if you can find any. :) You can also collect ammo from guards once they've been taken out however these are mostly for machine guns.

First and foremost we're delighted you enjoy the game! Sadly however multiplayer won't be something we'll be implementing into Espire 1. The game is coded and set up to reflect a single player expedience and to cut a long story short if we manipulated this to allow multiplayer features it would result in a lot of bugs occurring and things wouldn't work anywhere near as well.

But very satisfied hope they bring new challenges to the game , doesnt feel very sneaky , they should add more hiding places but very good the aim is very realistic I guess. Ive never held a gun ever but very good. they should do it more like hit man so it would be hit man vr. And day time outside not just inside and futuristic and you should have a target that you have to kill or an a online mode . Maybe their is I havent checked it . Very satisfied!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:42 PM\n\nHi there! Thanks ever so much for the awesome review and rating! :) We appreciate the constructive criticism too and will take it on board however we can advise on a few things you mentioned. In regards to using the repair tool/wayfinder you can in fact re calibrate your belt and where your repair tool is on your body if you feel a little uncomfortable as to where it currently is. If you hit the menu button on the left oculus controller mid game you should see a re calibrate setting and you can recalibrate where your belt and repair tool sits on your body. This was something that was introduced in a recent update so we hope this helps. :) In regards to new challenges our recent 1.6 update was the biggest yet. We've added brand new challenges including weapon challenges that make use of new firearms to shoot your way through the levels by hitting targets and trying to get the highest score on the global leaderboard. There's also intel challenges whereby you can navigate your way across various new maps we've introduced requiring you to hack workstations and gather intelligence before escaping. We hope you get a chance to enjoy those if you haven't already. :) In regards to hiding places we give the player in the game the freedom to go about a situation or a mission as they please. That could be stealth or all guns blazing. In regards to stealth however there's a few things we can advise on to make the stealth aspect feel more beneficial. You can utilise Espire vision by putting your trigger to your head and pulling it. This will enable you to see throwing objects and surfaces and you can stalk enemies or take note of where they are. You have the ability to climb so you can scale across high surfaces and there are also air ducts you can enter which can lead to perhaps an ambush on enemies or bypassing them completely. Those are just some of the features available. We hope all this helps and thanks very much for playing. :)", "RowdyRocketMar 7 at 7:45 PM\nVery cool! I'm loving it.\n\nBeen wishing I had a game like Budget Cuts for the Quest. This on is even better than I had hoped for. I enjoy playing stealth. Sneaking around, dropping down from the rafters to take out the enemy, timing it right so the others aren't aware, then dragging the body so it's not detected by the others is a rush. Very enjoyable!

Many thanks for leaving us a review and rating! We're delighted you love the game for the most part! In regards to the dialog at the beginning you can choose to \"skip briefing\" when a mission starts by hitting the menu button on the left oculus controller and selecting skip briefing. This then puts you directly into the start of a mission without having to listening to any dialog. Unfortunately however there isn't an option to skip the dialog in the first mission when you're collecting the tranq gun, holster etc but as reiterated you can skip the very beginning part by pressing skip briefing.

Thanks for the great rating and review! We've updated the game a lot since you kindly left us your feedback. There are new challenges consisting of intel and weapons challenges whereby you shoot targets and hack intelligence from various workstations across a wide variety of maps. We can confirm these challenges in particular prove quite challenging and contain a large number of guards in each level. We recommend giving those a try if you haven't already. :) We can also confirm to you that the game in terms of the main campaign does indeed become a lot more challenging with heavier armoured guards and an increase in numbers the further you go through the story. We definitely recommend trying to go through the game a little further and you'll notice a vast difference. :) There's also a fair amount of replayability in the game. You can attempt the Espire trials if you end up completing the main campaign. They can be found on the mission select screen in small boxes towards the bottom left. If you hover your controller over them it will tell you what you need to do in each mission to pass the trial. Once you complete the trials you unlock cheats and added features that makes the game just that little more fun. :) There's also the challenge mode as we previously stated as well as attempting to improve your scores on each mission and challenge. We also have scattered many hidden guns for you to locate across the main campaign which can add to the replayability again and you can find a lot of hidden secretive places when attempting this. :) We hope all this advice helps make your experience even more enjoyable. Thanks for playing Espire! :)", "datcoolguy9917Jul 4 at 9:53 AM\nAmazing\n\nThe stealth is well implemented and is extremely realistic and reminds me of hiding and scaring someone oddly, it DEFINITELY does not look the best on quest but other than that its great\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:24 PM\n\nHi there!

It crashes all the time, the climbing collision is terrible and the heavy shotgun guys can see you through walls and the back of their head! The hand camera thing is hard to use because of the resolution, but that might be better on a better headset. Also it also basic ps3 graphics. Aside from that, it's pretty fun.

In terms of the resolution for the camera you may find it a lot better to use now as we've just recently launched a major update that includes enhanced visuals within the game and the camera from my own experience definitely seems clearer. It's worth noting that due to the limited constraints of the quest hardware there's only so far we can go with visual enhancements to make it the best game it can possibly be visually and to keep it stable. In terms of the crashing that's quite an unusual issue and not something I've seen too often. Can you let us know if this is still happening?

Combat has been the standout challenge set for me, where I've clocked up hours and hours attacking the maps in new and different ways and slaying the hoards of (surprisingly) intelligent and heavily armed guards.

Sometimes the game doesn't know what's going on and kicks me into a pause menu, it's even crashed on me. Even with the issues at their most glaring, this game is always a good time and I have yet to experience anything TOO game-breaking.\n\nIf you're getting into VR games, especially shooters, this is a really good step to take before getting something like Boneworks (assuming you have a computer that can run it). It's comfortable and the only time the game bugs out is when I try to explore corners of the map with nothing in them.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseMar 9 at 4:03 AM\n\nWe're glad you're having a good time with the game but sorry you're experiencing issues! We're always working on the game, trying to fix any bugs while we add content. Regarding 'kicking into the pause menu', it's possible that the pause button is being pressed accidentally right in the middle of gameplay, or the headset \"proxmity sensor\" is being triggered (taking off the headset pauses the game, the proximity sensor is what we use to detect this). We can add an optional small (1 second) delay to the game when pressing pause, it should remove this issue.", "Ronin9Mar 29 at 8:35 AM\nLeft wondering.... Why.\n\nIve never left a review before so I figured this was a good time to start. 3 was generous because to be honest Im a little late to the VR game but what do I know. Ill try to keep it short but who knows....\n\nI have found that these developers are really good at having a image make there game look a lot better than it actually is. I am 30 years old and have played games since the Sega Genesis days. Then naturally a ps1 then a ps2 and then a ps3 a ps4, along with an Xbox, multiple Xbox 360s still while playing on friends N64. PS4. My point is I have been staring at video games for over half my life.\n\n\nPoint being I was just a tad bit disappointed. The beginning feels epic. Very Arcady feeling, kinda like sirento but its own thing, less like robo recall..\n\nSome games quest games can make me sick for an hour and some dont affect me at all. This one got me a little dizzy. Which is really where my issue was.\n\nThe first mission is to climb out of the room your in . It was extremely glitchy just trying to climb the wall 3-5 minutes into the game. I have The Climb and maybe because the graphics are solely for that It was noticeable to me,but it stuck out.\n\nYou essentially have three robots you get sent out on with 3 lives before you get sent back to the home base. Naturally I was on my third life and started where I had the first two times and the entire ceiling had gone black, things were lagged out and blatantly just not there. Well, Im disbelief I climbed the wall anyway that I new was there but wasnt rendering and not shown and continued to walk around like I was glitching out around the boundaries like when someone cheats. A lot of the other graphics really were a disappointment as well. Your hands go right through everything it got me pretty dizzy.... Theres different types of missions. Theres a horde type match that I was pumped for and when the bad guys turned the corner they looked like bumbling blocks which was kind of laughable...\n\nIt really just seems like a lot of the quest games are marketed for kids eh 12-14 with titles that are attractive to adults. I personally got the quest for gravity sketch and wireless 3D modeling and then once the link was released it was a no brainer.\n\n\nIn conclusion I feel like the video game industry is going backwards. And what people are willing to pay for seems to be on the lower end budget of things. Yet they are priced at a higher value than what it actually is. It just sucks to see how everything has become proprietary in purpose and reasoning. Facebook owns oculus, all Facebook cares about is data and money. So we the consumers infinitely get the short end of the stick...\n\nOk cool, what so this is a young developing team thats getting to exploit there game that they didnt have enough money to make so they can charge more than what its worth so they can just complain to someone like me that its a lot of work ? Well you guys are also getting the short end of the stick as well by putting out games that cost oculus basically nothing to put out while you help them make a profit whilst putting out a sub par game.....\n\nIt stuck out to me that the creator of oculus says the graphics on a quest are equivalent to that of the first XBOX, that came out what 15 years ago.... He has since stepped down because of how pathetic he thought his own creation was...\n\n\n\nSo if you want to feel like your playing an Xbox game from 15 years ago, that gives you the spins and and has graphics that sometimes work, this is the game for you.\n\nCharge $10 hey even $12... Cool.\n\nYou guys charge like $30 for a game thats supposed to exceed or it-least meet expectations and you most certainly have not..... people over profit !\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJun 9 at 7:18 PM\n\nHi, we appreciate the honest feedback and detailed review you left us. In terms of graphics which we noted as one of the issues you had it may have been possible you saw trailers for this game which belonged to the rift/steam PC version which can naturally hold and process better visuals in our game. We have however worked extremely hard in making the quest version the best game it can possibly be and we will continue to do so through the updates we keep releasing. In regards to the dizziness we're sorry you experienced this while playing. Just a tip but have you tried activating the Espire control theatre in the settings? This system is designed specifically for players who suffer from motion sickness to move around in comfortably to avoid motion sickness. If you don't like the obstructive view you can always balance it out by adjusting the sensitivity of it in the comfort settings. We really hope this helps you overcome that. We also recently released an update which includes new challenges and enhanced visuals.

This will disable the restrictive view for you entirely. :) You will still see blue lines from the Espire head on your view however you can also turn these off by going into display settings and turning off the HUD.

Assuming you're new to VR as a whole we would definitely advise taking regular breaks, drink water, rest up etc and gradually you may start getting used to it a litte more. We also advise using something we implemented into the game to decrease the feeling of motion sickness and that's our Espire control theatre. It impairs the view a little however it can definitely help with motion sickness. You can also scale it so you don't get it too full on and so you can get a good balance between view and feeling less motion sickness. If you go into settings, comfort and tick the Espire control theatre box it should enable for you and you can also adjust it as I say to suit your balance between reduced sickness and view. We hope this helps and we hope your motion sickness inproves as a result of our tips. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "Scouter407Jul 22 at 7:54 AM\nAmazing game\n\nThis is such an amazing game, and I have experienced zero bugs so far\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response22 days ago\n\nHi there!

The gameplay is very good but there's not alot of stealth.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 27 at 4:08 PM\n\nHi there! First and foremost thank you for the amazing rating, it's very much appreciated. :) In regards to the visuals these are something that's continually been improved as we've released updates but it's worth noting that there's only so far we can go with optimising them to the best of our ability considering the quest's hardware. We can happily say though in our recent major update we've improved the visuals a considerable amount and also introduced brand new challenges including intel and weapon challenges. In regards to your comment about the stealth it all depends on how you play and how you utilise Espire. For example you can hold the triggers on either controller to tag an enemy to keep an eye on where they are. You can also grab the camera throw it and in the small camera window hit the sound icon and that can distract the guard to lure them to your area. You can also take advantage of climbing surfaces such as walls and ceilings to avoid guards or even prepare a sneak attack. We also recommend trying out creeping up behind a guard and saying freeze to a guard. It's a very cool feature. :) We hope this advice helps make the stealth experience better for you!

Why go stealth when they wake from your tranquilizer and alert the gaff?\nShould have poison darts or be able to tie and gag the soldiers.\nAs it stands it's better to go in guns blazing which sort of defeats the point.\nThe game itself is made with love.

Thank you for the amazing rating and awesome review! :) We're delighted you enjoy the game for the most part! In regards to the machine gun issue it's a strange one admittedly and one we haven't come across. Does this happen frequently or was it just one one occasion? We also apologise that you felt nauseous. The Espire control theatre we implemented is designed to minimise motion sickness however there's no guarantee it will completely prevent it. We can only advise possibly playing in short bursts and working your way up from there. We hope that helps. Also in regards to the repair tool we set it so it guides the player to the next objective, sorry it doesn't appear long enough to your liking, again we can advise you to possibly throw the tool down on the floor again after the first time of doing it to give you an idea where to go. We can also say sometimes it's good to not always follow the tool exactly but to go alternative routes, through vents for example and to explore the environment a little more. :) It can provide the chance to procure new weapons and find stealthier ways which is something we had in mind when making the title. :) We hope all this helps you to enjoy the game a little more. Also take care not to play too much in one sitting and we hope you can gradually work your way up to a comfortable feeling. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "mattskii360Feb 23 at 9:31 AM\nReally fun\n\nThese games are getting so much better for vr, especially inexpensive vr on oculus quest.

While you're in the air if you also use Espire instinct (slow mo) you can control where you can travel to and change direction as you're doing it which is a neat little secret tip there for you to enjoy and it's useful in getting to some hard to get to areas quickly, not to mention improving score and rank on the leaderboards for speed.

A 4 star rating experience for Espire 1 with 1683 reviews as of writing this post. I read upon the reviews just to see what the game was like, I remember back when the game first came out, how buggy people said it was. I had wondered if I waited some time (7months later) then buy it, would I have a different experience. Today you'll will find out.\n\nI thought most of the reviews were probably old and outdated, but I was so wrong, because even after the many updates there is still bugs that completely ruin the game experience. I'm only about 2 missions in which isn't very far and I like to play seated, however when I take off my headset for any reason to go to the restroom or get something to eat and then put the headset back on, it tells me to return to my seat and won't allow me to move, but I can still get shot and die which is crazy. I stand up and sit back down but it makes no difference. I have to abort the mission and restart which is incredibly annoying everytime I remove my headset.\n\nAnother really annoying bug is when I go to recalibrate. My waist is completely fine however no matter what I do I can't recalibrate my chest without it being invalid. I have to button mash the grip button just to get past it but it doesn't recalibrate it. Even whilst standing it gives me the same issues\n\nAlso at times I'm able to climb a wall then if I slip or fall. My hand sometimes go through the wall and I'm unable to grip the wall anymore.\n\nAnother minor issue when I pick up bodies it tells me to return back to my seat if I bend down too much which totally takes you out the experience. I have to then move about on my seat just to get back on with the game. This is so incredibly annoying.\n\nI have went through walls, fell through the map, I'm only 2 missions in and yet there's so many bugs! The game has the potential to be fun however these bugs just make the experience not worth your time. If you haven't bought the game yet. I recommend you don't. Not until they address these bugs. It's 7 months in and it's still buggy as hell. I don't believe this game will change much now.

In terms of some of the issues and bugs you're experiencing we apologise about this however we'll be more than happy to advise. In terms of the climbing it's something that's been reported by multiple users and it's something hopefully we can maybe improve on in an upcoming update, we do apologise about that. In terms of falling through the map it's something that seems to come about as a result of the last update we installed which again we deeply apologise about and hopefully we can fix this at some point. In terms of the seats issues you're having we have to be honest and say this is an unusual issue and not one we've come across before. Are you sitting in the exact same place you were originally in before you got up? We're only asking as it may have something to do with that. If it does it again we could recommend perhaps holding down the oculus menu button on the right controller to recentre yourself in the game and see if that makes a difference. We hope this can help and again we're deeply sorry about some of the issues you've experienced. We will work on trying to improve the game more.

One, the complete amount of bugs and glitches and outright crashes that happen, on the final mission, I could not go 5 minutes without crashing, finding a new glitch, or having the game pause from bugs. It also has a stealth goal, but the stealth mechanics need refining. It's too hard to complete things stealth. In the first level you set your utility belt and chest holster how you want, but you cant change it after. So every level I end up having my cover blown because I keep grabbing my gun instead of the body, or I accidentally pull out an SMG from my chest and start shooting instead of making a fist. Not to mention that the hold up mechanic sometimes requires multiple attempts to get it. I think that the bugs mainly happen because i'm on quest, one of the only 2 platforms you can get this and the Snapdragon 835 cant handle the huge environments and all the AI systems.

I love the premise of Espire 1 but the execution (for Quest at least) is downright frustrating. Heres a list of initial problems:\n\n Controller visibility bug where the touch controllers somehow merge over your hands after interacting with some objects\n\n Massive difference in quality between textures for objects and various environments (Red Matter has set the visual standard for UE4)\n\n Environmental objects straight up failing to load visibly into scenes, but are still collision enabled (railings, doors, the floor, etc.)\n\n Traversal is downright painful at times getting caught on the smallest of objects or ledges (a jump button would be a godsend, or a mechanic similar to jumping in Climbey)\n\n Zero custom grab hand animations for dynamic objects and climbable surfaces, as well as zero visual feedback for grabable surfaces, meaning youll be grabbing everything you can see wondering if you can lift yourself or not\n\n While I appreciate the spacial audio, there is ONE audio sound that plays for every object collision. Cups, bottles, hats, poles, enemy bodies, weapons, you name it. No matter what surface you throw it at, same sound response. Yikes.\n\n There are no decals left on textures when you fire a weapon. No bulletholes, no glass damage. Its small, but its expected in 2019.\n\n A huge drop in quality in level design after the first mission. General items become more sparse and you are left with half empty copy-paste rooms with randomly-placed janky enemies.\n\nWhich leads me to the worst offender...the enemy AI.\nMy previous points would actually be tolerable if the AI wasnt riddled with issues.\n\n Their detection fields are ridiculously sensitive; hiding in shadows is pointless, their field of view is too big to hide effectively above them and you are INSTANTLY detected if you are in their fov for even a millisecond. (The Dishonoured series would be a great example of playable AI that still maintains its difficulty)\n\n Due to the physics based nature of the game, if an enemy collides with an object (happened multiple times during my playthrough), they are knocked out. This was at first convenient and hilarious...until another guard that was right next to him raised the alarm completely ruining my stealthiness. Shame.\n\n Enemy animations are reduced when peering around corners using your hand-cam making them literally float around instead of walk. This only seems to happen when the enemies are out of the players line of sight and Im assuming has something to do with occlusion culling.\n\n Enemies teleport a couple feet back after playing their final player-detection animation, before engaging in combat. So if you shoot while in slow-mo right before they begin to engage in combat...*boop* you missed...because game.\n\n There is no feedback for how much sound youre making. The default walk sound doesnt change volume depending on your speed and its never defined what volume or proximity will be picked up by the ai.\n\nI cant speak for the other platforms, but on the Quest its feels like a rushed port of a game in beta. I think with some extra heavy attention it could be one of the best games available. Ive never done anything cooler in VR than walk up behind an armed guard and say freeze before stealing his gun from him and bonking him on the head with it.\n\nBrilliant. I just wish the rest of the game could match.\n\nI hate to criticise such creative people that have clearly put a lot of time and love into this project, but its such a shame to see it fall so short. If these issues can be patched, itll be an instant rebuy. Until then its a pass from me.\n\n\nEDIT: If anyone wants to comment bugs or issues that theyd like to add, Ill add it to the post for feedback if the devs happen to peruse.\n\nu/obi6kenobi25m\n\n I keep having a problem where when im next to a wall i cant draw my gun because i just grab the wall instead of the gun. This is frustrating and means i get shot.\n\n When timeslow is introduced, it doesnt even tell you what button to press (if it did i missed it).\n\nu/CaprisWisher\n\n Reloading sometimes gets \"stuck\" and I can't reload even though the stored ammo count >0\n\n There is an audio button next to the zoom button on the hand camera interface, but it is unclear how to use it and the touch zone is so small that it is really hard to press.\n\n MOST IMPORTANT - this game needs even more Australian accents mate!\n\nu/xXblackmustardXx\n\n There is also a major bug 30-40 minutes in the game. When you're supposed to unlock your new espire robot (The one with thermal vision) they tell you to open the Wrist console that looks like an iphone on your wrist. My hand model doesn't even have a wrist and there is no button to push. What you have to do is say \"Open Console\" and you will progress but the game doesn't even tell you that.\n\nHelpful | 986\nDeveloper ResponseDec 25 at 11:21 PM\n\nG'day and thanks for the review!

A lot of the negative comments are complaining about the reduced HUD while moving, however this can be turned off completely regardless of what you read in these comments.

A sequel to this game would be a dream for us and we hope to make that a reality at possibly some stage in the future so stay tuned for that. In regards to replayability our latest 1.6 update has added extras challenges including weapons and intel as you may have already noticed so we are adding things and trying to improve the game all the time. :) In regards to the suppressed pistols these exist in many locations within the game already. Two notable locations that come to mind is in mission 1.2 before you head out into the mess hall when you deactivate the lasers you should see some hanging up and also on mission 1.4 at the very beginning of the level you should see one to the left and there's also some hanging up besides the wall near the security cameras. They are in many other spots too across the game so we recommend keeping an eye out for them. :) We hope this helps and thanks for playing Espire!", "TrueInsomnikMar 12 at 3:29 PM\nThis is awesome!\n\nI just want more content!

We've also introduced intel challenges that involve sneaking around and collecting info at different points so we hope you check these out. :) Also just as a tip please ensure you're in a relatively quiet environment when using the mic otherwise it may not pick up your voice. It's also worth noting you can change the mic sensitivity in the game settings whereby you can test out the mic to see how accurate it is at picking up your voice.

As soon as it was available for pre-order on PSVR, I was on board. Then the delays...and delays... When it finally launched the PSVR version was completely broken, and I heard there were issues with the Quest version as well. However, having faith in the devs and the game, I waited to play. Then a few weeks went by and people we're reporting the game was (mostly) fixed. So that's when I had my first taste of Espire 1 and it was great! So much fun climbing on walls, holding enemies up and taking their guns, everything was just....fun. However, I still had a few annoyances here and there. But those were mainly due to the limitations of the PSVR's tracking and Move controllers. Since getting my Quest, I've tried to avoid re-buying games. But I knew Espire was one I had to try without wires and superior tracking. I am so glad I did! This is by far my favorite experience on the Quest. Everything just...works. It's an immensely fun and immersive experience. And even if you play through the story, every level is worth a replay. As are the challenge maps. Great game. Great dev team.

Enough for it to be my most anticipated game of the year!! Followed the amazing journey through to its release today and I KNOW from what Ive seen on YouTube streams, news articles, footage, gameplay already etc how good this game is to justify giving it 5 stars. Been following this like a lunatic for months and always been a fan of stealth action espionage and this game delivers every metal gear fans dream from the past!\n\nEDIT after playing the first mission:\n\nWOW OH WOW OH WOW!!! Its EVERYTHING I imagined and more!!! Theres no words to describe how ingenious this game is!! The stealth options are limitless, every situation gives you a choice, you can knock enemies out, take out cameras, kill enemies, put them to sleep, drag their bodies, land on top of them it has it all!! This is THE quest game changer and Ill confirm that right now!! Even at the end of a mission it works out how much time you took and how much money youve cost the Australian government and the idea is to get through each level as fast and as undetected as possible while avoiding using weapons. Every bullet, weapon, guard you kill costs and the more you kill and waste weapons the lower your global ranking is. Its INGENIOUS and to boot the game seems LONG and challenging with a great story! These developers have been careful, toom their time and made this game a VR masterpiece! Dont even think about buying this! Just DO IT because you wont regret it!\n\nP.S anybody whos prepared to give a negative or mixed review JUST because of the restrictive viewing when moving, please DONT!! You can turn this off in the in game settings by Disabling the theatre mode before you play.

It's as if metal gear solid was in VR. There's so many amazing features and paths I've yet to experience in VR. That being said, the visuals in this game are very sub par.

I want to applaud the developers for this quest build. It looks great. And it runs smooth too. Clever use of baked lighting and dynamic lights makes this game really pop on the quest. I watched some yt gameplay but the real Deal was something else. Also big shout out to the HUD in the vizor its soo well placed i love it. You really feel like your inside a robot just like in Lone Echo.\n\nThe gameplay is really cool aswell, you got guns, assault rifles and tranquilizer gun for taking down enemies. You can also melee attack, if you're sneaky like me :) This is also the first game ive played utilizing the mic on the quest for a couple og things like \"freeze\" or \"hands up\". Climbing is a big part of navigating alternate routes in the game. And the mechanics works great. You can also hide dead enemies to prevent other guards to see them which is a cool touch. If it only had online play though, i know thats not just a buttonpress but this would be a great game for CO-OP missions! :D I would not hesitate getting this game.

Sounds like the developers have responded well to updates as well, so this game could be really polished in not long from now. The controls are smooth.

We also implemented intel challenges whereby you sneak around a bunch of new environments hacking workstations in various areas and collecting intelligence before escaping.

Based on the content I have played so far, I can tell you that this should be a 4.6 - 4.7 star game. Its extremely fun, awesome, and complete metal gear solid. It isnt groundbreaking like beatsaber and super hot, but is massively underrated and should get more love for the price your paying. This game is in abundance for content. One of my original concerns for a high definition, large map, and vast mechanics were the content. And they did one heck of a job. There are 7 lengthy and unique missions that often take anywhere from 45mins - 2hrs, per mission as well as challenges and situations. On some missions I was lost in the huge map and needed to retry to keep me on course, the repair tool can act as a waypoint, however sometimes it doesnt work which leads me to my number one issue. Bugs. Even after the patch, there are still noticeable bugs and glitches. It doesnt affect the gameplay much, but can be often annoying. Other wise than that, this game is definitely worth the 30 dollar price tag.

At first, the limited field of view annoyed me - but I disabled the comfort settings and now I can see all around - all the time. Does not make me motion sick - you can completely customize as you go. The reasons for less than 5 stars..\n\n1. Limited instruction. What is HOLD UP, how to properly reload a weapon... i've had to look up Youtube videos to learn these things.\n\n2. You can only play a part of Mission 1... them you have to pass a bunch of skill tests called challenges. You cannot proceed further until you pass these... no way to skip them. They are so hard, it's not FUN. My reason for gaming is FUN not frustration. So, I end up playing the first parts of mission 1 over and over. I guess it's still worth the $$... just with I would access the rest of it.\n\n3. There is a big cheat menu where none of the boxes are checkable. Maybe you have to pass a skill test for that as well. Really don't know as there is no instruction on why you can't check the boxes.\n\nStill fun, but it just for the Mission 1 (part 1) experience.\n\nRevised 1/26/2020 to 5 stars as the stealth objective requirement was lifted.

First the AI can be a little wack when you are engaging aggressively and not stealthily and I have had some AI freeze in place.

It was good though. Better than many other VR games out there. Could be improved on grabbing the gun, it being comfortable or not. Even with the utility belt set in a good position, it doesnt always allow you to grab stuff, especially in intense situations. Also , the climbing could be improved because sometimes you just fall without even releasing the grip trigger. All in all, it was quite good, but if all those flaws would be fixed, then the game would definitely be worth its price.

Thanks for the honest feedback! In our last major update we actually dramatically reduced the loading times from several seconds to around 2-3 seconds. The visuals are also something we can only do so much with on the quest due to its limited hardware capabilities however we have been pushing the boundaries of it consistently throughout all the updates we've implemented. In terms of the two blue lines we can advise on that, if you go into settings and then display you can switch the HUD off and this will disable the blue lines you see on the Espire head. Also while stealth may be one of the main premises of our title it's actually a stealth action shooter and we made it so it would reflect just that by allowing players the choice of going through each situation. You can be as action or as stealth orientated as you wish to be. We do advise on stealth though to get the most out of the experience as you can fully utilise all of Espire's abilities and it can help you achieve a higher global ranking on each mission or challenge leaderboard. If you go in all guns blazing and kill everybody this can cost a lot of money and your ranking won't be as high as if you were stealthy. In saying all this however we do apologise you didn't enjoy it as much as you wanted to, we'll take on board what you said.

Thanks for providing us with a great review and rating! :) In regards to the bugs and issues you're experiencing we can hopefully advise you on these. We've updated the game a lot since launch and we appreciate it's been a while since you left us this review so it may pay to go back into the game and see if you're experiencing the same number of bugs. If the repair tool still isn't functioning as it should as a way finder we would advise perhaps using it every 30 seconds or so from the start so you definitely don't lose track of where you are. Usually the tool in game can get a bit of confused if you skip an objective or something. It's something that we still need to review at our end. In regards to your issue with the shotgun. There are different armoured guards in the game. The ones with the light plain looking armour are usually pretty defenceless and can be killed off rather easily however if you did the same to a heavily armoured guard it will take a bit more force and more effort to kill them. We assume the guard you were shooting was heavily armoured which is why you would need to shoot them a few more times.

As with any grand vision, and pushing limited hardware to the brink there were a few bumps, but the team behind this game has done an AMAZING job with updates and enhancements to keep refining and making something that will be worth coming back to for years to come.\nI do hope they consider adding some paid DLC with some of these updates since as a software developer myself I know this process can be expensive and Id hate to see them dry out the coffers before their vision is complete. Its clear you guys have many ideas and things you want to see through on this, please allow us consumers a better chance to help you with that. I for one would be more than happy to pay to continue the updates coming.\nKeep up the good work, and for those one the fence about the purchase - just do it, you wont be disappointed!\n\nHelpful | 1", "leitner.stephanJan 26 at 4:45 AM\nWorth every penny\n\nThis game is not perfect. But it is by far the best ecperience on the Quest you can get today.\nThe immersion is good (including motion sickness after an hour or so). You can freely move around including some climbing, stairs, hiding behind boxes etc.\nWhile most other games provide comic-teletubbies like graphics, in this one you don't feel like in a fairy-tale, almost realistic textures and convincing atmosphere. A must-buy.\nSure, there are some flaws. I don't really get the underlaying story, while the speaker gives you some hints in english, german text appears on the screen, and all that when you're distracted by a new environment. I wish I could read somewhere what the mission I was just given was.\nSome stuff can be grabbed, even large stuff like desks, bins and bodies while some things like cups seem nailed on the desk.\nSomtimes stuff is just hanging around in the air.\nSometimes the story is a bit boring when you have to run around just to pull a handle, at times you run forth and back not knowing what to accomplish next because the repair-tool fails to draw a path, but I haven't got stuck so far.\nBut all in all, it provides a wonderful experience running around in different offices, caves and halls avoiding and neutralizing patrols by different means.\nA strong recommendation for those who like the old Wolfensteingames.\n\nHelpful | 0", "7panda7Jun 9 at 3:14 PM\nFeel like batman, with guns.\n\nThis is the best spy-ish, high tech, intense battling, stealthiest game on the oculus quest.

Its not perfect, the enemies do get a little wonky sometimes, but its so much better than it apparently was at release.

First and foremost thanks for taking the time to leave us a review, we appreciate that. We do sincerely apologise you got extremely nauseous from playing. We can advise on a couple of things which may prevent it should you wish to play the game again at some point. We have an Espire control theatre which we designed when we made the game which restricts the view but helps navigate the player around the environment with reduced motion sickness. We're not sure if you're playing the game with that on already however if not you can enable this by going into settings. To do this, hit the left controller oculus menu button mid mission and go into settings, comfort settings and tick the comfort mode (Espire control theatre) box and hit apply. This will restrict your view a little but will help with motion sickness. We can also advise you to take breaks as much as you can with the hopes you'll get more used to the motion. We hope this helps if you decide to try our game again.

Now the pressure is on and its crunch time. Hype only growing as the months passed with only a few trailers for players to consume. Expectations grew wild and release proved to be rough but the devs persevered and have been making the necessary fixes needed to get this game back on track! There surely arent many games that attempt to blend climbing elements reminiscent of The Climb, shooting elements similar to Pavlov/Sairento and its own original take on stealth. AI has been an issue but after patch 1.4 one can choose between multiple playstyles/routes to proceed from area to area with some realistic stealth. The story is fairly lacking but its to be expected as VR is still in its early stages and these are small teams of VR pioneers. Its an excuse to get us into the action and provide some sense of life, which works out decently to be fair. I do wish to have more missions available in the future but the challenges have proved to be a very fun mode aside from the story. There is definitely much replay value to be had with the challenges and I can only hope to see more as it does add quite a bit of depth. One thing I could see improving the gameplay is a patch that allows players to grab and pull enemies off of ledges when they may be hanging beneath them. Thank you for the wonderful game guys! This is the only game I havent refunded on my Quest because its delivering on what it set out to do. Patches will only continue to improve this ambitious title. People have to realize its probably difficult to create stealth in VR that is realistic but fun at the same time, and this game delivers on aspects we havent seen many other games attempt.\n\nHelpful | 4", "kkuzma1982Dec 20 at 2:37 AM\nBest game on Quest after patch 1.4!\n\nDefinitely best game on Quest after patch 1.4 and still a lot more to come as developers promised to add new content and are also working on light and shadow system.

I would highly recommend trying this game\n\nHelpful | 4", "yeetboytothemax678Jan 23 at 6:52 AM\nReally good game\n\nThis is the first game I got for oculus quest it really is amazing but there were some bugs and errors other wise this game is great just needs improvement. I would also like if there was a multiplayer that would be cool. Best game I've played so far\n\nHelpful | 1", "masteralexblueDec 29 at 2:20 AM\nHas a few bugs but is overall a blast!\n\nSo first I'll get the cons out of the way that affect me the most, then I'll move onto why I really enjoy this game:\n\n1. Grabbing ammunition off my chest works half the time as sometimes itll work and other times itll collect the magazine as if it were ammo to be collected from a table. This essentially sucks in situations where I need the ammo!\n\nAlso the space between the clip and the repair tool should be a bit further apart... I find myself grabbing the repair tool instead of the clip soooooo much during combat. When things are fast paced it needs to be easily accessible and not needing to be fumbled through for the right thing.\n\nAs a final side note on this topic, I wish there was an eject mag button or I had to take out the empty mag before inserting a new one. Shoving another mag in the gun with another mag still in it breaks immersion for me immediately. Like why even have to manually reload?\n\n2. Why cant I jump?? This would make so many things in this game easier!\n\nIf jumping is not possible, I'd like to say there should be a gesture of sorts to show you're done climbing. (I was thinking both the players hands should be pointed to the floor then release grab as that makes the current feature work more often than not.)\n\nThis is because the auto climb thing that happens when you're close to an edge works about 50 percent of the time. Other times it does it for me when I dont want it to. Sometimes I peek over an edge or want to shoot over an edge and then boom! I'm standing I'm the middle of the line of fire for no reason...\n\n3. Instructions, instructions, instructions... please guide me better. I was clueless numerous times on what to do. Now I know how to play through experimentation but please. A guide of sorts would do wonders!\n\nSpeaking of guides, why cant we just have a map? Itd help so much with knowing where to go. The tool thing works, but it doesnt feel right to me. If a map isnt possible, I can live with what is here but PLEASE if you take anything from this review... PLEASE just make the doors that are inaccessible already with red handles so I dont go up to every... single.. door... wondering if theres something in there. I'd prefer if it was marked to save me the hassle of looking around.i play rpg's a lot and this is habit for gamers that loot.\n\n\nPROS:\n\nOnto the great stuff! This game is amazing. What I mentioned first has not deterred me from playing! It's a blast. The challenges are actually fun! That's hard to accomplish. I love the soundtrack, it makes me feel pumped and the amount of freedom to approach obstacles is insane! You can go quiet or guns a blazin. It doesnt matter and it's great!\n\nThe fact that I can go prone in reality and crawl under a table, shoot a guy and pull him under with me to hide his body is epic!!!! Also, jumping down from hanging off a ledge in slow mo while gunning down an enemy feels like a blast!\n\nI dont regret this purchase at all. I see the dev's are working hard at making it better and I wanted to contribute with this review. I've seen a lot of complaints about the AI in reviews but they dont bother me much. They arent waaaaay out of wack. They do see me sometimes when I dont think they should be able to but hey... more reason to use that cool assault rifle I just found a few minutes ago lol!\n\nI say, if you enjoy the game for what it is now, later when patches come out itll be even better and more forgiving. The dev's will iron it out and I have faith in this game! I hope this review is helpful and I've said something that helps a buyer or a dev.\n\nThank you!\n\nWritten on Dec. 29, 2019\n\nHelpful | 4", "jashot7Dec 15 at 8:19 PM\nThe Best Full Game on Quest\n\nI hesitated for quite some time to get this due to the price and reviews stating its issues. Ive been craving meaty, full first person immersive experiences. I own or have refunded every experience and I consider myself very picky about giving something 5 stars.\n\nThere are issues with this game, but nothing even close to keeping it from being incredible. There are more game mechanics, more depth and more replay ability here than I expected based on the other reviewers. Finally another full game! After beating Arizona Sunshine 3 times, I am so pleased to be spending time with Espire. At this point right now, after a few hours playing and lots of time experiencing all of the core mechanics along with playing around the the myriad settings for comfort - I firmly promise you this is worth trying at least. For me, this is probably the best game Ive played on quest.

The \"James Bond baddie base\" aesthetic is a little spartan but well done and the devs have done a great job producing a Quest version which is surprisingly similar to the Rift one graphically (to the extent that I'll probably be mostly playing on Quest for the wireless freedom).\n\nThere are loads of \"comfort\" options for those who haven't got their VR legs yet, but thankfully most of them can be turned off. However, the devs have made the bizarre decision to segment your view into three panels which is really annoying, like being forced to watch a movie spread across three monitors instead of a single large screen. Worse, the two side panels regularly darken to produce an even more annoying blinkered effect (which still occurs even with the \"comfort\" options set to disabled).\n\nIn addition, the virtual bezels lag slightly behind your head movements, giving lateral turns of your head an uncomfortable wobbly effect as if you're looking through a pair of glasses mounted on springs. Hopefully the devs patch in the ability to eliminate the bezels and blinkers entirely ASAP.\n\nWhilst we're on the negatives, controller relative movement seems to be bugged. I immediately enabled it, but movement was still head relative until mission 1.2 when it started to work properly.\n\nAnyway, with all that moaning out of the way, is the game itself any good? Thankfully, yes. Graphics and sound are solid, with good animation and voice acting. Most importantly, the gameplay is fantastic, providing top notch stealth action combined with a range of fun gadgets and abilities (like remote cameras, zip lines, body stashing and voice interactions) which provide lots of options for how you approach each level. I can't comment yet on length, but there are various challenges & leaderboards which should expand replayability. The virtual stock is also the best implementation I've ever seen!\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper ResponseDec 21 at 2:41 AM\n\nSo glad to hear you've been enjoying it so far! We wanted to leave a quick note: We've pushed our 1.4 patch and tried to address all the issues you've reported. We've also improved the graphics on Quest. The game is not looking anywhere as good as the PC version but we hope you'll notice the improvements! We're continuing to work hard and add more features, content and fixes to the game. Thanks again!", "BGPabloDec 20 at 12:50 PM\nHuge smile factor! :)\n\nSo you want a VR game that will suck you into a new world. And you've been looking for a Quest game that is more than just an arcade experience. That was me and Espire has provided both wonderfully. It is an ambitious game -in other words, it seems like they had to make some concessions to make this work on the Quest, but what they've managed to put together has put a huge smile on my face over and over again.\nIndeed, I have come across some glitches, but the sense of sneaking around as a a spy piloting a powerful machine is fantastic!. Knocking out a guard and dragging their body into hiding never gets old, as does telling them to freeze (causing them to surrender). Using a guard's weapon against them is hilarious fun. Reloading weapons by replacing the magazine or actually pumping the shotgun feels so gooood. I like how there's often more than one path to take to encourage being sneaky. Climbing around feels so amazing.\nI appreciate that playing the campaign unlocks arcade-like scenarios, where you are challenged to complete fast, or by low cost (or a combination of both).\nI do have a couple gripes, but I stand by the game deserving 5 while stars :)\n1. Some of the times and scores of the top ten in the leaderboards scream of hacks. Can you investigate this?\n2. In some air ducts, I was able to stand and see a glitched-out view of the level.\n3. Not to copy Metal Gear to much, but I wish I could make a sound (like taking a wall) to distract/lure a guard.\n4. I wish I could skip some of the dialogue for replaying levels.\n\nSo many people are talking about Boneworks, and I feel like this deserves the same level of attention.\nKudos to these developers!!\n\nHelpful | 12\nDeveloper ResponseDec 20 at 10:41 PM\n\nWe really appreciate you leaving such a positive review, it helps us so much.

Spent the first hour getting used to things and kind of enjoying the experience so far. However, there are a few things holding it back. The movement will take a while longer to get in tune with but that goes for many games. My biggest issue is with the overly intrusive obscuring of the peripheral field of view and the style in which it achieves it, when moving. Other games do this but not to such an extent [UPDATE: Yes, you can edit this and following the dev response, I've finally worked out how to turn it off]. In addition, the grab mechanic and magnetic holstering seem a little off, not good when you find yourself in an unexpected shootout. I was also disappointed by the way you grab through things, instead of around them. After a couple more hours of play I'm really not digging it. Perhaps I need to learn how to play but the AI seems even dumber than I am. Getting a little bored of wandering around a building avoiding the bad guys and just shooting them anyway.\n\nHelpful | 60\nDeveloper ResponseNov 22 at 2:22 PM\n\nWe're sorry for the issues you've been experiencing and we're working hard on improvements and feature extensions. Regarding the comfort mode, you can definitely turn it OFF. If you pause the game, go to \"Settings->Comfort\" you can disable the \"Espire Control Theatre\". That turns it off completely. With the holstering, if you go to the MAIN MENU, there's an option to \"RECALIBRATE\". Alternatively you can play the first 3 minutes of mission 1 again. If you adjust the Espire belt and chest holsters, hopefully you'll find a position for them where the holstering feels good during combat! We're working on improving this!", "paulgoo0Jan 28 at 12:35 PM\nExpire 1\n\nI wasn't sure whether to get game as some of the reviews said game was didn't work that great.

Regarding the guns you've unlocked, you'll find the guns sitting on a weapon rack close to the starting location of every mission. This is true for the cheat guns (Golden Gun, Silver Serpent), In every mission, the weapon rack is in a different spot. For Espire labs, the weapon rack is in a corridor to the left of the very first guard you encounter. For Reech Division, the weapon rack is to the right of the door protected by a laser grid (objective 1). In Research Sector, the weapon rack is next to the Espire backup crates (objective 1). In Data Centre, it's on the wall near the elevator shaft on the left. In Ventilation System, it's at the top of the elevator shaft, just before you go into the vent. In Basement Level one, the weapon rack is on the wall just after you make your way through the gate that requires the keycard. Hope this helps!", "dy.lan4778Jan 2 at 8:14 AM\n\nThe game now is really good, when you move its kinda hard to see so Id recommend making it to where you have full vision when you move. When it comes to the slow motion part I feel like they should better explain what button to press to activate it. Personally Id like the amount of energy to last a little longer just because it sucks when I use the thermal vision to see where enemies are then try an repair but then I have to wait.

The biggest problem is that the AI is broken, buggy and unpredictable meaning it's difficult to make tactical choices, almost everything gets you spotted and stealth is impossible. As other have pointed out the voice overs are excessive, especially telling you to heal. Guns are also very unsatisfying to use. If (!) these problems are ever rectified I would be interested in retrying it as the concept is great but execution is currently too poor to enjoy\n\nEDIT:\nSo after hearing devs have pushed a couple of updates I thought I would try again and I'm glad I did. AI still isn't great for a stealth game but isn't as buggy and I hear there will be a further AI update soon. Devs have been listening to feedback and that's a good sign.

Thanks for taking the time to leave us a review and rating! We apologise it's took a ridiculously long time to respond to this review but we can say since the game launched in November up until this point we've made vast improvements on the game and worked hard to make it as good as possible with a view to improving it even more. The AI is more controlled and realistic now as opposed to being a bit more erratic as you quite rightly pointed out beforehand. The graphics have improved even more with better dark and light effects in certain areas, the loading times are also nowhere near as long and we've also added new content in a major update we launched a couple of months back which adds new challenge types including weapons which enables you to try out a range of firearms on targets as you progress through new environments with the aim of getting the highest score possible on the leaderboards. The other new challenge type is called intel which requires you to hack into workstations across a range of more new environments and collect info before you escape which can make you feel extra stealthy and more like an agent. We hope you get a chance to try these out if you haven't already. In regards to hiding places we apologise if you feel there weren't enough however we can say it can take a bit of time to familiarise yourself with each mission environment and the hang of hiding efficiently. Once you know the maps more and the books and crannies you'll be hiding in a lot more spots. for example you can fling yourself upwards or climb up metal surfaces to scale the top of lights or hang from the ceilings, you can use air ducts which can lead to a few secretive places and as I say the more you familiarise yourself with each map the more places you'll discover. We hope all this helps and we hope you do give the game another try but if not we can only apologise once again and it's understandable if you don't wish to.

Click the '...' and make sure voice recording permissions are allowed. You can also make sure your Microphone is enabled in the Oculus Quest Settings. Finally, within Espire, go to the 'voice commands' menu and adjust the sensitivity there. -Your request for a profanity filter is a great one and we'll add it to our list.

Really fun game, except that the floor level constantly gets screwed up. I jump from a height and sink into the floor up to my armpits. Then I am like a rat scurrying about on the floor - it completely spoils the illusion. It also makes it difficult to grab my weapons. I could exit the game and rerun, but who wants to do that 10 times to complete a level. Not fun. I am sorry to have to request a refund.\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseJan 12 at 10:28 PM\n\nHi, sorry you've had issues with the floor height. This is the first we've heard of this issue and we are looking into it. Did you have any issues with any other Quest titles, or is just in Espire? For example, does the floor height look correct in your \"Oculus Home\" environment? Our first suggestion. Quit Espire, redo your guardian boundary and try to launch the game again. In the meantime, we are trying to reproduce the issue and will patch the game immediately if we find it.", "Pump_blockJan 29 at 7:10 PM\nAmazing\n\nI was playing for an hour or so and it felt like a minute and I forget where I was at (in the real world) but this game is amazing I suggest you should buy it\n\nHelpful | 2", "Rogue_m82Dec 23 at 9:16 PM\nUpgraded my review.\n\nGame is much improved after the patching done.

Thanks for the feedback. We've always designed this as 'MGS' meets 'Goldeneye'. On the normal difficulty, running and gunning is a totally viable option. On the hard difficulty,the run and gun approach is much harder. Have you tried the game on Hard mode? If so, we'll take on feedback and keep tweaking the difficulty. We could have more enemies deployed into an area if you're continually running and gunning.", "R3L0ad1Dec 27 at 6:09 AM\nGreat game, but needs a tiny bit of work\n\nI decided to buy this game despite the slightly bad reviews and its great! the graphics are fine and i didnt find many problems with it, but, the ai still needs a little more work, sometimes they see you through walls and it will alert the guards even if they shouldnt have seen you.

It lacks in every department and you will see that throughout the game. And it makes total sense, since it's not a huge developer with millions of dollars and years of time to develop such a title. Just keep that in mind when you are handing over those 30 bucks!\n\nI think the scope and ambition of this game is greater than its execution. It lacks polish(textures are absent or lowres), is sometimes glitchy (the hands and weapons) and clunky (the holstering, the animations) and I never really felt that I'm sneaking behind enemy lines and have to keep quiet and be clever about the approach. The graphics and overall lighting are subpar, especially after playing Red Matter.\n\nThe enemy AI is quite dumb. Example: When you are behind a grid and you have clear sight of the enemy but the enemy doesn't spot you although you are right in front of him. No big deal but takes you completely out of the immersion.\n\nI also wished that I had more options for in-game settings, like turn the music off or at least adjust volume for a more immersive experience. Or turn off the subtitles! I overall wished it had better sounddesign for more atmosphere!\n\nMany people didn't \"get\" the HUD but I think it's an outstanding way to prevent motion sickness and you can adjust settings to your liking or turn it off alltogether.\n\nDear developers, I know you put many, many hours into your game and I really appreciate what you have accomplished! Just keep up the good job and update your title from time to time and it will rise and shine! Thank you.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper ResponseDec 21 at 2:38 AM\n\nThanks for your feedback and suggestions. We are indeed a small team and are continuing to update the game based on player feedback.

It is possible to adjust audio/subtitle options in the settings and we have worked to make these settings clearer based off your review. Theres more coming in 2020. Thanks for supporting the game!", "austinj53Dec 29 at 10:04 PM\nWhat Vr action is meant to be\n\nI definitely understand that Vr is in its beginning stages. We cannot hold these titles to the same standards as average games. With that in mind this is a VERY well executed game. For what this game is it accomplishes EXACTLY what it is meant to and I have to applaud the developers on this. There are few games out there that are full games such as this, they are more like \"experiences\" more than games. Yet this puts me fully immersed in the world of what this is. There are plenty of great things I can say about this (gameplay, concept, style, voice acting etc.). I can definitely tell that the people behind this put full effort into this and took this seriously. I understand with the processing limits of a quest that there are things hoped for such as more advanced NPC AI, but for what they were given, these people have created nothing short of a great game.

The game asks me to do hold-ups and knockouts before telling me how to do them, thought Id missed something again had to guess. Not quite clear on the end of mission score screen, presumably spending less is better? A few things didnt make sense. Are those 5 greyed out stars at the top and I achieved none or just decoration? Past missions can be espire 1 or vr operative, what do these mean are they what I achieved or difficulty levels or what? Not clear if there is any benefit to being non-lethal vs mass murderer or if I should be doing one or either. Shooting with tranq occasionally does nothing, thought this might be an armour thing but sometimes shooting armour works. Guards sometimes just walk through their own trip mines, then they die but lazer and mine still there.\n\nAs others said the AI makes it feel like a very simple game, like playing goldeneye N64 simple. When stealth fails and guards all rush me and I kill them all it doesnt feel like an intended part of the game, almost as if you are supposed to die then but due solely to the AI I manage to kill them all and am like ...sooo....do I just carry on? If it felt like a proper you can do it the hung-ho way legit option would be fine, but it doesnt.\nAlso in climbing/sneaking challenges you can just shoot the guards (forget which) so felt a bit like er...am I missing something/doing this right?\n\nAll these make the game feel a bit simple, but if you can tweak them the framework is there for a killer 5 star must have game\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseDec 23 at 5:58 PM\n\nWow, thanks for the detailed review!

NEVER repair your Espire during a mission to unlock it.

The challenges I've played are fun and I really liked all the different uses for the repair tool. If I could have anything different it would be slightly more realistic/immersive reloads rather than just slapping the mag in, but that is a minor issue at most.

It's great. My one complaint so far is much different than some of the other technical complaints some players have. It's that I get so incredibly immersed in games like this that I REALLY get into it, but the game doesn't always support this. I was laying down prone above some enemies to hide from them and wanted to take them out, but when I went to grab my tranq gun, I realized I was in a game again when my holster was through the floor. I don't know if its possible, but I wish the game would register that if the headset is at a certain distance from the ground, the body model would shift to being behind the headset rather than under it so I can use my equipment properly.

Thanks for the great rating and review! :) We appreciate stealth isn't always ideal in many situations especially those where there's an abundance of enemies to take down one by one quietly or sneak past however the Espire unit has many abilities such as climbing, using Espire instinct (slow mo) Espire vision where you can see enemies through objects, and even the cameras on each hand can be thrown if you activate them, grab it with the other hand and then hit the audio button on the camera screen. This is a useful trick to luring guards out of the herd and take them down quietly. :) There are also many places to travel through such as climbing on ceilings, pipes, through vents and we strongly advise taking advantage of all of these things when attempting stealth. It can take some getting used to but the more you try the better you'll get at it and that's the beauty behind it as we've attempted to provide players with as many options as possible and play the way they want to play across relatively large scale environments. :) If all else fails then all guns blazing is certainly another strategy. :) We hope the stealth tips help you enjoy the stealth element a little more. :) In regards to the gun issue you're having can you possibly elaborate a little more for us as to what you're experiencing please? We would be more than happy to advise if we had more of an understanding. Thanks for playing Espire! :)", "arobbo458Jan 29 at 8:53 AM\nGreat game\n\nGreat shooter good story and great stealth action one of the best shooters out rn\n\nHelpful | 0", "PasdorJan 24 at 2:03 PM\nSadly my triggers broke but so far good!\n\nThe challenges and the starting room are very fun but I cant pass calibration because my controller is broke, 5/5 tutorial room and extra challenges\n\nHelpful | 0", "CorwiiDec 21 at 1:45 PM\nA great experience.\n\nI know a lot of people seem to be focused on bugs.

Ammo goes missing in the middle of gunfights; aiming in slow mode causes the gun to float towards you, and the audio to distort; doors that should open often don't; falling out of the game area into a pitch black glitch prison will make you restart a long level; and slowdown and audio stuttering can ruin a good fight.\nI've had some of the most fun in VR playing this game, but it never should have been released in this condition. 20 is not chicken feed, and it feels like an unfinished, deeply frustrating experience.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Sidx21Dec 30 at 12:30 PM\nGreat game, waiting on updates\n\nI agree when people say this has metal gear vibes, although to me this feels a lot like a bond movie with all the gadgets.

The game play feels good but the physics are clunky, I get stuck on walls often, weapons are awkward as well. The ai isn't that great either. Also the game feels rather empty as if it is a beta, there are games free on side quest right now that have just as much content as this. Also, this game is completely lacking in any multiplayer features, making the replay for this game very low, kind of sad with a game with physics this good and AI this bad... you would think the dev's would cash in on a multiplayer game. If I could return it I would, even though I got it for half price. If you are currently Looking for a good military shooting experience I recommend games like pavlov, you will be saving 40 dollars, and I guarantee you will sink more time in the alpha than this poorly put together game, to put it in perspective, I sideload half life 1, and qauke 2, and I have been playing that more than espire one.... that's saying something in my opinion...\n\nHelpful | 1", "Her0Zer0Denir0May 15 at 1:23 PM\nNo words!\n\nAll Ill say is great game!

It's something we want to bring back ASAP (it's present in RIFT via Oculus Link for now). We're always trying to discover and fix any crashes.

It's pretty simple. there's not a lot to do really.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseJul 13 at 3:43 PM\n\nHi there! Thanks for leaving us a great review and rating! We apologise if you feel as if the game is lacking in some areas in terms of content however we can advise on this front if you wish to take it. There's 6 missions in the main campaign all of which are large scaled environments whereby your Espire unit that you're controlling can do a variety of things and perform a certain number or different styles. The main premise of this game is to be stealthy but you can also go in all guns blazing if you so wish. If you want to make the most out of being stealthy we would definitely suggest using all the abilities in your possession as well as the areas on each map. For example when you control your Espire unit you can put your hand to head and pull the trigger and this performs Espire vision which gives you the ability to see enemies through surfaces and objects. It can be used for good strategic use when trying to get around a situation. You're also equipped with hand cams which you can use to mark enemies to always know where they are. These can be accessed by just hitting the triggers. Also around most of the maps there's air ducts you can go into which provides an alternative route and can be used wisely to avoid or even take down enemies. Combine all this with ability to climb any metallic surface and you can actually perform a great deal of stealth manoeuvres in each mission. In terms of going in all guns blazing and being more action based you can do this by simply doing as it says on the tin and shoot a large number of enemies however you also have the ability to use Espire instinct which slows down time. You can do this by holding the B button down and often works best as you're falling from a roof or as you're in the air so you can shoot a number of enemies at once while being airborne. We really hope all this advice helps your experience. We've also implemented some major updates since you kindly left us this review and launched weapon and intel challenges which require you to shoot targets and hack workstations across a large number of environments so there's now added replayability there. Something else we would recommend for replayability is attempting the side missions on each main mission in the campaign. These can be found on the mission select screen at the bottom left and if you hover your controller beam over each box you can see the requirements on how to do it. Once you complete one of these you can unlock a cheat which can unlock some super cool features such as tiny Espire, unlimited ammo, golden gun etc. Thanks for playing! :)", "steve13870Dec 13 at 12:17 AM\nGreat game\n\nI'm late to the party but so far i love this game ,I'm playing after the big update and having no issues whatsoever.

Very very cool mechanics that make you feel super cool. The idea of using you actual voice to do commands is incredible and when it works its amazing. This is what im talking about, this is what a true AAA experience should be like in vr. This isnt a tech demo, this is a full game. But, this game has some very ANNOYING glitches that will hopefully be ironed out. Like sometimes shooting dudes doesnt register at all, same with using commands with your voice against enemies, and punching them. The collision breaks sometimes. The climbing is amazing but trying to grab a wall sometimes results in grabbing a gun. Im sure these will he fixed but one thing that isnt a glitch, but just isnt really good is the reloading. You have the option to reload pavlov style or realistic but a clip just pops up on your chest every time you shoot anything so you can just slide your hand across your chest and reload the entire mag right there. It defeats the entire purpose and immersion of reloading the gun yourself. Sometimes when trying to reload yourself the clip on your chest has weird hit boxes so it reloads automatically, which again destroys immersion. This is just a nitpick but i would like a option to turn that off. I see people talking about the vision while walking sucks... but you can just turn it off if you dont get motion sick; turn on theatre mode in the settings.\nGET THIS GAME ITS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY QUEST.

Regarding the reloading, we made a decision early on to do mix of 'arcade' (waist) and semi-realistic (bring mag to gun) reloading. We didn't want to go full-Pavlov or Onward in terms of reloading. That's the first time we've heard a request to disable the arcade style 'waist reloading', but you make a lot of sense. We can add that as an option in the future, it might take a few weeks before we get there, some other bugs are top priority!

Objects dissapearing, even floors vanishing with AI falling through them into the eternal abyss of a black skybox. The game was delayed a day before the original launch, but it definitely still requires a lot more polish.\n\nWhen the game is working, it lacks challenge. The normal difficulty is hilariously easy, to the point that multiple enemies can shoot you for seconds before you die, which in a stealth game is absurd. Combine this with extremely strong abilities like seeing through walls, looking around corners with throwable cameras, or just generally deadly firearms that control well, but kill enemies so fast they barely get to shoot back. You could challenge yourself with a self-imposed playthrough where you don't get spotted at all, but why bother in the first place when the combat mechanics are so broken? It feels hollow.\nWorst of all, the hard difficulty is locked behind having to complete each level on normal initially.

These hopes have been fulfilled and the game works smooth in its own ways. Of course some things could be improved like for example the \"hold up!\" voice-action not working lots of times.. but overall the game looks astonishing and feels amazing.\n\nIt turns you into a stealth robot, crouching and swinging from wall to wall! (Disabled the crouch with button functionality by the way, who would do this!) I also like the campaign which at first I didn't seem to care much for. The ending keeps me interested and I'm curious for a part 2!\n\n2 remarks please take note of these:\n- restarting the game removes all checkpoints.. while aborting the game and starting it up again makes you spawn at your checkpoint. This is weird.. If I get caught, I want to restart at the checkpoint, not the level!\n- I got troubled a few times entering a new zone. When the area is swarmed with enemies I back up in the gate of which I have entered. And when I do, I go back to the old area and need to enter that one again to go back again to the new area. I cannot take shelter in the area between areas because of the switch. It messes me up. I don't know how you guys could fix this, but I had this several times.\n\nIn short, the game is exactly what I need. Everything is amazing!

It might be more recommended the developers change the theater mode to an option you turn on versus starting off with.\n\nThe only reason I give this one less star then v is because it's just not quite my style of game. I did enjoy playing at while I did trying to figure everything out but I felt like the introduction level was a little bit too slow. The strange pistol was kind of arbitrary as I ran out of ammo quite a bit. just not my cup of tea at the moment I might give it a try in 6 months to a year. Very fun game though I don't want to complain.\n\nthe climbing mechanics were fun I found myself on the ground more often than being sneaky in the sky towards the end I did a bit of climbing towards the roof which was fun.

It seems like I get detected every other second. The cameras on the hands help, but they're so far off to the side of my peripheral that it's hard to use effectively. The steal can seem so tedious that I ended up just wanting to go guns blazing so I wouldn't have it wouldn't take so long. I really liked how you could adjust your belt and side holsters, really great touch, however grabbing things from them can be fiddly. My last complaint is how often we're reminded to repair ourselves, it plays the same lines every time and it gets so annoying. Second last thing is how (save for the first slow motion) when an enemy sees you he immediately starts firing. Normally there's a buffer in games but in this they just start blasting off. But for positives, graphics are great, voice acting is above average, and the story does just enough to keep you entertained. One final touch is make the levels and corridors a little more stylized?

The maps are larger than I would expect from a quest game.\n\nI unlocked a few new starting weapons, but I have no idea how to equip them. I enjoy the fact that there are cheats added to the game, but many of them are discouragingly difficult to unlock, considering if you make a mistake, you have to restart the entire mission rather than start from the previous save point.

Awesome!\n\nThe game also has some real story to it, unlike some other great games here which really feed off good gameplay alone most of the time.\n\nThe world is detailed enough to enjoy just looking around too, and like Red Matter almost all the objects can be picked up, tossed around, and some may provoke some further story narration.

Thanks for leaving us some feedback along with a rating. We're sorry you felt a little bored navigating through the levels. We can only say the game is all about perspective. You could look at it as just a game where you take everyone out but you can also look at the fine details such as having the freedom to go about each situation and level in whichever way you wish to. We designed the game to build around player freedom so players can take out enemies in different ways utilising all of Espire's abilities such as using the hand cams, Espire vision, and Espire instinct along with various combat mechanisms such as using guns, landing on top of enemies from a height, or utilising melee with your tools and fists to get out of situations. You can also choose to be as stealthy or as loud as you wish and there are certain situations in the game which benefit from either of those methods. We hope maybe this advice helps you see the game from a different perspective but if not feel free to hit us on our Facebook or discord and we would love to explain the game further if you wished to hear or pick up any tips when playing. :) Thanks for playing Espire!", "TheTDGamesJan 26 at 2:40 PM\nJust Amazing.\n\nIve got nothing else to say.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Blazing_ThumbsJan 3 at 12:04 AM\nPretty much regret the purchase\n\nWatched multiple trailers and was severely disappointed in the lack of content.

My biggest 2 are that you need to be more explicit about which surfaces are climbable, and the rendering of the offhand controller while holding a gun is WHOLLY unnecessary. I wanted to climb across the ceiling that had the grid texture of the first climbable wall but it wouldn't grab as well as I've climbed ceilings in different rooms so it tells me that it should be possible but it wasn't. And the controller rendering was absolutely INFURIATING since the controller renders on the topmost layer and completely obscures the holo sight and makes it so that firing the gun is instinctive even when you look down the sights.

The freedom of choice and the size of the levels are unreal. This feels like a console game,\nI've played for over 4 hours and haven't even scratched the surface. And it's awesome.\n\nThe scale and depth of the levels are massive with long range gun fights and multiple ways of dealing with each threat/mission.\nYou can climb any metal surface and most boxes, rails, pipes and hang from walls/ceilings with one hand while silently tranquilizing enemies, picking them off one by one Batman Arkham Style,\nSorry nothing like gangnam style.\nYou could opt to use the ventilation shafts to go through the room with no hassle. Or you can manoeuvre yourself just above an enemy and pounce on him from above in slow Mo, max pane meets assassin's creed style\nOr just go on like a bull in a China shop. With a fire extinguisher, smashing enemies in the back of the head as you grab their weapon out of there hands as they fall to the floor. Down a zipline then sliding under a desk as you take the remaining enemies legs out with your auto rifle before dashing to the exit to repair your slightly damaged Espire unit.\nBut before you have had time to catch your breath you get detected by a camera above you, using your thermal vision you see a swarm of enemies running up the stairs. A room full off racking surrounds you with boxes stacked on each shelf.\nYou climb to the to the top of the racking remove one of the boxes from the top shelf and tuck yourself away where the box was and lay low until the era is clear.\nOops, you accidentally drop knock the box down and a guard hears it fall.\nYou draw for your silenced pistol, and it all starts again.................\n\nMay I add, alot of people have been complaining about gripping, not had any issues after I got used to the controls.\nSame with holstering weapons. I don't even have to look anymore u can easily distinguish where every weapon sits on my body.\nOnly issues I've had were a few dumb enemies that walked right passed me and 2 occasions where enemies were invisible. However when I shot them they had a white glow around them and then appeared, mabye they got invisible suits on, can anyone clarify?\n\nBar that if your having problems then it's probably you not the game.

It may lack in some polish found in other titles but something that is rarely found in VR his everywhere in this game. DEPTHS. They haven't simply made a VR shooter. They made a VR stealth shooter, with climbing, shooting, adjustable belt, voice activated features and much more. The game is visually ok, the Ai is lacking in some skills so you may be able to exploit it at some extent but the content and the game itself will keep you in VR. I started gaming in the 90's. My favorite games of all time were : Rainbow six rogue spear, metal gear solid, SWAT and ghost recon. With Espire1 I felt the exact same feeling. Good throwback in my memories combined with modern technology and it gives you Espire1.\n\nAfter 3h in espire 1 I can say that this title worth giving a shot. A long shot... a 6h shot.

I feel like Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit. Played for about 45 minutes with no issues in regards to motion sickness, gameplay, quality etc. Ive never used a Rift, Vive or other PCVR Headset before, but I can tell the graphics are reduced a little to play on the Quest, but you know what, Im good with that! Its really fun and different than any other game in the Quest library. I encountered one bug but it was not big deal at all. I was shooting two dudes on the platform with the four switches and they both went down, but one got back up and just stood there like he was frozen. It was strange for a few seconds and then I continued on. I imagine its the hardcore VR gamers that are more critical than people like me. Having this game on the Quest is proof that any type of FPS can run on this machine just fine, with reduced settings of course. Are the graphics super sharp and comparable to a wired unit? No, but again, Im good with that and thats why the Quest is what it is. You knew what you were buying from the start.\n\nI thought I was hearing things. Like someone had accessed my Quest after giving permissions to the microphone and photos in the initial install. It was really strange. I shut off access to the microphone a little while later, but I still heard a voice for a few seconds like it was someone talking in my ear. It was bizarre.\n\nLong story short, the game is great and look forward to playing again. In my opinion, I think $19.99 would have been the better price point than $29.99.

This is that.\n\nYou can move freely, grab stuff, climb, speak to enemies, and its all solid and engaging. This isnt the first game to feel like a full game experience in VR, but most others were either first-Party and massive money sinks, or mods to make a traditional game VR (Minecraft, Half-Life, etc).\n\nBoth of those avenues have made for amazing VR games, but to me, its smaller, more realistic dev teams that show the true health and viability of a platform.

Everything just works perfectly, some of the crispest graphics and controls on the Quest yet.\nEven if you've got strong VR legs, keeping some level of theater mode (pop up blinders that reduce your field of vision while moving) turned on definitely helps to reduce motion sickness. I turned everything off in the beginning, played for about an hour and felt fine while playing, but definitely felt a little queasy after.\nTurned lowest level of theater mode back on when I played again, zero motion sickness.

Earlier today i was playing and I'm in a laboratory similar to Facility on Goldeneye and even the music playing has a really similar sound of GoldenEye. Before long I'm using my hands to slide upwards or sideways to open vents and climb thru air chutes (again like GoldenEye) but when I jump down and land silently similar to Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell I suddenly have a couple guards on patrol that I stealthily dispatch with takedowns but 2 more come around the corner n surprise me. No more stealth. Time slows down and I use Max Paynes \"Bullet Time\" and pull out my machine gun and blow them away. In the next room I'm upstairs overlooking the lower level and see 2 more guards and I Zip-line across the room w one hand and with the other hand using my pistol I put a bullet in each of their heads like James Bond!! The game features heavy climb elements and they execute it masterfully ! The game is super smooth and has Red Matter-like graphics! Its phenomenal. The gameplay is incredibly deep and versatile. I was able to climb a wall and reach up grab the rail and while I'm hanging off the rail with one hand, i use my other to execute a silent takedown of a guard who is too close to the edge. Its very \"Mission Impossible\"-like and that was just one level. The UI has a Iron Man-like Augmented Reality overlay that the player sees.

I would say Espire 1 has less to do than other releases though.\n\n1 tiny annoying bit - I found the FOV for comfort to be too restrictive.

The game thrusts you into a world of espionage and action and as a full length experience, ebbs and flows between set pieces and larger open areas. Despite a linear path the game feels very open giving you the tools or weapons to choose your own response to situations.\n\nVisually the game has gone for realism over other more stylised graphic options and should be applauded for what they have squeezed out of the quest the hand cams being a particular highlight for me as duel aspect is difficult to work with these limitations.\n\nGameplay is solid, although the guards sensitivity seems somewhat superhuman at times and vacant at other points, this I assume will be updated and patched as the game goes forward.\n\nSound is good with the voice acting being a highlight, general SFX acceptable.\n\nThere are some quality of life improvements such as the \"theatre\" that grays in from the edges as you move. The options around this are there however as you adjust it you have to come out of 3 menus move see if you like it then go back in adjust and repeat. A simple preview button would speed this up and feel more user friendly.\n\nSecondly a sandbox would be welcome to test out movement, preferences and weapons nothing fancy.\n\nIn summary this game is a must for fans of metal gear solid, science fiction and vr and shows real promise for the future of this platform and the studio behind espire1,\nsynchronization 100%\n\nHelpful | 0", "hdvahl01Nov 25 at 6:50 AM\nGreat game but motion is not good\n\nI do not like the anti-motion sick solution they have.

I remember being a kid and playing hide and seek: forgetting to breathe as my friend walked past with a nerf gun. This is just like that, but its hide and seek with no rules. Oh, and you got guns. Every mission is at least 20 - 30 mins long, filled with nothing but action. Im on the 5th mission, still loving it as much as I did when I downloaded it. You can complete the game however you want : on most stealth games you try to think about what the game wants you to do, on this game I just thought about how I wanted to do it. Go sneaky or guns blazing? Set myself a challenge by using just the starter pistol? It was MY choice. For almost the first time ever, I could do whatever I wanted in a video game.\n\nAnd also - the replay ability! If you didnt know, on each mission you can get different badges, as well as completing tasks which give you access to 21 cheats, which, may I add, are so fun to mess around with. Want to fight enemies that are 30cm tall? Well, complete this challenge and you can! This gives you a reason to return to levels to get those badges and unlockables. As well as this - you have also got a training thing called challenges which are SO, SO much fun. The feeling of having 30 seconds to eliminate 8 guards just cant be beaten. A few bugs, nothing huge and dont really affect my experience. Graphics are actually pretty good, clearly not as good as PC but that is expected.\n\nQuick note to the devs, for some of the mods, for instance Tiny Espire, there are some flaws. For instance, on the first mission you cant reach the lever to open the door at the start of the mission, which is slightly disappointing. If you can, try to fix these, but overall 10/10 game, would buy again.\n\nHelpful | 0", "KhalciferNov 23 at 6:17 PM\nReally good\n\nThe game starts pretty good and im having a blast.

YOU CAN TURN IT OFF by going into gameplay and turning off the mode. Ill be honest, i was really frustrated with this because i had to go back and fourth figuring out how the hell im suppose to turn this option off. I hope that an update comes for new players to immediately get an option to turn on/off Comfort theatre mode but because my god i literally thought this was how the game was like and was about to drop a big fat 1 star on this game.

Thanks ever so much for the extremely awesome review and rating! :) It's great to see you can appreciate the variety the game has to offer in terms of its stealth and action elements as we purposefully intended when we created the title.

This game is really exciting! Its exactly a game like this I have been waiting for on the Quest.\nThe game plays really great and its so cool to be able to climb walls to take out security cameras and sneak around guards. The abilities you can use like the hand camera is fantastic and very immersive and like nothing I have ever tried.\nI tried to play this seated as well which worked really well so if you are a seated player you can still enjoy this game fully.\nThe comfort settings are also some of the best I have seen. I really wish there were comfort settings like these when I was getting my VR legs, but I am also happy the comfort system can be disabled.\n\nI have experienced some small glitches like dialogue boxes getting stuck on the interface and the chest gun stock obscuring my view, but future updates will iron out that stuff for sure.\n\nGreat job with this game!

Having worked for Kojima Productions Co. Ltd. And Konami prior. I know people will want this. But for its price, there really should be updates. I hope there are updates and bug fixes.

I got the game almost as soon as it came out and printer played it on both quest and rift. There were obvious day one issues such as AI and graphical bugs but, still, day one. I make it through the game and literally stand and shoot the \"final boss\" which was a joke, and got the espire frozen and hacked by someone important I guess. So I'm hyped to see where that was going only to have credits rolled. It's one building separated by a few missions and tons of loading screens. There HAS to be more story to this with the delays and the price, there just has to be more story, especially since the level list doesn't just say 1 to whatever, it's sections of level one. Am I missing something???\n\nOther than that, the climbing was fun even if it's but obvious what can't be climbed on, exploration was rewarded with extra weapons and paths which is a nice bit of detail, and the enemies were challenging even in an assault run. Being told to heal all the time was also a bit irritating but I think an update may have fixed that.\n\nIf I can get a complete story or find out what I did wrong to keep me from the rest of the game, it'd be worth the price.

Ive encountered tens of enemies who are frozen on the spot, weapon-less, and now recently, a few invisible enemies. I think its the running thats screwing everything up, everything seems to be loading poorly.

Its also super janky with the mechanics of the game because I was trying to reach my repair tool and always grab my gun. Its also just unimpressive. I felt like I was playing Garrys mod in VR because the graphics are real bad to even quest standards. Reloading sucks because there is no challenge of running out of ammo in a gunfight, just bring it somewhat close to your chest and it reloads.

Its so fun having a metal gear type stealth experience in vr! This game is a must have, only, there are some things that make this game feel underdeveloped. First of all, when the ai is looking for you, sometimes they stay still and yell stand down! Over and over, also guns and amp sometimes clip through the floor or in walls, and sometimes you can use your force power but the objects just dont wanna work, this is okay with guns because you can just pick them up, but thats a different story for ammo. They have this pretty cool tactic that lets them load in big areas without lag, but sometimes I turn a corner and I cant see anything but the walls, floors, and ceiling. Also, using your X-ray vision, sometimes things just wont show up! Also they have this power bar in the corner of your HUD that they dont outright tell you what its for, and when using a repair tool, for about half the game I didnt know the two were linked. And sometimes I feel like I have so much hp that I can just run through the area without any stealth and just kill everyone without dying. Finally, Im short, so short that Im right under the line of sight for the turrets, i can just walk right up to one and shock it without issue. But the game is still really fun and amazing, if you can look past the glitches this game is a must have! I especially love the challenges that are added on extra, this game is just packed full of stuff you can do! Id say the game is a little too much money for what it has. But still pretty worth it. Also this game has the longest story on quest, Ive spent almost 5 hours playing it now its amazing. Maybe a good way to circumvent some of the invincibility issues is to add a hard mode.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseNov 24 at 9:38 PM\n\nThanks for your indepth review. There's a lot of great feedback here, particularly on explaining how the repair tool is linked to the charge bar in your HUD, we hadn't received the feedback before and it makes total sense. It might take us a few weeks, but we aim to get to all the feedback, prioritising the bugs where sometimes you turn a corner and the level hasn't loaded correctly.

Are you referring to the tranq dart gun? After each shot, you'll have to grab the small piston at the back of the gun to load another dart. The tutorial then shows you how to reload (hover your gun over the floating magazine on your belt). Finally, drop the gun on your holster to continue. There'll be a vent with a small red padlock that you'll have to shoot! Cheers!", "holton538Nov 27 at 11:36 PM\nEhhh\n\nIt was okay. The settings option should be a lot clearer as to what they do and you should be able to adjust turning by looking.

Bonus points if you can customise this to your liking!\n6) AI and animations are a bit broken and being spotted or not is really hit and miss!\n\nI won't go into depth as it looks like many others have pointed out the same things.\n\nThis game has great potential and if these issues can be patched and fixed quickly it feels like it could be the beginning of a strong francise and I look forward to seeing what direction you take with the DLC.\n\nALSO +1 for a full Pavlov-style reload option as others have suggested!\n\nHelpful | 5\nDeveloper ResponseDec 2 at 10:15 PM\n\nThanks for your detailed review.

I keep getting grey screens, things to collect that are not there and stuck unable to move in places where you should freely move. The experience was topped off when getting to a certain level and what should have been a simple press button had me looking around for ages as to why I did have something on my wrist, only to read previous reviews showing this was another glitch.

If you have issues grabbing items from your belt, you can \"Recalibrate\" your agent to place your belt and chest holsters further apart. It isn't necessary to drop a mag on the ground to reload.

It's difficult to cater a game for everybody as this is a certain genre of game being a stealth action shooter so it naturally doesn't apply to everybody. In terms of it feeling slow for you have you tried going in all guns blazing in certain situations? That will usually invoke a lot more action based gameplay.

If it wasn't for the motion sickness I would consider the game fun but not a serious stealth title. It's closer to Goldeneye than metal gear\n\nHelpful | 2"]
