The app deserves 5 stars, and it is far more sophisticated than BoxVR. It's among the best workouts out there. And if you put extra effort in, it's the best. But I am already missing BoxVR, the environments of which I really loved (not to mention my saved songlists). Please bring BoxVR back as a retro option within FitXR, or sell it as a separate app. In fact, while I enjoy the techy feel of FitXR, I also like the homey bright feeling of the old gyms. I even miss the old glove color options. BoxVR had especially well-designed environments, as it was, and those should be maintained. Also, please offer a few more environment settings (5) in the new version so the old favorites can be accessed as well as new. And offer the glove color options again, please. Having the ability to adjust the setting was a wonderful way to begin a workout, and offered an important sense of variety/fun.\n\nHelpful | 442", "JDelekto25 days ago\n\nI have/had been using BoxVR for several months now as part of my daily routine. I was starting to get a bit bored, but I feel as if there were some changes that they could have made to improve it and spice it up a bit.\n\nI empathize with the individuals who did not like a completely re-written application switched out for something they were already using and I agree there should have been two versions and I would have happily paid for version 2.0 if I were provided a discount as a BoxVR owner.\n\nThat being said, I have tried FitXR and I do like the change of pace, but some features do not seem to exist in this rewrite. I haven't played it long enough to see if there are achievements yet (I had received all but two on BoxVR), hopefully, they still exist and there are new ones added.\n\nThe Good:\n* Added the ability to gauge hit speed, motivates for a more intense workout.\n* New streak goals for extra-strong hits (I feel the goals help motivate gameplay).\n* Ability to turn off squats per class; I have back issues, but missed out on some classes/music in BoxVR due to this.\n* Change of look for targets and environment. Different, but not for everyone.\n* Haven't run into lockups as I did on BoxVR, especially after long sessions which would then lose my stats.\n\nThe Bad:\n* Removal of custom playlists.\n* Removal of setting daily goals for playtime.\n* Only a single environment for playing.\n\nWhat Could Be Better:\n* Bring back custom playlists (show currently playing track).\n* Add a quick button option to add a track to a custom playlist during play.\n* Bring back daily goals for playtime and/or estimated calorie burn.\n* Add more than one boxing environment with different brightness/contrast.\n* Add the ability to change target skins/colors for variety.\n* Provide a 360-degree workout rather than just left/right stance.\n* Allow for special effects and sound event toggles.\n\nHelpful | 152", "MaxChoopJun 21 at 6:56 AM\nNeed to be more challenging\n\nI been working out on this for close to 2 months now. I first want to say thanks to the developers for making workout fun. Here's my constructive criticism. As my fitness level improves, the workout has been getting stale for me. I've then decided to purchase the Extreme pack to make my workout better. It's fun and again challenging at first, I feel that I will eventually not get the proper challenge after a few weeks. To further challenge my body, I've decided to use a weighted vest and that kicked it up a notch. Try it everyone.\n\nWhat I would like to see in the future is to have some type of fitness dial so that I can up the speed and tempo of the target coming at me. The developers should not treat this app with the same fitness level for everyone. Just add a way to rate yourself as novice, normal, or advance in fitness level and have the classes automatically change the speed/tempo for each workout.\n\nHelpful | 258", "pinkdocJul 30 at 4:29 PM\nDisappointing update\n\nI enjoyed boxvr though like many others felt the hooks and uppercuts were sometimes a bit glitchy, especially if you hold your hands in a proper boxing guard meaning the cameras might struggle to track. High hopes for the update to fitxr.\n\nUnfortunately, what a letdown. No choice of stage, lost all ability to make a custom workout using the songs available, a more restricted (i think?) Total number of songs. All survivable but the game itself is worse. The loss of a streak if you don't get the hook or uppercuts dead on would be less irritating if they had fixed the glitches above. But they seem as bad as ever. The exploding coloured rings are fine on lighter workouts but in the more intense ones , there are so many on the screen that you can't see what is coming next. I got a headache after an 11 minute intense session, where I had been happily doing 50 minute sessions in box vr.\nThe punch strength meter is a nice touch, as is the multiplayer but overall this is a downgrade. I hope the developers have plans to reintroduce the elements that boxvr had or I can see my go to for daily exercise changing.\n\nHelpful | 99\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nWere so sorry to hear that you feel let down by the new update, but Id really like to thank you for all of this feedback. With FitXR, were going to be constantly updating the game and taking on board any comments we receive so we can work to improve the game for our community. Thanks again and if you have any other suggestions or questions, please do drop us an email at support@fitxr.com as wed love to hear from you.", "decoy_effect24 days ago\nWas great, now less so\n\nWith todays update Im really disappointed in the direction BoxVR, and their parent co FitXR are taking. BoxVR was a cardio boxing app disguised as a rhythm game - with the official move to FitXR theyre taking an opposite approach in my opinion - by making a rhythm game and disguising it as fitness by revamping and prioritizing certain things in the HUD and UI.\n\nPrior BoxVR was great at what it was meant to be - prioritizing seeing your calories, time remaining and landed punches - all in large equal size. FitXRs prioritization of a 1 million point font size score, minuscule time clock, no calorie counter, large leaderboard and counter intuitive streak counter is all for the sake of making a it more of a game and less of a steam-lined cardio workout.\n\nHonesty this current version feels like a beta of what BoxVR was - the menus attempt to be pretty but bog down navigation unnecessarily; the beat saber-esque giant score board try to make it game-y, but its overkill - and limiting as we want from 3 back drops to 1; and for the first time after weeks of using BoxVR in long sessions (40-60 min) - this new UI made me feel nauseous. If this continues not sure I can keep using the app as my shelter-in-place workout.\n\nLayer in the lame attempt at getting user data by now requiring an email to start and not porting over any existing info from BoxVR - Im not as jazzed on this program as I once was - and feel good that I didnt invest in the DLC.\n\nThe few positive changes include:\n\n1. the updated block mechanic is much better\n2. better general tracking and punch recognition\n\nNote that while punch recognition is better, it is completely unclear on what types of punches count toward the new streak counter. As mentioned its counter intuitive predominantly in name, as it doesnt track your consecutive hits, it counts specific hits. Just what hits exactly Im clear as there appears to be no rhyme or reason to how to trigger the explosive animation.\n\nHonestly FitXR just deleted BoxVR - the game many of us paid for - and bait and switched to this version - which I might not have purchased. Id appreciate it if FitXR gave us all BoxVR back as a free app in its last form. They didnt pull this bait and switch on PSVR or Steam VR - as BoxVR is still their perfect their website - not sure why us.\n\nHelpful | 76", "mcole36417 days ago\nI just tried FitVr\n\nI just tried FitVR and it seems like a different game than BoxVR. I see what the developers tried to do. But I would have preferred buying this a separate game than losing all that I have worked towards in exchange for a few bells and whistles. Please bring back Box Vr and allow customers this option as either a separate purchase or give them an option in the main screen whenever they access game.\nEither would be preferable. The tracking of my hits after a session was what Forced me to be better than competing with other gamers.\n\nHelpful | 11", "wayne.camacho25 days ago\nDissapointed!\n\nI wasnt aware of this update and was surprised to see the Fit XR logo had replaced the Box VR logo. I gave it a try anyway.\n\nThis is not a game update. Its a game conversion!\n\nI paid for Box VR, not a watered down version of Audioshield.\n\nBox VR was great! Simple and easy! The ability to customize your workouts depending on your mood and energy level on any particular day made it even better! It quickly became my go to for cardio very soon after I bought it. All those months of customizing workouts and tracking progress are now gone.\n\nI want Box VR. I would have never paid $30 for Fit XR. I think its highly unethical for a developer to do what they just did. This is definitely not what I and others, based of other comments, have paid for.\n\nBring back Box VR or give us back our $30.\n\nHelpful | 95\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nWe're so sorry to hear you're disappointed with FitXR. Id really like to reassure you that this is only our first version and well be building on FitXR constantly and working to make this the best game we can, with the feedback from our community at the centre of our changes.

Because of their explanation I gave it a try anyway. Well, and I have to admit I really like the new style. I just did some short workouts, so I dont have tested it thoroughly by now. But I dont have any problems with exploding orbs or anything making it less playable than in the original version. It feels pretty fluent and to me it looks better than before. My understanding is the developers plan to improve the experience in future updates. And they already delivered with one feature: you can turn off squats in the workouts. This is very important to people with knee issues. Also it is already translated into some foreign languages.\nSo whilst liking it already Im looking forward to the updates ahead. Ill be updating this review. Lets see if they can get the fifth star from me...\n\n\n\nWhy do I have to give out my email address to play the new version? I bought it as Box Vr and now I cant use it without giving the developer some data? Id ask for a refund if I could right now. And then I read other reviews saying its not the same and less fun now. Im always open for changes, but this really feels like youre killing it. At this point I dont have any curiosity how the update plays. Also, Im the kind of guy who buys expansions if I see some added value in them, but not like this.\nThe two stars are for the underlying Box Vr. It wouldve gotten at least 4 stars by me a few weeks ago.\n\nIf I can run and play it without having to register my email Ill try again.\n\nHelpful | 12\nDeveloper Response23 days ago\n\nThank you for your review and we're sorry to hear that you're disappointed with the new update.

It went from 3 stages to one stage. This stage is terrible for me. I do not have depth perception so I do not like the dark space stages. It is very hard to judge where and when the ball is coming. I really liked the boxVR first stage,old fashioned gym but I had pillars so easier to judge where and when the ball comes in.\n2. When I played boxVr it feeled like I was playing somthing different, than music and rhythm game, now it exactly like playing audicia or synth rider.\nI hope at least more stages to choose from is coming.\n\nHelpful | 41\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nThank you so much for your feedback about the new update.

However I didnt realize that meant making the game functionally worse and less customizable. No more custom playlists, zero effort made into importing your own music, now everything is find an instructor, pick ONE genre if music. There are threads scattered across the net asking and begging for implementing custom songs and yet nothing. I can't recommend a game when features are taken out as opposed to being refined and made in addition too. This comes off tone death to those who have been playing it since the beginning, why would I want to continue to support your studio? Don't buy, updates take too long, and they take more away than they put in. All you needed to do was add some more basic functionality, skip songs, improve response times, and a better interface for moving songs around the playlists. Thanks for the better graphics but was anyone paying attention to the user base?\n\nHealth risks?\nEverything is dangerous, I'm sure if someone played rockband long enough they'd hurt their fingers or ears. I'm sure carpal tunnel is a risk of almost every long term gamer. Heck seizures are a potential threat to anyone who looks at a screen. Throw up the disclaimer at the beginning of the game, there's already a TOS that has to be checked off by the user. Sorry I'll buy that you weren't happy with the previous algorithm, but I doubt the health risks were something that should be seriously considered by anyone other than through disclaimers. Also I don't understand and forgive my ignorance, I don't see the correlation between your team not liking the previous playlist algorith, and me being able to create my own. Appreciate the response, good luck on future endeavors.\n\nHelpful | 84\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nThank you so much for your feedback about the new update and were so sorry to hear that youre disappointed. With the custom playlists, as a company we werent happy with the quality of workout produced by our algorithm which powered the playlists. We therefore decided to remove this as we wanted to ensure that any workouts available through our platform meet our workout standards and dont pose a health risk to our players. Saying this however, our aim is to constantly update FitXR with our community at the centre of any changes and user generated content is something that we are very interested in.

To my surprise box vr requires an internet connection to even launch! How that was even considered a good idea boggles my mind. There literally 2 reasons to even use the internet for this title. Updates and scoreboard. The FREAKIN WORKOUTS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE INTERNET ACCESS TO USE!!1!111!1! WTF!\n\nHelpful | 83", "tina-j25 days ago\nBox VR?\n\nWhere do I begin, this update is awful, it has completely changed and I need the version of Box VR back that I paid for! Visually and physically, this update is worse for me. There is no longer a choice of  gym venue it is just one dark area which makes everything far too bright. Gameplay is glitchy and laggy and it appears that I have apparently shrunk since last using Box VR as the calibration for the squats/ducks is for someone very very short and Im only 5ft 2! You can no longer see your calorie burn as you workout, you now have to wait until the end for a final score and you can no longer receive feedback on how well you punched, ducked, blocked which used to be shown when your session had concluded as this has been removed too. The facility to alter the position of your gloves has gone and is now a fixed position. Finally, for anyone with visual depth perception issues this current update may cause problems in gameplay not to mention the exploding orbs blocking your view after power punches. I really wanted this update to be an improvement but having tried it I can only ask that at the very least the developers add in a mode where you have the option to play Box VR as it was. This should never have been an update, it should have been a brand new game.\n\nHelpful | 75\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nWere really sorry to hear that youre not enjoying FitXR, but I want to thank you for your valuable feedback.

The graphics look a lot better, the feedback from the virtual instructors is much better when it used to be nonexistent. All of downloadable music is still there. You you still feel like youre going into a gym.\n\nThe game mechanic is basically the same, but it has been tweaked to have you punch harder and move more. Which is the goal. You wont get much of a workout if you dont punch hard and fast!!\n\nIn the old game it was possible to really not get any exercise at all by just kind of swinging and hitting targets. You can do that here too, but you wont get all the positive feedback or the better streaks.\n\nThe calorie count is displayed on the dashboard when you login or after your workout. People arent even looking. Its right there in front of your face, although it is not shown during the work out which I agree should be brought back. Or get an Apple Watch and look down at it through the nose hole on your headset every few minutes. I do think it should come back though.\n\nOverall I find this an incredibly impressive upgrade in every single way. And for free!! If you can open your mind up to change, I think if you use it a little while too too will also be very impressed.\n\nPros:\n- much much better graphics\n- players are rewarded for doing actual work that raises the heart rate\n- the feedback is great to hear even if rote; keeps you motivated\n- the targets are a little easier to hit and offer much more visual feedback to help guide you I to working out more\n- squats are lower and make you actually work\n- Im getting higher HR out of the new workouts (the old medium is now hard)\n- there are tutorial videos that show you how to actually have the correct stance and punches\n- the gym looks beautiful and futuristic yet is still a gym / building\n\nMy list of suggestions/cons:\n\nUPDATE: removing one star as Ive worked out with this for a few days now extensively. I still enjoy it but there definitely needs to be some improvements. \n\n- offer a daytime version of the gym in addition to the night version that is there now.

And I think thats because they stopped playing the game. I dont know whats going on there (EDIT: this is a known bug that will be fixed in an upcoming patch)\n- make it easier to sort the classes by duration. I miss that.\n- add a tutorial video for people coming from boxVR to explain the differences and changes\n- A good number of the old classes and old songs teams to be gone. I wish they would bring them back. Some of the songs were really good to work out to.\n- I agree that some of the part of all affects should be turned down just slightlyyyy unless its a super hard hit. During extremely intense of workouts sometimes your vision can get cluttered with all of the explosions.\n- and the number of the workouts I feel like the beat count is off or the tracking is a little off. Im not sure if some background processing is happening or something, but in a couple of the workouts that Ive had recently it didnt seem like the beats were perfectly timed. I was also missing hits that I know for a fact I made. It seems like a little tweak to the tracking on occasion would be helpful. I dont want to note that this was more of a rare occurrence than a common occurrence. But I did notice it on occasion\n\nHelpful | 10", "Bigchief2320 days ago\nGreat cardio experience\n\nthis is a great cardio experience for anyone looking to get into doing cardio or the experienced people. i cant say anything bad about it, but one thing i would love to see is the ability to add custom songs.

Then you changed it. Completely. It is almost 100% different from the game I purchased and not in a good way. Those halos have to go! Or at least make them optional. I used to play until I was nearly a puddle on the floor in order to reach 100% on a level...you took that away \nI also struggle with motion sickness but was fine in the original version...I find this new version more difficult to take.

Its a visual upgrade that includes new music and features, but its a mixed bag of what it added and what it took away.\n\nTheyve added group classes (which you can turn off). You can now turn off squats if you need to for say a hurting knee or sheer exhaustion. And the whole program seems updated to be flashier and more modern.\n\nNow a plus, but more of a minus. Theyve now placed an emphasis on scored points and the strength of your hits. In fact your power hits are scaled based on speed/force and the dashboard shows you a streak as you go. Your point multiplier is based upon a power hit streak and no longer based on how many hits you make period. I never cared about my total score. I cared about my end percentage of hits. I wanted to challenge myself by making sure I hit all the hooks, the blocks, the ducks, etc.. FitVR doesnt show that information at all anymore. Just your total points score. For some this is great, for some they wont care. With so much data being tracked, why cant we have both?\n\nTo be honest, FitVRs total emphasis on power hits becomes a de-motivator. You cant keep hitting at the speed it wants if youre doing this for longer workouts, or if, like me, youre doing this at the end of a weight workout. Youre tired. No matter how fit you are. So you play and just watch your streak and high streak go nowhere. Even if youve hit hundreds of hits in a row. Thats no fun when it used to be fun to see I hit 1790 hits in a row in BoxVR at the end.\n\nAs for the group classes, right now it feels like its a pseudo-class. Theres no way oculus has so many players online to fill the class with you. What it seems like is that FitVR creates random players to box with you in the room to motivate you in the beginning. Why just the beginning? Because youll notice halfway through their scores stop going up and you rise to the top of the class. Theres no way in every session Ive done that EVERYONE drops out.\n\nBack to the main menu and stats. It appears you can no longer see which classes youve already done at a quick glance (because the percent you got in BoxVR is gone now). Nor are the categorized by how long they are. Its just random. You can have a 9 minute class listed then a 59 minute class next to a 22 minute class. Why? This is such a simple fix since the menu was so clear on BoxVR. Also, without entering your weight, how accurate can the calorie burn count be?\n\nI still enjoy the boxing part of the game, but for the first time Im interested in seeing what else is out there. The biggest reasons being that I dont care about total points. I dont like being de-motivated by my lack of power hits as I get exhausted. And I miss seeing how my percentages add up at the end of a session. Seeing that 100% next to a class is rewarding. It drives you go want to complete all of them and go back if you didnt get 100%. That was more motivating me me.\n\nIm still playing, just bummed.\n\nHelpful | 24\nDeveloper Response24 days ago\n\nThank you for your feedback.

In other words, well get to re-pay for what weve already paid for. This is a con. Theyre apparently under a new management model, and in their meetings theyve apparently brainstormed for the fastest and cleverest ways to maximize their profits, at your expense.

BoxVR (what this was) was my absolutely most favorite app on the Oculus, and a primary part of my fitness regimen. I loved the feel, and the content. Now with FitXR, this is no update, this is throw the baby out and replace it will a doll. I might somehow tolerate the complete loss of user account and accumulated data (I've been using it for months, all gone, just like a new app). I might somehow tolerate the loss of setting/scenes for no apparent reason. I could tolerate cluttering it up with multi-player functionality that I won't use, but maybe somebody will. I might even trade many things off for the new content you've made available (I assume for purchase) since there hasn't been any since March. But you also took the haptic feedback/vibration away. Sure, it might be cool to have hand tracking, but that controller feedback was the only thing that provided sensation of a punch, and it made a world of difference in engagement. And you didn't have the forethought to consider leaving any of this old functionality in place for someone who may have been enjoying it, or providing any mechanism to turn controller vibration back on. I turned this off after about 6 minutes today, and don't even want to see it anymore. I will complain to Oculus and try to get my money back, because an update this big has robbed me of the purchase I enjoyed. I would have returned this version in a heartbeat. This was such a radical change I'm not even sure I'm keeping my Quest at this point. If the Quest Appstore allows you to totally kill a purchase this radically, then there is no sense in investing.

When the community was asked what we'd like to see, I only wanted more environments. I was disappointed to see that there used to be fun things like punching skulls. So I was excited to try the update after a \"it's too hot in my VR room\" break, expecting only improvements.\n\nInstead we have what is essentially the all new FitXR. One environment and tracking lag. Sure, there's extra visual fidelity with all the shiny bits, but this I can only assume is the reason behind the new lag. Even on basic tracks, many times my hand passed through targets, hearing the spheres \"hit\" a second after they pass behind me, like the main loop is catching up. That's if they registered. Aesthetically, I'm not fond of the new one-size-fits-all style, especially if it is costing frames. Whatever the case, I am a bit disappointed. I think this should have been introduced as a new app, not a forced replacement.\n\nWhat would make me happy? Performance settings. Let me turn off those new glowy bits and up the tracking priority. And for goodness sake, speaking of backgrounds, please stop taking them away. We've gone from 6 to 3 to 1.\n\n[UPDATE] Alternatively, as another reviewer put it, please give us a BoxVR mode (or similar) that brings back the old styles and options. Or, if it is a different codebase with a clean break, just give me back BoxVR, and I'll separately try FitXR.

This was BoxVR and, it was replaced by a dramatically different game on 30 July 2020.\n\nThis is a wildly disappointing downgrade from BoxVR. BoxVR had some issues but, I really liked it. I would like to have seen the developer fix the glitchiness with blocks, dodges and tracking hiccups that made your fists pass through targets you hit spot on. I was able to assemble custom playlists of songs that didnt have annoying sequences where you had to dance instead of throwing real punches. I got to choose music I wanted from a fairly large catalog. I liked the nice, plain, brightly-lit gym environment.\n\nFitXR does away with the custom playlists. You can do the classes they provide and, thats it. It does away with the bright, plain gym environment in favor of a cyberpunk video game scape. You get an annoying trainer voice distracting you. Apparently, there are some new social features. Im not really looking for social in my VR workouts.\n\nIn other news, they suddenly need your birthdate and email address so they can attach your game/workout data to your actual identity and, use it for marketing purposes. Thats also not an improvement.\n\nI feel like I finally found a gym I liked and, it just closed down.\n\nI see the developer responding to critical reviews with a cut-and-paste response. Its great that you are going to keep working on things but, find a way to let users switch back to the previous BoxVR version until you can get something we dont hate.\n\nUPDATE: I gave it another try and, figured out that you can turn off the annoying trainer voice. You have to pause a class after you start and, there is a box you can uncheck. That should be in the settings, too.\n\nTrying several more \"classes,\" I remain disappointed and sad.

I've been playing it as BoxVR for some time now and thoroughly enjoy it as that. I love being able to make custom playlists and despite some issues here and there it's an overall great game as BOXVR!! If you haven't updated it yet then I recommend you don't. After reading all the reviews post update it has made me 100% weary of updating the game. No custom playlists? No access to previously purchased DLC? No thank you. On top of that it sounds like none of the real issues that were in the original were fixed at all, rather it seems like they were made worse. So no thank you I'll keep my game out of date as BoxVR until the devs correct all these things and ACTUALLY LISTEN to the long running fan base who has been enjoying their game and offering good feedback. I watched this game rating drop quickly in only a few hours and it's all due to the new update. So devs I recommend you take a good look at that and ask yourselves what the hell happened. I strongly recommend you offer people who enjoyed the original game a chance to revert and then go from there.\n\nUpdate: So my game updated itself last night despite me constantly telling my quest not to update.

The immediate difference I noticed was the way the streaks were registered originally your streak continued as long as you hit the notes, now you have to absolutely wail on every note in order to continue your streak. The devs say they removed custom playlists for health and safety reasons, then explain to me how making someone put a lot force into every single punch in order to maintain their streak is healthy? It isn't! I bought BoxVR as a way to supplement my martial arts training during the pandemic, unfortunately the dojo I trained at ended having to permanently close. So I still felt a small glimmer of hope since I could do this in my free time to continue some elements of my training like striking targets and focusing on my footwork as I did so. It was nice because I don't have access to a training partner so this was a nice alternative, at least until the takeover.

This became incredibly important during the pandemic. While BoxVR was great, it was not without it's flaws.\n\nFast forward to July 30th when BoxVR gets an entire redesign/upgrade and becomes FitXR. The team at FitXR created an entirely new application that took away many of the main features that made BoxVR so great: custom playlists, longer classes, multiple environments (especially a brighter one for accessibility), and live real-time multiplayer.\n\n\nFor those of you, like me, that want the most out of a VR workout experience this app is for you too. With the new update they have added a new power gauge that is essentially a \"Test Your Strength\" meter that challenges you to hit faster. This created an immediate feedback loop that had me punching harder than I ever did in BoxVR. I did one 20 minute Intense class today paying attention to the meter and by the end of the workout class I was dripping sweat. My arms were very sore, and after spending a few more days realized I was sacrificing form for speed because you have to pick faster the 4m/s for your hit to count toward a streak.\n\nThey had good intentions, but did not go about this \"update\" the way that they should've. Either refunding people and giving them the option to buy the new game again if they want to, or reverting this back to the original BoxVR and offering FitXR as a separate app.\n\nHelpful | 9", "Llj556423 days ago\nBoxVR Ruined!!!!!\n\nI bought BoxVR last year and have enjoyed using it until this recent update to FitVR has made it only fit to be uninstalled.\nThe developers response to P981 shows that the changes have been made for nothing more than to obtain data for marketing reasons.\n'We've asked for you to provide your birthday and gender so we're able to give you the best statistics to make the most out of your workout' - I used BoxVR for 10-15 minute workouts and had no interest in the statistics and so there is no reason to force me to provide details.\n'We've also asked for your email address as this will be your FitXR account ID, which means you can use this to access your account across multiple devices and apps. Wed never sell this information to any other companies and would only contact you for exciting new product updates, personalised workouts and information about your stats' - BoxVR was only used on the Quest and no other device and the option for multiple devices is of no importance to me so an account is irrelevant.\nIf as the developers say that the information isn't for any third parties or marketing reasons then they should have offered an option to skip the profile for those of us not interested in using an account just for a short workout.\nClearly the developers have no interest in their existing customers and are happy knowing that so many of them have now had their money wasted!!!!\n\nHelpful | 23", "artfull32Apr 18 at 9:36 AM\nAwesome! But might I suggest...\n\nThe game does one thing EXTREMELY well. It makes working out fun! My wife and I do not like working out. It always feels like a chore. I actually get excited about playing this and easily burn 400+ calories in 30 minutes. It provides tons of positive feedback with the hit sounds, haptic feedback, scores, etc. I had so much sweat today that I was slipping on the floor because of my sweat (playing barefoot, lol). The different types of punches add a nice variety and doing it all to the beat of a song makes it so much easier and enjoyable. Once you get the hang of it, you can go on streaks of 300+ hits with ease, just following the beat.\n\nThat being said, I have several suggestions that can make this game an easy 5 stars...\n\n1) Please add the ability to hop/jump in place consecutively. This could mimic jumping jacks or even the hopping that boxers do in the ring. All you have to do is add little bumps that appear on the ground that you need to hop over as they pass. By monitoring the movement of the headset up and down, the quest should be capable of perceiving the jumps. Additionally, you could add bars that you must hit with your head in between squats to ensure you are rising in between, rather than just staying down. Both of these would add a whole new dynamic to the game and way more potential calories burned.\n\n2) Add side steps while youre at it. Boxing consists of a lot of shuffling in the ring, so why not add this to the game? Beat saber does this with vertical walls that force you to shuffle left and right, not just dodge. This would be HUGE!\n\n3) Why not add a couple of beautiful dojos. Perhaps one on the edge of a mountain or by the ocean. This could transform the experience completely!\n\n4) Please please please change the sound effect that occurs after getting 50 in a row. It sounds almost identical to the sound that occurs when you miss.  Easy fix for an otherwise confusing occurrence. Im always thinking Im missing punches rather than completing a streak.\n\n5) You have to have workouts that indicate difficulty level, type (focused punching, squatting, etc.), and maybe speed. This would make choosing a lot easier.\n\n6) Lastly, I plan on adding arm weights to my workouts in the near future, but I would LOVE to see an option that you can indicate extra weights so that the burned calories accommodate for this change.\n\nAdd these things and I guarantee you will have more people raving about this game!!\n\nHelpful | 472", "nikki.rood35 days ago\n \n\nI bought BoxVr a couple weeks before the update. I had my eye on it for months and was eager to try it. I really liked it when it was BoxVr. I liked the feel waaaaaay better than FitXR. I am so annoyed with this game right now!!! I literally had to stop playing mid workout and write this review. You have to basically flick your wrist at the end of the punch or you lose your streak because the game won't recognize your punch. I don't punch that way, I'm not sure anyone does, so it's super annoying to have to constantly think about that as you're punching so you don't lose the streak. I hate that.... A LOT. You can hear that you've made contact, but no flick, no streak. Infuriating!!!! I miss the different locations. I miss the original streak counting. I miss the option to create your own workout. Matter of fact, I was in the middle of creating my \"create your own workout\" when the game crashed and suggested I update, so I did. When it finally finished updating, BoxVr was gone and so was my workout I just spent 10 minutes trying to create!! Then, lo and behold, the option was no longer available either! Grrr. I tried it out and noticed that I had to punch different to make it count. I gave it several chances and I'm so very disappointed each time. I took a couple weeks off hoping there would be another update in the meantime, but no. I tried again today and it makes me so mad, I wish I never bought BoxVr turned FitXr in the first place!!!!!!!!

You shouldnt have to flick your wrist to get an explosive punch - instead youll just need to hit the cues at a certain speed (jab or crosses need to be hit at at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S).

LOVE it. When I saw that it had become FitXR I fired it up, saw the graphics overhaul and thought, hmm, OK, I can dig it... and then I started playing.\n\nThe hit streaks are gone as they were. Now streaks are based on punch intensity, and you have to punch HARD to streak. It's an invitation to a shoulder injury on an intense workout. The old streak system was much much better. It was simple, easy to understand, penalized misses and rewarded consistent contact. It was perfect incentivized cardio. This is just a stupid hot mess. Give us more points for harder punches, sure. Don't make it the whole basis for a streak system.\n\nThe information presented to the player is arranged extremely poorly. Why do I need a massive scoreboard? I need remaining time, I need how many hits I've connected with, I need calories burnt. This is a workout app. This information has all been minimized and is difficult to see, in sacrifice to a massive score counter that I couldn't care less about.\n\nThe rings from the explosive punches get in the way of visibility of the next hit markers, it makes it harder during an intense workout.\n\nThe calorie counting is completely off... and I can't even enter my weight in my profile! How in the heck am I burning 450 calories in a 21 minute workout? And how could you know that if you no longer even prompt me to enter my weight?\n\nUgh, this just sucks. Did you solicit feedback from the community at all before developing this? Your steam forum for BoxVR is locked from community comment, it's just a handful of sticky posts from the dev team.

I used to see group announcements on Discord so that people could get together and work out together. No more. If you sign up for a group class, those players are not live! It is ghost data from previous players. And who are they? Are they the best of the best? Can I play somebody at my level so that I'm always not in last place?\n\nEqually as hateful is the dark environment. I am an older player, I do not like dark mode in anything. I am one of the few who does not like beatsaver, Audica, Synth Riders, or any of those dark mode flashy games. I like -- LOVED -- BoxVR. I like the look of a brightly-lit vintage gym, something like Thrill of the Fight. As a matter of fact, I think Thrill of the Fight is going to be my go-to cardio app from now on. That's sad because I really stood behind boxVR and told everybody about it.\n\nDarn it, why they have to go and ruin a really good thing.\n\nHelpful | 20\nDeveloper Response23 days ago\n\nThank you for your review and we're sorry to hear you're not a fan of the new update.

There is less functionality now, fewer rooms, you have to make an account and the tracking is (still) inconsistent. It wouldn't surprise me if the developers will try to make us pay extra to get previous functionality back after a while. Very disappointing.\n\nUpdate: I have played the \"updated\" version of this game quite a few times now and I'm still thoroughly disappointed. When I play against the other avatars, the tracking appears more laggy and I can't look at the avatars anyway, because I'll miss my own punches. Basically, the only motivational aspect could be the leaderboard that you can view throughout your workout, but I highly doubt whether this leaderboard reflects reality. Since you're now supposed to hit the blocks at a certain speed to keep your streak going, it has become almost physically impossible to do so when the blocks come at you in a very rapid succession. I'm in good health and quite fit, but there simply isn't any time to make those arm movements in a natural way. Nevertheless there will often be an avatar with a 50+ streak (early on) while I'm stuck at 10.

I love what boxvr has become after this update. I love the new effects and animations. The punch gage is an awesome touch, seeing how hard I'm hitting really makes me want to throw more into my punches. I love multi-player as well and it's great to be able to see how I compare to others. The songs are much better and flow so perfectly with the punches. I don't know why all these people are complaining about not being able to see calories when it shows them right after each level.\n\nOverall I think the devs did an amazing job with this update and if happily pay more just to buy xrfit at this point but thankfully the devs gave it to us as a free update. Don't listen to the negative reviews from ppl who can't adapt to change. This game is now far superior than boxvr ever was and I'm sure it will only get better with time. Awesome job devs.\n\nHelpful | 5", "jzulkeski21 days ago\nFitXR is not BoxVR\n\nUPDATE: Dev claims they removed playlists for \"fitness standards\". Do not pretend to know me. It's insulting.\n\nYou took my favorite game and ruined it. After playing for 2 days, here's my issues with the game:\n\n- The presentation of hit directional indicators is less intuitive and they are too short.\n- The Block indicator regularly obscures the view from what is coming next, causing a miss.\n- You took what was a great tool for challenging myself and made it so that it's based around challenging others, which is the opposite of what I want. I want to workout, not be competitive.\n- Score streaks are impossible and hits don't count correctly anymore.\n- There is too much going on. There are too many things to look at while you're training.\n- I dont' want to be in some futuristic stadium. I want to be in a gym atmosphere like how BoxVR was.\n- I WANT MY CUSTOM PLAYLISTS RETURNED. I don't care what FitXR's fitness agenda is.\n- Everything doesn't need to try and be Peleton. It's overdone.\n- Put a lobby in the front of the entire game that allows you to select BoxVR or FitXR (or maybe \"Original\" and \"Ruined\" mode) and stop trying to fix what isn't broken. If you can't put a lobby in place, make a separate app and GIVE ME BACK BoxVR.\n- Controller tracking now regularly makes my hands \"float away\" (I have hand tracking turned off)\n\n----original review----\nYou should have given BoxVR users a second app. This new one with no custom playlists, wiping all my previous completions, requiring online to play and asking me for all my personal information is trash. On top of it, the streaks do not calculate properly. It's showing me miss even though the \"notes\" (or whatever you call them) explode. My left hand now regularly floats away causing missed notes. As the \"game\" stands right now, I cannot recommend it, and will be looking for a way to sideload BoxVR.... you know... what I paid for and a better game.\n\nHelpful | 18\nDeveloper Response22 days ago\n\nWere really sorry to hear that youre disappointed with the change over to FitXR and Id like to reassure you that were taking all of your comments on board.

I boxed sometime 2 - 3 times a day . It was a great addition to my running. I really enjoyed when I was able to catch someone to box against, rare but fun. I loved the gym look, it really got me hyped and feeling like i was working out. I do not like the new updated look, it takes away from the feel of being in a gym. If anything they should have just added the new environment and gave us a choice. I got very excited about joining classes. I find that when I am able to compete against others, it forces me to really work harder. What a let down, it seems like you are not really boxing others, during the classes, everyone else in the class freezes right about the second level or when you switch stances.Which makes me think they are not live people. Probably bots or something. So now, my favorite Quest app, is no longer my favorite. Now, instead of looking forward to working out on Boxvr, I dread working out on FitXR. 15 minutes seems like an eternity. An OK workout, but I am not a fan of the new look or setup!

I can't even get FitVR to get beyond the new setup. First, it forces me to create an account, something I'm not interested in, and then it hangs at the set difficulty level. I lost 20 minutes, the normal time of my BoxVR workout, trying to get it to work.\n\nObviously this app wasn't ready, but more importantly, this was not the app that I purchased.

WTF\n\nI'm very upset that without any warning at all, yal just totally took away BoxVR and replaced it with something completely, FitXr. You need to return our $ for BoxVR bc this was not an update. Now with this new bad version, I can't play with friends in real time. When I got on the new version, I actually liked the designed and I thought I was playing in real time with others in the class. I was so STOKED with that update. But on the 3rd day playing, I realized that the class is FAKE. The leader board scoring is FAKE. I went on with my sister and we tried to join the class together is what confirmed the fraud. I was wondering why the classes seem to always be full when on BoxVR you would rarely see much activity in the multiplayer classes. At least that is what has been my experience playing after work hours in the evening. So after realizing I no longer can play with friends and family, and the leader board scoring is fake... I lost interest and motivation because it's NOT COMPETETIVE. It could at least have a leader board among social media friends like Beat Saber. Now lets talk about the Streak Score. HATE IT, but could love it if you would also include the normal Streak Score as well. You have to punch really hard and super fast at the same time to keep up the streak. Yes it does make you work harder but you shouldn't lose credit because you didn't hit it hard even though you actually did hit it. It's fustrating! In BoxVR you got streak credit for every punch you hit. I mean isn't that what a streak means?\nNow the classes, Not much there. And not much of a variation. There's no Hip Hop music for classes with Intensity level. I have a problem with that. I'm a professional Boxer, and Hip Hop music is the main music in the boxing community.

BAIT & SWITCH!\n\nHonestly, I am pretty livid right now and I would give this app 0 stars if I could. I had read the reviews about the update being a completely new app overhaul that was nothing like the original application bought and I was pretty sad about it. I made sure not to update the app so that I could keep the old BoxVR that I love and somehow, the app has automatically updated to the new FitVR! I am so freaking unhappy, sad, and frankly, pissed about this!!\n\nI have been excited to show my family this app for months because I knew they would absolutely love it and was waiting until the COVID situation died down to show them but this complete overhaul and bait and switch of an app is not it! I am not excited to show them this at all!!\n\nI used to be able to do multiple sessions for up to an hour in BoxVR and I played an 8 min session in the new FitVR and have a legitimate headache now! Halfway through it, my eyes were already starting to hurt because of the dark background and ridiculously bright contrasting colors on everything else in there.\nI dont care for the new futuristic-esque environment that they were going for, and I am a millennial. I loved the gym look and feeling when going to the home page in BoxVR and being able to select gym-like environments because it felt more authentic. I felt like I was actually getting some good and realistic boxing practice in. If I wanted the futuristic one, I could choose that too. But this new environment in FitVR is BS and a literal pain and headache to experience.\n\nThe new targets look sad compared to the past version (they must have spent all their time on the graphics everywhere else) and the extra firework-like effects every time you hit a target is distracting for me and makes the light headache even worse.\n\nI could care less about the supposed group sessions and theyre just floating heads and hands you have to make a real effort to see and I didnt find it motivating in the slightest. But maybe thats just me.\n\nThe gloves are gone and its just another take away from the boxing aspect. I want to feel like Im BOXING, not just swinging my glowing hands at some sad, floating mushrooms -_-\n\nThe FitPoints or whatever they are called are arbitrary and not helpful to me at all. How are they even calculated?? What happened to my hit and miss stats on each punch/block variation?!!? That was so much more helpful and motivating than this stupid point system and however the hell the system counts your streaks! The streaks are ridiculously demotivating because it is hard to maintain and not really helpful in terms of accuracy, consistency, or technique. I didnt even want to finish the 8 minute session 4 minutes in because I was already frustrated.\n\nThere are wayyyyy less sessions than there used to be. Like legitimately half or even less than what there used to be and the music and motivation aspect of them just arent the same. And what happened to my customized playlists?!? Theyre all gone! I had a steady routine I had made and with the loss of my playlists, that is all gone!!\n\nThis update = complete overhaul is absolute bulls**t. I am so incredibly disappointed and sad honestly, that my favorite workout app for VR has been ruined and the excitement that I used to have to play and get a good workout in is completely gone. Even looking at the app on my home screen makes me upset now.\n\nAnd what is worse is that I tried to avoid it and yet the update forced itself through and I lost all my playlists and all my faith in this app and developer.\nI honestly want a refund. This is NOT the app I bought! It is 100% different in all aspects and is a complete bait and switch! This update should have been a completely separate application!!\n\nDEVELOPERS!!! You either need to make this right and offer refunds or add in a retro version of the old app for those of us who paid for BoxVR NOT FitVR!!\n\nAnd if that does not happen, I will request a full refund because this is not the app I paid for and this was not your team listening to what your customers wanted.

A beta test version might have saved you some trouble.\n\nYou all had such a high rating on this app and I hope you see how this update has been received by the majority of your consumers and MAKE IT RIGHT!\n\nIncredibly disappointing and Im sad to have lost such a good game to this BS that is now FitVR.\n\nHelpful | 16\nDeveloper Response18 days ago\n\nWere so sorry to hear youre disappointed and missing some of the features that were previously available for BoxVR.

Overall it's fun. Recently tho, they completely overhauled the game and other than the core gameplay, it no longer resembles what I payed originally payed for.\n\n-First off, you need to give your email to create a FitXR account. Why?\n-There is multiplayer but it's not real/live. I found out when I had to pause the game once and everything and everyone froze until I unpaused.\n-Hit detection feels worse.\n-You can't change the stage.\n-Time is moved to the edge of the peripheral making it hard to see mid game.\n-No more in game calorie counter\n-No more custom playlists\n-The flashing rings on good hits get annoying on longer sessions or when there are big clusters of beats\n-They changed the categorization of the songs and it's really not intuitive. (It used to be sorted by length now it's just random until you set filters)\n-Worse thing for me is they changed the scoring system. If you don't hit a beat hard enough it breaks your combo, which no other rhythm game ever does. You have to really hit hard to maintain combo and for someone who's not that fit it's really demotivating to have a perfectly reasonable hit when you start to get tired and have it not count. This maybe why hit detection feel worse since every punch I'm focusing on speed and sacrifice accuracy\n\nOverall it feels like one of those Facebook or YouTube pages that got sold off and is just trying to be cool\n\nEdit: hit detection is definitely worse, I saw my hand go straight thru a note multiple times and it didn't count\n\nEdit 2: after accepting the offer to revert back to BoxVR I must admit that overall, FitXR is a step in the right direction, despite the terrible launch strategy, and changing of the combo counter.

Especially the diagonally below balls are very strange and very difficult to hit 'hard'.\n\nThere is now a change from correctly hitting to hard hitting I guess but it's very frustrating if you hit a ball with big explosions effects and light ring and get zero strain because you did not do the perfect hard hitting - which is sometimes impossible because of rapid changes of movements.\nThere could be an choosing option between old and new system.\n\nIn the custom menue I did not find any logout button.\n\n\n\nEdit 23-08-20\nAfter the update the play flow is much better, it is really fun again !\n\nI like the random multiplayer-function, but it would be nice to invite my real friends.

I played box vr just about everyday in which I could get a perfect on almost every workout. Now you care more about speed an accuracy really in what fitness world have you ever belonged to where speed is more important than form. But I can adjust and change to that. YOU KILLED THE ACCURACY! hooks and upper cuts barely work. There is no longer a reward for a higher streak, there is no punishment for missing which is good because I now end up missing 50 or more hooks and uppercuts because you guessed the accuracy sucks. LAG is an issue, why should someone else connection effect my game play I can tell it does sine the ball explodes behind me half of the time. You can no longer adjust where the hit point is on the glove so now I don't know where to punch. So in essence you turned the game into the person who can fail their arms the fastest will get the best workout. punching faster doesn't give you a better workout, it just makes your arms tired.\n\nHelpful | 14", "magic_snjor19 days ago\nNot what I paid for.\n\nI had bought BOXVR and very much miss it.

In many ways it's even an improvement, but in some ways it isn't.\n\nOn the Plus side:\n- Improved statistics.\n- Filters to select your workout\n- Focus on speed, resulting in far more intense workouts. In Box I could easily do 30 focused minutes, but Fit has me gasping for air within 10.\n- Better multi-player experience. Even though the \"opponents\" are very probably not actually boxing with you at the same time (probably the last 6 that did that workout), it beats the previous experience of having to wait around for minutes to finally have an opponent show up.\n\nOn the Minus side:\n- This is a big one. The \"special effects\" of exploding balls with the 'explosive ring' gets in the way of your workout. It obstructs your view. There should be an option to significantly tone it down or remove entirely. (HIGH PRIORITY)\n- The streak now only measures \"explosive hits\" instead of all hits. This way I'll never beat my Box records of over 1200 consecutive hits.\n- Some extra sceneries (e.g. Traditional urban gym) would be nice, but I'm guessing those are on the product roadmap, but not crucial for launch.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Arcaia3 days ago\nUsed to be a 5 star\n\nPlease, you guys / gals, do something about the streaks.

Is it to get a high score, be fast, get impossible streaks, punch hard, stay in as long as you can until frustration? I mean seriously.

Graphics look slightly better in some areas. It looks more like a proper fitness studios app. A few of the mechanics have been changed from earlier versions to make it easier to hit hooks and uppercuts. Ive yet to go through all the workouts to say if they are better.\n\nWhat really bugs me is that as a real boxer, I get dinged for proper techniques and hits and rewarded if I swing like Im playing Beat Saber.\n\nThe streak counter is NOT a streak counter. Its an EXPLOSIVE streak counter. Not that I would keep that in mind when its one of the two main status indicators during the game. Its pretty disheartening to look up occasionally and see my streak continually going back to zero when I havent missed anything.\n\nI get the idea of encouraging you to hit faster and harder. It also doesnt make sense when you are boxing and there is a sequence of 3 jabs and a cross. You load up on the cross and take measured jabs. Instead I have to take full swings for the jabs and take the bad form to keep the streak.\n\nI found that I can always get the uppercut if I just slap upwards instead of cutting upwards with good form. I dont think you should be rewarded only if you are trying to do a street fighter RYU style flying uppercut. When I hit your chin, I pull back and reset. I dont swing through EVERYTIME.\n\nI get it. This is a game. There are no techniques being taught. You arent expected to be a boxer. Still, if I wanted to swing fast and wild like in beat saber, I would just play beat saber.\n\nTake the scoring off completely then. What is the point of leaderboards and record keeping if I can game the score.\n\nAm I sweating? Of course, there is no disputing that. Just dont make me think Im doing something wrong when my counter constantly resets to zero when I hit everything.\n\nSimple fix guys. You had a lead-up to the launch. Play and UI testing should have brought some attention to this instead of waiting for EVERY review to be pointing out the same problem.\n\nHelpful | 7", "carrie.howell25 days ago\nBoxVR changed into FITxr... why!?!\n\nLet me start by saying that I LOVED boxvr. It had some issues and could definitely use certain changes, but I played it every single day for months. It's been a huge part of my weight loss journey. I don't understand why they had to change everything so much.\n\nPositives: It's harder to maintain a streak than previously which makes it a sweatier workout. There are still some great songs.\n\nNegatives: You can't pick the environment. I personally liked the real-look gym in boxvr because it didn't give me a headache like the new one with the darkness and neon lights. You can't put in personalized stats like weight and height so the calorie count is ridiculously inaccurate. You're supposed to be able to box with other players but every time I did the others would stop tallying or moving about halfway through. You can't select songs and make custom playlists like before and the whole screen selection page for the classes isn't as well organized as before.\n\nI was hoping that with boxvr they would do an update where you could scroll through and pick songs one at a time (like DDR) instead of having to make a playlist. I didn't expect them to just get rid of that altogether.\n\nOverall this new update is disappointing to say the least. If the game had been like this initially I probably never would have bought it.

They took away a ton of content and didn't add that much. The new version has promise and I'm sure they'll add more content (hopefully not in the format of paid DLC's only) but as of right now we lost a lot more than we gained. Should have been a newly released app not an \"update.\" BoxVR was pretty great. This isn't as good. Feel like I'm getting ripped off.\n\nThe Good:\n- The social/group dynamic is nice. Competing against others for high score adds extra motivation.\n- The hit speed gauge is a nice feature. Let's you know how hard you're hitting the targets.\n- Ability to turn set squats on or off per class\n\nThe Bad:\n- Removal of custom playlists. This is my biggest complaint. I had songs that I liked. There was also a much greater variety than what there is now. So much good content was taken away. I don't like being forced to choose a pre-built \"class\". Custom playlists let me setup different lengths of workouts that I wanted.\n- There's now only one environment for playing. Used to have a few to pick from which was nice.\n- New streak goals only count when making extra-strong hits. You can hit all the targets but if just one isn't an extra-hard hit, it resets your streak. Streak shouldn't reset with a missed extra-hard hit but only for a missed hit. Hitting a target but being just under it counting as an extra hard hit is very frustrating and makes me not want to play. Wish I could just turn that feature off if that's how it's going to be.\n\nWhat Could Make I Better:\n- Bring back custom playlists.\n- Ability to toggle streak counter on/off or makes it so that it doesn't just track extra hard hits only\n- Add more than one boxing environment\n- Add option to bring boxing gloves back\n\nUsed to be five stars -- now only three :-(\n\nHelpful | 6", "Darksteele18 days ago\nNever seen such a change before\n\nEdit to three stars: I gave FitXR two more chances and it still bothers me, how it replaced BoxVR.

When you try to really punch like boxing, the hits will often miss, losing streaks, which is kinda weird and taking away the fun of the game. So one point down for this.\n\nComplete new review.... BoxVR to FitXR\nFirst of all, I'm loving the new look, layout, colors, setting, classes, motivation talk...... It feels more like a game that fits the Oculus quest. Environnement reminds me alot of my own real gym..... Dark, clean futuristic looks. Love it.\nStep into the future of a gym in VR.\nThe hits of the punches are way better and without the gloves it also looks more realistic. Classes are still fun, plenty to choose from. And I really love the option of being solo or in group. In group it's more of a dynamic and fun to get the highest points of the class.\nAlso the motivation from the coaches in between is a definite bonus. It keeps you going.\nThe overview is also way better (month/week/day). And good to have the option to add a friends account to the app.\n\nOne negative, and probably just a bug that needs a fix.... But the streak count doesn't work. I'm getting points and hits are registered but the streaks always go back to zero without there being a miss......\n\nBut for now, this update gets a big 5* from my side. Good job devs!

Especially when I've purchased one of the expansion packs, don't hold my purchase hostage. I should be able to use it whenever I want.\n\n\nPreviously a heavy user of BoxVR on Rift. The update to FItVR is appreciated in a lot of ways, but it still needs a few tweaks to get to 5 stars. 1) I purchased one of the expansion packs, and it is extremely confusing once the purchase is made. There is zero visual indication of how youre supposed to access the additional workouts, or which workouts are included in the pack. 2) The streaks now rely on punching with a certain amount of power, but the threshold to achieve a power-punch is inconsistent and too high. It works even less reliably on uppercuts and hooks. To have any hope at keeping a streak going, you have to punch so hard that it feels like you might injure yourself 3) The timing on uppercuts and hooks (especially uppercuts) is off somehow. Hard to explain, but often an uppercut seems to explode with a delay after its already passed slightly out of view instead of in front of you.\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper Response15 days ago\n\nThank you for taking the time to review FitXR and were so sorry to hear youre unhappy with the update. Just so youre aware, youll only need to be online the first time you complete a workout and after this point, it will download so youre able to play offline. Weve done this so we can ensure each workout is downloaded fully and doesnt cause issues with offline play in the future. Id also really like to thank you for your feedback and please be reassured that this has all been logged and passed over to the team.

In the meantime however, youll be able to find the workouts from your DLC packs in the main workout section on the right hand side. Apologies that this isnt the most convenient option in the meantime! With the new explosive streaks, you'll need to accurately hit a jab or cross at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S. Wed also like to apologise that you're experiencing a delay when hitting the hooks or uppercuts. One thing that we do recommend is making sure your controllers are a little closer to your lenses as having your arms down and lifting them suddenly can cause tracking issues.", "sinod18 days ago\nBoxVR was great! FitXR broke the game.\n\nIm heartbroken!! BoxVR was by far my favorite app on Quest. Im giving this three stars solely because I loved the previous version, perhaps hoping that well get the option of downgrading back to BoxVR.

Consequently I was excited about the latest update to FitXR, looking forward to an even better experience  a broader playlist, compelling add-on packs, well developed environments, and fewer bugs. However, that just isnt the case. Ive been playing FitXR since the transition last week, hoping each time that it would somehow get better. Adding to the list of complaints already shared by other users, Ive found this update to be a letdown, degrading many facets of the experience. From the distracting freezes in multiplayer mode, the unrealistic caloric burn count, to the laggy (too often unresponsive) controllers, my once favorite app is becoming increasingly unusable.

I actually looked forward to doing exercise for the first time in my life. After an hour of BoxVR I would be tired, but would keep playing, just for fun. Surprise, I open my oculus, and BoxVR is gone, replaced with something new... FitXR, or the VR version of New Coke, for those of you old enough to remember that debacle.\n\nFitXR has taken the joy out of my workouts, now I am watching the clock, just waiting for this garbage show to finish. I will keep using it, because it is a good work out, but I would really appreciate some sort of access to the game that I actually purchased. This game has too much visual stimulation, with clocks, power bars, levels, explosions, scoreboards, lined pathway where the ugly mushroom shaped things fly at you... Its overkill and completely ruins the minimalist asthetic that I think so many of the people loved about BoxVR.\n\nPlease offer the original version to those who have paid for it.

On the original game I could easily have a hit streak of 300+ but after playing this on and off for 3 days the longest streak I had was 10! To get qualified as a hit it looks like not only do you have to hit it in the glowing part of the orb but also hit with enough speed to to create the glowing ring......which is another issue.

You can't even customise the colours coming at you for better contrast...really dissapointed with the interface.\nThe merchanics are a big concerning also. The app encourages you to punch as fast as you can to increase your score. This has you whipping your arms around like crazy.

Are you kidding? Don't mislead people who a) don't know any better and b) don't have something like an apple watch that's tracking calories more accurately. I burned 200 during the workout, not 475. Use any calorie calculator for boxing - actual boxing against someone, and 16mins will show around 180 calories for someone my height age and weight. Where do you come up with 475. We're stand on the spot occasionally doing a squat if the workout has them and otherwise punching thin air. It's a good workout don't get me wrong and great for a rainy day or otherwise but don't fool people into thinking they're burning more than they are.\n\nOh and if you're doing an update don't wipe people's stats.

For any cues you hit accurately these are converted into FitXR points which will change where you're at on the leaderboard and allow you to level up throughout the workout. The streaks that are calculated individually are now called 'explosive streaks' and to get these you'll need to get multiple explosive punches in a row. To get an explosive punch, you'll need to accurately hit a jab or cross at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S. Since the update, we have also received a lot of feedback about these punches and how demotivating it is to lose a streak, so we are in discussions about ways we can improve this feature to keep our community motivated whilst still working hard.

The interface looks slicker but theres much less content, so its hard to see this as an improvement when players get less of a game.\n\nThe developers have removed custom environments and custom playlists. This was the main reason I purchased the game in the first place, being able to build your own workouts, choosing the music and intensity level kept the game fun on a daily basis. Some of the music is just terrible and there are now only a handful of intensive workouts to choose from so it gets boring very quickly.\n\nI find it hard to believe that the new features are actually things players requested. Yes the new interface is better and its nice to be able to filter and favourite workouts these are genuine improvements. But making players create an account and forcing them to play in online mode, before we can access a game that we bought without these restrictions is not cool at all. Also the new explosions when punching and the voiceover are just cheesy and annoying. Please at least let players turn these features off if they want to, theyre distracting.\n\nI really hope that the developers listen to their players and bring back some of the features that have been removed in the next update. There have been a lot of negative reviews since the game updated.\n\nI really dont recommend purchasing this game anymore, theres not enough content to keep it fun and engaging and there are just far better boxing and rhythm games out there that are worth spending money on.\n\nHelpful | 11\nDeveloper Response22 days ago\n\nThank you for taking the time to review FitXR and were sorry to hear youre unhappy with the update, especially with the removal of the custom workouts.

Expect to put in 30+ mins to feel it once used to the game; Possibly 15 if your are going at all your punches hard. For me it works great for warmup/cool down or days you want to take it a bit easier but still get in exercise. This of course depends on your own fitness level. In my opinion its the perfect way to start getting back into shape if you have been away from it for awhile or just getting started without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nSpace Required: Minimal, you face one direction and don't need to lunge or move from where you are making it perfect for those tight on space.\n\nBiggest Gripe: In BoxVR, you were able to adjust the hand position in relation to the glove(hitbox) this made it so if you felt your hits were not connecting you could adjust the position of the gloves to better match your actual punches. This feature seems to be removed from the new FitXR and I am missing many hits that I think should connecting. This can be a huge distracting when playing because I find myself thinking about when to swing so it registers with the game rather than being emmersed into the experience. Other games like Supernatural and Beat Saber overcomes this obstacle by giving you a bat/saber which has a very large hitbox area so you are less likely to feel cheated. I would suggest bringing back the adjustment option on top of increasing a invisible hitbox area around the gloves or targets. I understand a concern may be that people with previous scores may feel a bit cheated when people beat their scores with easier hitboxes or to large of an increase would feel you are being rewarded for misses, it is about finding a happy balance that I think FitXR could benefit from and would make the exerperience much more enjoyable. With that said it's not terrible maybe even improved over the default hand glove position from the past just takes some getting used to.\n\n2nd Gripe: This one is more minor to me but as others have stated, it would have been nice if they kept the old environments and just added to that instead of removing the old content.\n\nKnit Picking 1: Some tracks have to many repeated sections that go on far to long, for example straight punch, dodge right, straight punch dodge right. Over and over till the point, where I'm like alright geez give me something new, it is often followed up by a repeated reverse section later in the song but does get a bit irritating usually happens with instrumentals.\n\nKnit Picking 2: Voice Encouragment, its a decent addition but lacks a bit of energy and excitement in the voices, be better if they sounded like they were doing the workout with you.\n\nKnit Picking 3: Multi-player is a bit misleading as it is recorded ghosts, I still like it but woukd be nice to have the option to wait in a queue and actually play live with others, maybe even have the ghosts in there as well to fill the rest of the room after queue time expires after first live person joins with a different name color for live players. Would be hard to have enough live players doing all the songs all the time as you start so my suggestion would be you select a intensity level then it does it by single song and you can continue or quit out as you go, that way the longest you wait is one song.\n\nKnit Picking 4: Calories are way off but thats expected without a heart rate monitor, Even though its way off, I still find it good motivation.\n\nI do really like the addition of how fast your punches are. It's not perfect for example you can get it to go to 8.2 max with an intentionally slower punch then clearly punch faster but it won't budge but, its still a good motivator and welcomed addition.\n\nSuggestion for Devs: Add in outward and downward hits to bring more variety to the game.\n\nVerdict: Overall a good experience with room to improve.\n\nHelpful | 0", "StrutZ7613 days ago\nAlmost There...\n\nFirst off let me say overall I love most of the updates from BoxVR to FitXR. The punching power meter and calculations seem to be much better. Updated look is clean. Great app overall!\n\nBUT!!! My favorite part of BoxVR was being able to host a private class with my mom who lives out of state. Great way for ous to start our mornings and have some competitive fun. At first I thought this functionality was hidden behind a new menu but was astonished to find out you guys scrapped live multiplayer in favor of some ghost saved sessions from other other users. Really??!! Whoever thought this was a good move needs to be counseled. I am praying this was a temp fix due to network syncing or something because this is a MAJOR step back.

I can see where others are coming from, but to me it is clear that things are taking off in a whole new, better direction with the overhaul.\n\nI use my Oculus Quest almost entirely for working out, and this is a game changer. The punch speed meter and the need to put more effort in to the punches continuously to get streaks means I am now seeing a calorie burn rate that matches Thrill of the Fight (I monitor my calories with an app and a heart rate monitor) - but it can also be used for lighter workouts by dropping the intensity, or by not going for the streaks. It is really good for HIIT as you can go for the streaks for short stretches, and combine this with lighter punches so you are not over-doing it. Of course there are still squats, lunges and blocks, but now as the punches cry out for so much more effort, the workout is a lot more whole body than before.\n\nYes, I want to see options to change things such as graphical effects (although I actually prefer the changes and effects), an accurate calorie counter (although most of us with the fitness bug have got other means for this), more environments, better multi-player support with bug fixes, more social interaction possibilities, and heck dare I say, an optional realistically priced subscription model that provides regular updated content, live coaching sessions etc would fit well for this type of game.\n\nIt was a brave move to change the game so much, and yes for the nostalgic amongst us, a classic BoxVR option would be an idea, and might certainly resolve the complaints that I can see from some about the change - but I certainly would not want to go back.\n\nFitXR devs - take note from the negative reviews as most of them do have valid points, but please don't reverse what you are doing, as I can see a good thing that will get so much better!\n\nHelpful | 3", "mysteryfox91824 days ago\nMissing BoxVR\n\nHave to agree with other players, I am missing the environments of BoxVR so much.

A few cons: The calorie counter in not visible during the exercise and even when visible Im not sure how its calculated and I miss having multiple scenes for the exercise.\n\nThat being said - this new version has grown on me and Im still very happy with the workout I get from this app*******\n\n\n\nI was initially thrilled to see there was an update to BoxVr. I use it daily as part of my workout routine and even though it was relatively simple from a graphics standpoint, it was easy to use, had good variety in workouts and songs and overall a great fitness app for the Quest. I was hoping an update would bring things such as additional locations, or ability to customize the workout a bit more. Instead, it was a complete overhaul of the game, making BoxVr almost unrecognizable. I was ok with this until starting the workout...I couldnt get a streak above single digits. The ducks/dodges are almost impossible (I am 52) and the hooks/uppercuts response must be off bc I hit them the same\nWay I do DAILY in BoxVr but they dont register and Im back down to 0 which is frustrating. There isnt an option to calibrate height so this will probably continue to be a point of frustration. I just wish this update had been a blend of what existed with some new exciting features.

I'm not sure if it's just me because I seem to be the only one mentioning it in the reviews, but I have to strike with pretty much all my might to get them to appear. I even injured myself doing it, nothing serious I just couldn't play the game for a week.

Unfortunately with the upgrades my choice to customize my workout went away. It would be nice to be able to customize the background setting to break up the monotony and adjust to my mood. While the developers were going for a class effect it falls very short of that. The background feels like I'm walking up to weigh in on the biggest loser. As for the part were you're supposedly competing with other people this falls extremely short as well. I could care less about robot figures with irrelevant numbers. If you want a class feel give some options of different backgrounds. Instead of robots, actually make people in the classroom or at least the instructor that made the workout. Another huge disappointment is there aren't as many workouts to choose from as before and you can't pick songs to make up your own playlist. The fitnessXR points are annoying. The percentage of jabs, hooks, squats etc at the end of the workout helps me know what to work on and improve my boxing.

No Connection Drop when Music Change. Perfect.\n\n- Serie/Strike works better but not perfect.\nSometimes Counter is set to Zero and I don't know why. The Problem accurs when hitting Target from the Side sometimes from button. I can see, that 1-2 Player in a Session can make big Series. I Think thy are PC Players with Steam and external TrackerStations? I don't know?\n\nSo I give now 4 Stars instead of 2.

Constantly and without any recognizable connection, the series is constantly reset. The points are counted for the hit but still the series is set to 0. This happens constantly in every game.\n\nImprovements:\n\n1) Training selection\n\nUnfortunately it is not possible to see which training has already been played. This is really cumbersome. A display under the training would be very helpful.\n\n2)Multiplayer\n\nThere should also be a possibility to play against your friends from the friends list.\n\nBesides, FitXR crashed the first time after about 1 hour.

A bit samey with regards to what you have to do, although it does mix it up and you can vary the intensity and the length of exercise. Overall though, aside from not being a fan of the music, this is brilliant assuming you stick to it.\nI've been on, on average twice a day for a good 20 minutes per session. First time, i was aching the next day.

I'll be fair and will update my review as the product continues to return to greatness.\n\nUPDATE 9 August 2020 - Dropping another star after losing the 6-8 classes I had added to Favorites which are now erased. Am attempt to save a new favorite had the same result. Saved, but was gone upon re-launch of the app. Adding to the issue is the inability to add a class to favorites directly, without having to run through and complete the class before being presented with the option to add as a favorite.\n\nI suggest leveraging a pool of beta testers before publishing buggy updates! Right now this is, at best, a beta release, and beta testers are usually volunteers ...not paying customers!\n\nThe recently upgraded FitXR (formerly BoxVR which I rated 5 stars) has much improved graphical interface, but I'm revising my review for this new version, and dropping my resting down to two stars.\n\nHere is why.\n\nI love the added information provided as well as the vastly improved location (visible without needing to glance to the side of take your vision off of the oncoming targets).\n\nUnfortunately that is where my love turns to frustration.\n\nThe lists of classes has no thought to organisation. There is no progression of classes by length. The only way to narrow down by length is to apply a filter, except the filters are not labeled with the range of time but rather \"short\", \"medium\", and \"long\". A range of times would be that here. Is a 12 or 14 minute workout in with short, or medium? ...and why not sort them all out by length? The view of all classes are scattered with no logic that I have determined.\n\nI missed the announcement where all of my stats from BoxVR would not be migrated to this new app.\n\nThere is no longer the ability to create a workout using a custom song list.\n\nLet's talk multiplayer. While it is cool to see my class get populated with up to six additional contestants, there is a question as to if these are live people, playing along in real time. I and many others have noticed that they all stop participating after a few minutes. This takes my name on the board from 3rd place, magically to 1st place! A victory over simulated or pre-recorded contestants is a hollow victory. One of my friends looked over and saw that she was boxing along side of her own user ID!\n\nWe miss the ability to start multiplayer games, and invite our friends to join us. Gone is the option for this.\n\nNow on to how Peak hits are counted. This is my major point of contention. I can get every oncoming target, but if I don't strike it as a power hit (with the ring) it doesn't count and resets the peak hit counter? Why the change to this?\n\nWhy not count a player's ability to hit the targets, and reset when one is missed. Let power hits count toward faster advancement to higher levels!\n\nHow about favorites? I see that there is a place for them, but how/where can favorites be added?\n\nHere is a recap / wishlist;\nI love the redesign, but it falls short in other areas.\n\nOn the streak count let it count every 'strike' and reset it back to zero on misses.\n\nLet the 'power strikes' be bonus hits that either accelerate ascending levels, or count toward advancing to higher levels.\n\nDefault sort classes no matter the filter applied should be by length of the class.\n\nAn indicator on the thumbnail of each class indicating of it has been played, and most recent score would also be welcome.\n\nFinally, ditch the bots. If you aren't competing against living people in real-time, any victories are hollow victories.\n\n\n~ Reviewed for the previous 5 star version ~\n\nSo fun that I forget that I'm exercising!\n\nI am working to get Box VR into my regular morning routine, and working my way up in both speed and duration.\n\nThis game will get your body moving, your heart pumping, and get you sweaty!\n\nYour muscles will 'feel' this!\n\nPricy, but totally worth it!

Please be reassured that our team is investigating this and wed love for you to email us at support@fitxr.com so were able to keep you updated with our progress. With the menu, youre completely right that we need to create a better way to differentiate between workouts and our team is working on improving this screen. With the times, Short classes are <10 mins, Medium are 10 to 19 mins and Long classes are 20 mins+. For multiplayer currently with FitXR, you are able to compete against six other players who have previously completed that same workout. We were aware of the issue with the other players in the game and scoreboard, and we have now released a fix for this, We do also completely understand that community is a huge motivator and will be continuing to enhance the multiplayer functions over the upcoming weeks and months. This will include the ability to play with friends, introducing multiplayer challenges, and so much more. With the streaks, so we can work to give you the best workout possible, we've changed the way they are calculated with FItXR. For any cues you hit accurately these are converted into FitXR points which will change where you're at on the leaderboard and allow you to level up throughout the workout. The streaks that are calculated individually are now called 'explosive streaks' and to get these you'll need to get multiple explosive punches in a row. To get an explosive punch, you'll need to accurately hit a jab or cross at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S. Since the update, we have received a lot of feedback about these punches and how demotivating it is to lose a streak, so we are in discussions about ways we can improve this feature to keep our community motivated whilst still working hard. I also just wanted to mention that although we will be constantly updating FitXR and taking all of this valuable feedback on board, we would be more than happy to give you access back to BoxVR if you would like.

Its no longer the game I bought here and on psvr.\n\nMeasuring the power of punches is good, the tracking sometimes lets that down. Im not really interested in the multiplayer aspect that is now included in the sense of score comparisons. One environment, with no choice to go back to the studios. Thats one of the bigger mistakes imv.\n\nIt now feels more like a computer game than the exercise app it originally was. Ill still use it, but slightly more reluctantly and will look around my library more often for alternatives. Ill also think twice about buying software from the studio next time purely on the basis of wholesale changes (most in my view, not needed). Sorry devs.\n\nIn short this was a 4.5 star app, near perfect. Its now, at best, a 4. It losses a star due to the total overhaul to software people had already purchased.

I am pretty disappointed. Box VR let me put together a custom work out based on songs that I choose. There are some pretty cool songs but I find most of them to be like some generic 2nd string pop music. So Fit XR removes the ability to create a playlist out of the songs they have. Now with FitXR you have to play using their premade work outs and listen to their playlist. Again I remind you that there are a lot of garbage songs in this game. This was where it was nice to play with all the songs that dont suck.\n\nAll in all, the changes made switch this game from being customary and a way to enjoy exercising to a dystopian communist training simulation.

You just need to use Link or even better: Virtual Desktop and still play cordlessly. Hopefully this will continue to be the case, as this update makes it feel like I now have two games for the price of one. I can use FitXR for the pre-made workouts and BoxVR for my own music.\n\nThe new visuals fix one of my issues of the old one- BoxVR looked more like a tech demo, now it looks like a proper VR game.\nAlso improved: you can now filter lessons by music and by intensity making it easier to choose a workout (previously the only filter was length).\n\nThe intensity meter during gameplay and the new hit streak system encourage you to work harder. Previously it wasn't hard to get a 300+ streak. Now you need to hit hard for the streak to count making it more of a challenge.\n\nI do hope that they add a few more environments in future updates and that they had allowed those with playlists made to import them into the new game. This wasn't an issue for me, but if they do the same thing to the PC version I'll be pi**Ed off as it takes ages to import your own music to the game. So if that update happens I hope they won't delete our uploaded music.\n\nFinally, if they want 5 stars from me they'll need to have the option to turn off the instructors voice.

If you didn't experience BoxVR you won't know what you never experienced, however, I'm sure at some point you will want what was in BoxVR... to be fair, you'll still get a workout.\n\nCouple thoughts on the \"upgrade\" from BOX VR which I bought a week prior to the forced update.\n\n- I like the hit meter. Helps motivation wise.\n- Would like more environments including more realistic, less arcade like rooms like what was in BOX VR. airy roomy well lit gym.\n- seems like there are less free workouts to choose from then what was available in BOX VR? why?\n- custom workouts is gone. Why? and if this is was rebuilt on an entirely new platform, will it be added back in? If so when? If not, that's what original BOX VR owners paid for\n- I don't mind that the gloves were taken away, but it would be nice to have the option to have gloves on or off, and calibrate the gloves. For me this isn't a deal breaker, but calibrating might be helpful depending how people hold their controllers.\n- Thought multi-player was truly multi-player and I can invite my friend, etc... Doesn't appear that's the case? I haven't tinkered with this that much yet.\n- I've heard issues registering hits, seems like it is ok on my end with the couple workouts I did, but I need to play for...\n\nOverall, IMHO upgrades are supposed to be additive, and address bugs, performance issues, etc. not remove features.\n\nI'll get a workout, but those who purchased Box VR lost more then they gained.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper Response18 days ago\n\nWere so sorry to hear youre disappointed and missing some of the features that were previously available for BoxVR.

So I've used the new platform a few times now and I'm not completely sold on it.\nI do like some of the changes. I think the multiplayer option is nice. To see others scores like you're in a class..sort of. I think it's a nice, clean change with the surroundings. However I did like the option of choosing your studio. In the previous layout, I would get entire classes with 100 percent accuracy with the streaks. This new one, it's much more difficult. Now, I am just getting used to it but if you dont punch as hard as you can and perfectly center, it's a no go and sends you right back to zero. My favorite class is Let's work because of the many, many punches, the fast pace and the music but with the new design it's a whe new ball game.. I am really hoping there are some bug fixes. I hit hard and on target and it doesnt count. Some just fly by although I hit them accurately. Of course it wont roll out and be perfect. And that's ok.

Such a lazy way to design an upgrade it reminds me of contractors. I'm in software development for over a decade and can tell that this was avoidable, both of them. Bumping off a couple stars for that, hoping they'll learn.\n\nOtherwise the app is great for workout, although can get boring after a while.

They'll tell you to buy more content though so that's somewhat warranted...\n\nThe exercises can get really intense but mostly focus on upper body. There are crouches and sidesteps, but mostly you punch the air in various ways and stabilize yourself after, so it does not do much for lower body.

Daylight robbery by the developer it would seem.\n\nYou can see under my OLD REVIEW, WHICH APPLIES TO BOX VR, NOT THIS NEW GAME\n\n\nBOX VR Is the app I spent most time with on the Quest, and one main reason I am happy to have it. I do get many work breaks and cramming one hour total in per day using time I would have mostly wasted is fantastic.\nMy wife, who is not particularly into VR, spends tons of time with it too (I bought initially for her, since she enjoys cardio kickboxing).\nI am not sure how exact the calories count is, but, if practised with good form and intensity, it is a very good aerobic exercise. I end up sweating profusely, feel better afterwards, action is intense enough not to feel the effort, mostly, which is the whole point.\nCompared to the various Beat Saber, ping pong, racket, wich are all no doubt entertaining, this is a way more effective exercising app, less of a game.\n\nThis for the positive, and honestly it sounds like a piece of advertising.\n\nNEUTRAL POINTS\nDetection is good. Most of times I feel that if I miss a target, it was because of bad form.\nHowever, occasionally I feel there is some problem.\nAlso, at times I am not sure how to score higher, which motivates me, it does not seem it correlates all the time with correct timing, speed of the punch and width of the swing, some additional info in game would be nice.\n\nNEGATIVE POINTS\nII do not expect concert level but many songs' lyrics are truly awful to the point of being distracting from the workout.\nIt would be good to be able to import songs and rate trainings so I remember what I liked.\n\nWorkout tracking:\nI like to track my workouts, write length of sessions, calories, frequency. Exercising entirely with a computer on my face and not having this done automatically is ridicolous!\nI would like at the very least an optional record of my sessions in calendar format with minutes/calories, ability to summarize by time period.

If you can't invite your friends to play with you, that's not really multiplayer, is it?

In BoxVR, the game didn't care about the speed of my hits, so just lifting the arm to tap the targets registered and I felt like I did my job. I used to spend some ~120 calories per workout (as measured by Garmin and BoxVR both, but neither counted the weights).\n\nWith FitXR, I do 350 calories per workout. Again, neither Garmin nor FitXR take my wrist weights into account, so it's probably closer to 400 plus a good shoulder workout.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I like this change because it makes my workouts more intense in the way I want them to be more intense.\n\nThat said, there's lots to dislike: only one gym, multiplayer is iffy (all players disconnect sometimes so you're left alone which is great for your leaderboard but not very competitive), there are no progress or completion indicators on the classes so you don't know which ones you've already done, there's no customization, in general it's much more on-rails and rigid, you get your hand held, whereas BoxVR was more a sandboxy thing.

There are a few minor complaints I have like with the whole system now being based around power over accuracy is kind of annoying because the workouts can get kind of tiring after a short time and it makes it kind of difficult to hit those quick combos that come at you while playing but maybe in a future update we could see a feature to choose between wanting to do a power focused workout or just a regular workout like the old Boxvr.

Honestly, if you kept the old game and added a multiplayer option it would have been perfect. I get that you guys are wanting to constantly make improvements and bring in revenue on something you have worked countless hours on and I can respect that, but this new version still needs a lot of work.\n\nIssues:\n\n1. I have no idea what the \"streak\" counter is tracking.\n--- I was trying to get high scores in the multiplayer. Regardless of how hard I punched, how I positioned my fists, how accurately I punched, or how fast I was the counter would only move up when I did the squats and move back to zero when I punched.\n\n2. Not enough time to grab water.\n--- I haven't played many of the longer songs in the new version yet, but the old version had longer periods of rest time between their songs so you had time to open up a water bottle, take a good swig, set it back down, and get back into place before you had to throw your next punch. I don't even take of my headset when I grab water sitting right beside of me. It may not seem like a big deal, but I went in for some water right after a stance change/end of song (where there would normally be a break) and the break happened so fast that I missed like 3 punches and spilled water all over my desk trying to set it down to get back in the game. I'm not the fittest person, but I give it my all when I workout... So the slightly longer water breaks were appreciated.\n\n3. The targets and hand rings that replaced the gloves are ugly. (Sorry for the design critique)\n--- I don't understand the design change. The game is less visually pleasing to look at. I get that you are going for a more sci-fy feel, but I don't feel that this is it... The squat targets are very clunky. The targets looked very clean and sharp before and now crosses look like half deflated soccer balls and uppercuts look like mushrooms. The new design feels like a beta of the old game.\n\n\nPositives:\n\n1. Multiplayer has a lot of potential.\n--- I am a competitive person. I like that I can play against other people. Once the issues with the \"streak\" counter are worked out I think I will really enjoy it.\n\n2. The UI design of the leaderboard, personal score, time left, and punch speed has been well done.\n--- Those designs are clean and can be easily seen while playing. I really like having a bar at the bottom that lets me know how well I'm doing with each punch.\n\n3. You are actually listening to our feedback.\n--- I've noticed that the team has been actively responding to reviews and have even seen some changes to the game based on feedback from other reviews.

Overall it's great!\nBox VR was one of my staple exercise games. I'm blown away by the update. All of the graphics and UI have been fully overhauled, and it didn't cost me an additional dime!\nFrom what I can tell they incorporated in many quality of Life upgrades I'm sure players were asking for.\nFirst impressions of game play. The hit zones are improved and feel much more natural. They also put in a hit meter at the bottom middle to show how hard you hit the note and encourage you to really punch hard.\nMultiplayer. I didn't care. whatever. That said, seeing 6 people next to me swinging and a leader board with my name slated against the other people in the room really upped the game for me. I found myself focusing harder to get long combos to top the board :)\nOn a down side, I'm not sure how solid the multiplayer is. of the workouts I did just now only one seemed to work smoothly. The other two workouts (one with 1 other person and one with 6 other people) It seemed like they all got dropped out pretty quick and their scores stopped updating. I'm on a fairly solid 20MB connection.\n\nHelpful | 3", "mvoosten17 days ago\nSuch a shame\n\nSince the conversion from BoxVR to Fit XR the workouts are so lame.\nIntermediate and intense workouts are a joke.

No leader boards, no seeing what your previous score was on a class, no way to see if you have done a class previously without clicking on each class.

However I expect energetic songs that, even if I wouldn't listen to normally, make the session flow. The pap pop is low energy and some of the music is so bad it feels offensive, was a blessed relief to play silently with the volume down. Personally, I would play with your own music choice on headphones and the in game music volume down.\n\nAccurate tracking of controllers is a really tough task to get perfect, it works OK, but plenty of misses I felt I should have got, coupled with many successful hits which I had so obviously mistimed, spoil the immersion. Also, you seem to have to throw the punches in an exaggerated way to get consistent hits. Feels a bit odd.\n\nThe game play is in desperate need of customisation settings to tune it to a given players preferences. Perhaps these will come in time.\n\nThe workout feels good and is a far superior workout to other beat type games I have tried. The calorie counter values, and these are never accurate, is laughably high.\n\nI found the 'multi player' sessions a bit distracting, but I'm sure some will enjoy trying to keep high on the leader board.\n\nThe whole interface smacks of style over substance, it's a new version and maybe they will flesh it out, but for now I would not recommend.\n\nA real shame because it feels like there could be a 4 or 5 star game here.\n\nAlso, once you realise the uppercut and hook graphics look really phallic, it can't be unseen!!\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper ResponseA day ago\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to review FitXR and for passing over your feedback. We're going to be constantly updating the game with our communitys thoughts at the centre of this so please be reassured Ive gone ahead and passed all of your points over to the team. Were sorry to hear that the music in the game isnt currently of your taste. This is something we of course want to improve and expand on as it's such a big part of the game. Apologies that youve also had some tracking issues. Were going to be constantly working to smooth this out, but in the meantime Ive included some tips below to help with this in the meantime - Check to see if your headset and controllers are properly charged - Reset your guardian before playing and try to make sure there's enough room so you don't hit the guardian when aiming for the hooks - Make sure your lenses are clean and the room you're in isn't too light/dark. Natural sunlight tends to work better than superficial light. - Make sure your controllers aren't too far away from the lenses (as having your arms down or towards the left/right and lifting them suddenly can cause issues) - Disable hand tracking. With the calorie counter, we are aware that this is a bit off at this moment in time and were currently working with professional bodies to help improve this so were able to give our players a better estimate of calories burned. Thanks for your feedback too about multiplayer. We will be expanding the functionality here, but if you would rather play solo, you can check the Solo Mode box before playing and this will only enter yourself into the workout. I hope this helps cover your points and reassures you that we are taking all of the comments we receive on board. As we work to update and improve FitXR, we really hope we can really better your experience and make this the best fitness app we can for our community.", "njallain21 days ago\nSome good, some bad with the upgrade\n\nFirst off, so for it's the best workout app I've used on on the Quest. I'm old enough that I can't run every day, and it's good to have an alternate workout that focuses on upper body.\n\nWith the upgrade from BoxVR there's a lot of good:\n- turn off squats/dodges on any workout (I don't think they add a lot and they disrupt the flow of punching the heck out of things sometimes)\n- favoriting workouts (wanted this almost immediately)\n- search by songs, length, intensity (I'm not really a hip hop fan)\n- the combos only count when you're hitting with enough speed. This can be good and bad (if the hits are coming to fast, I can get enough speed to continue a combo streak)\n\nThe bad:\n- Lag, lag , lag. I occasionally got performance problems before, but way more now. They need to really reduce the frame drops. I suspect its the new fancy effects (which are overdone - I'd be fine if they just toned it down a lot)\n- After the upgrade I had to go through the tutorial again. Seriously, just give me a skip button.\n- Creating an account. This infuriated me. Creating an account for a game I paid for and had been using for a while for some social aspect that I will always have disabled? No thank you (yet I had no choice...again, for a game I already paid for and had been using!)\n- The calorie count is way out of wack. No I did not burn 1000 Calories in 26 minutes. In my 45-50 min workout my watch measure about 600ish which is probably close given the amount I flail around wildly. Pre-upgrade to FitXR the calorie count seemed a bit more realistic.\n\nSo, the only issue I really need them to fix is the performance (since I already had to deal with the tutorial and the account). Fixing the calorie would be good, but I'm fine measuring it without their help. It's still a great workout app for days where I can't do something else\n\nHelpful | 0", "Hamburger55524 days ago\nGood update\n\nI first didnt see the songs/classes but see them now.

It's a huge bummer that this is no longer my favorite Fitness game .\n\nFew example reasons:\n\n1. There is no longer a way to adjust the virtual hand positions to match your real-world grip on the controllers in the settings area. This causes virtual hands to be positioned at awkward angles. Seems like a small detail, however the game now feels less accurate at tracking hits. (Also less immersive)\n\n2. This is the first Oculus game that required me to give an email to play... That seems like cheap data grab move I would expect from a \"free-to-play\" game, that feels distasteful in this paid content. Also it looks like the addresses are being leaked/displayed to other players (lacking only the domain) during virtual group sessions....yikes.\n\n3. No longer having a variety in Virtual locations to choose from and overall less customization options... why?!\n\n\nDEVS: I really hope effort is put in to address recent feedback from myself & other users. Or maybe just allow the toggling of a \"retro mode\" to restore the functionality/code originally purchased to those who desire it. One way or another, please give me my awesome game back! :)\n\nHelpful | 2", "PrinceNutella25 days ago\nWorst update\n\nThe new update from BoxVr to FitVr may have prettier graphics but it takes away so many features. A main feature taken away was the custom playlist. I'm sorry but the music selection of this game is mediocre for boxing workouts and the only reason why I continued to use BoxVr was because I could make high intensity custom playlists of music that I enjoy and can workout to. I never enjoyed the classes because they weren't challenging enough and did not consistently play music I like. Bring back the custom playlist feature and then I'll comeback to FitVr. (Also allow us to purchase an add on that uploads mp3 files to be converted to custom tracks.

I find FitXR to provide a much, much more strenuous and effective workout than either of those.\n\nIts not perfect - Ive had several routines where the instructor doesnt speak, and also a few moderate classes have been more exhausting than the intense ones. But these are not, for me at least, concerns worth dropping a star from my score. I find the music entertaining in all genres, the variations of patterns enough to keep me on my toes, and have no trouble keeping streaks of 200+ each time out.\n\nMy biggest issue is that with a headset on I find it occasionally tricky to maintain proper form, and forget to pivot my rear foot/move my lower body - but that feels intrinsic to VR rather than FitXR. The fact that my punches actually connect with a target more than makes up for it, instead of basically being Guitar Hero for fists on the Moov/Switch.\n\nI am now loving my boxing, for 50+ minutes 4+ times a week, which I could rarely maintain motivation for before.\n\nHelpful | 0", "magicturkey21 days ago\nRushed Update\n\nI loved Box VR. I played it very often and helped me return to levels of fitness during Lockdown and rainy days.\n\nWhile Fit XR doesn't seem like a terrible update, it's the same basic game but with a more digital feel rather than a homeliness the previous version had where you would train in a gym setting.\n\nIt also seems like the developers have been forced to release the game before it's finished.\nFrom small bugs like the \"buttons\" staying in the \"hover\" (down) position even after you've moved off them. But also the interface seems to be designed by somebody that hasn't played the game.\nFor instance, I want to be able to go to the packs I've bought and select one of those directly.\n\nThe multiplayer effect is fun at first, until it stops working after the first track of any workout finishes. And it also is a let down when you realise that it's not live.\n\nThe game still makes me sweat, although, the faster ones where you can no longer see what's coming next are frustrating and make you want to quit for the day.\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response21 days ago\n\nThank you so much for your review and were sorry to hear that it feels like its been rushed!

However, while there's a lot of good stuff in the update, they have, all in all, ruined it.\n\nFirst up, the \"encouragement\" from the \"trainers\" is so artificial and divorced from the context that I'm in that it seriously degrades the experience. There's probably an option to switch it off, but I can't be bothered looking, because this isn't the most serious problem.\n\nSecondly, the change of scoring encourages me to do things that I don't think are safe. In BoxVR, I was cautious to avoid accidentally overextending my arms during punches. Why? Well if you're not punching anything, there's nothing stopping your motion, except your own tendons and joints. Pulling your punches is punishing on tendons, and letting your punch fly through until the joint stops wears the joints. I find myself putting more into it, and I'm worried I'll injure myself.\n\nBut the killer is my final issue. In all my time using BoxVR (and I was using it daily for a couple of months) I don't recall ever once punching my headset. But I played FitXR yesterday for the first time, and a right uppercut saw my whack myself so hard on the headset that it took a chunk out of my little finger. I played it again this morning and the same thing happened, and now I've got two holes scabbing over.\n\nYou could blame me, say I wasn't being careful, but I'm not the one that has changed -- the game is. The timing of the game, the beats you're supposed to be matching, that's leading me to wait until things are closer to me to hit them, and the encouragement to put extra power in means that when things go inevitably wrong, it hurts.\n\nHelpful | 7\nDeveloper Response24 days ago\n\nHi NiallTracey, I'm so sorry to hear you've hurt yourself.

FITVR gives me twice as many calories as I am earning based on same workouts as in BOXVR and also YUR FITNESS data which used to match in BOXVR, but is now half what is reported in FITVR. I used to love punching in perfect sync to the music beat, but this now seems hard and has taken much of the fun away. I am also missing a lot of punches that I easily hit in the past and I think that is because of exploding graphics with my punches that blind me to upcoming orbs as well as the decreased color contrast and size of the directional indicators that show you which way to punch in the new version. I do like the coaching at times, but would also like the option to shut it off. Other positives include ability to select intensity and workouts seem a little harder so get my heart rate up quicker.

It'd be nice to have a choice of more than one venue, but it's a better venue than the previous three, so that's good. I like the way the playlists are sorted by genre and pace, and have discovered a couple of new ones accordingly.\n\nI do have a couple of issues though. The sensitivity seems to be very different. I was regularly racking up 1.000+ streaks but in FitVR it was simply not recognising my uppercuts or left hooks. I found out by overemphasising the actions, almost ridiculously so, it would recognise them. That needs tweaking. Also, please allow the option to turn off the explosion effects if hit a target. It's very off-putting, as many have commented.\n\nI'm glad you can turn off the commentary.

Quick pros and cons \n\n**Pros**\n- The new explosive meter is a good motivator to push yourself harder.\n- I haven't seen pauses when songs switch like I did BoxVR\n- The online classes are motivating. You can choose to do a class online or solo. If you go online you'll get a leaderboard with everyone else and it helps push yourself to move up the ranking.\n\n**Cons**\n- More limited customization (not that Box was really that customizable but this is even less). You can't change the environment, make custom \"classes\", change glove/target color, etc...\n- \"Streak\" is now really \"explosive streak\" (more about this below )\n- Doesn't have detailed stats at the end. (like exactly how many moves were hit by category.)\n\n**Improvment requests**\nHere are the things that could be improved.\n\n- Either give the option to have streak really be a total streak or have both. Explosive is like a sprint and you can't sprint for a full class. I used to always strive for a \"perfect\" class where I didn't miss a target. No it doesn't matter because you have one not explosive move and it's over. I went from getting 1000 plus streaks to 30. (Hit a fast punch section and it's over)\n- Add more environments. Depending on my mood the future techno look is cool but lots of time I would choose the gyms to feel more real/connected. An amazing feature would be to have the targets look like actual training mitts in an old gym. It would give it a \"Rocky\" fewl which for a lot of people would be motivating. Even make it a chargeable add on and I'd buy it.\n- Add detailed stats on the class before you start. I'd like to see how many punches/squats are in a class. For Leg day I'd want a squat heavy option but can't find it.\n\nHelpful | 1", "CircusCynaneus23 days ago\nFitVR\n\nReplaced BoxVR, still essentially the same but has some bugs to work out. First off there is no quit or exit to leave the game. I don't know what is going on with the hit counter, I think it is supposed to be tracking power hits in a row but I see the power bar showing with jabs at about a 4 getting counted and uppercuts and crosses showing a 6-8 power but count as a miss. It would be nice to track which classes have been done and how well it was performed so that a player could return and try to better their stats. The multi player bit isn't working well, after about 5 minuts all the other players are dropped and you finish against a group that isn't playing. A more minor thing that I'll probably get used to is the barriers are blue coming from an area with the same blue back ground, a number of times I'm focused on the targets the suddenly notice the barrier is coming, so a colour change or a choice of colours would be nice. I'm hoping / expecting these issues will get delt with, and I continue to play as it is still a good fitness based game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ouisamae24 days ago\nLoving the new FitXR!!\n\nThere seem to be missed reviews, but personally, I love the upgrade!!

Natural sunlight tends to work better than superficial light. - Make sure your controllers aren't too far away from the lenses (as having your arms down or towards the left/right and lifting them suddenly can cause issues) - Disable hand tracking.

I know you don't through punchs in BeatSabre and its all flippy twisty wrist movements, but it's a more enjoyable experience all around. Better concept, gets you much more active and provides much better quality tunes that really provide a much better work out.\n\nI guess its more of a dance game and that will no doubt put butch macho types off, which is a real shame.\n\nFrom a technical aspect I was having a real problems getting game to actually start!

In fact I kind of hate it.\n* Levels - They are a mystery now. I have no idea how they are computed. I assume a combination of power and streaks? Kind of annoying not to know.\n* Particle Effects - Let me turn them off or tone them down. The explosive hit effect is extremely distracting.\n* Custom Workouts - Or should I say the removal of custom workouts.\n* The inability from the workout menu screen to easily see which ones I have already done. Having to click on the workout and see if there are recorded scores is a pain.\n* The Calorie count - It has never been great but computing near 20 calorie a minute burn is outlandish.\n\nI guess I will give it three stars because at it's core you can still jump in, hit targets and burn some calories but I have to remove a few stars for the negatives introduced with the new version.\n\nOh, and you want to earn a 1 star review for the Rift version?

Please be reassure that we're going to be adding an exit button in the neat future. With the streaks, so we can work to give you the best workout possible, we've changed the way streaks are calculated with FItXR. For any cues you hit accurately these are converted into FitXR points which will change where you're at on the leaderboard and allow you to level up throughout the workout. The streaks that are calculated individually are now called 'explosive streaks' and to get these you'll need to get multiple explosive punches in a row. To get an explosive punch, you'll need to accurately hit a jab or cross at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S.

You likely have a very comprehensive list of the problematic issues from the majority of those who have reviewed FitXR - and I pretty much agree.\nSome I want to emphasize - Please bring back the gloves as an option, bring back multiple environments, give option of previous hit effect (new splash one does have its appeal, but can be distracting during longer workouts), workout goals and rewards need to be restored.\nAnd the colours of the gloves, balls and barriers are too similar. Yellow, blue, light blue are too close together on colour spectrum and make it more difficult to see whats coming (especially the bars for squats, ducks). The bright blue, pink and orange of BoxVR were much more differentiated and thus more visually accessible.\nAs you have been responding to many of the reviews that you are taking note of feedback and passing it onto your team (which is great), I do hope that action is taken soon. The quickest course would be to offer the old BoxVR as an option (with previous glitches fixed).\nYour team of developers designed a great program in BoxVR that easily ranks among the top VR experiences for many of us - as is evident in the passion of many of the reviewers.

So much so, I actually went into it thinking I was going to hate it. I did a few workouts in the new mode and really enjoyed it overall. I thought the updated graphics, sounds, and explosions were a great addition and made the overall experience even better! Ive read a lot of reviews saying the explosions get in your way when you punch the orbs  but I didnt have any issues seeing what was ahead of me. I actually discovered that when you hit them with less force they dont really explode at all and this really motivated me to keep my arms swinging quickly, which leads to a greater workout!\n\n\nThere are definitely a few cons such as glitches (my hands would just take off as if I threw them), no multiple rooms to choose from (I really love the new room!) but I feel like these are easy fixes and will come soon in later updates.\n\nOverall, I asked myself if I would go back to the old one as many reviewers have commented. If Im being honest, I wouldnt! I love the updated version and think theres a lot of room to grow and have faith that it will.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI first gave this 3-4 stars a week after playing.

Its really keeping me on consistent workouts every day (and Ive been finding some good squat levels)!\n\nTIP- turn the sound effects half way down or off and it totally makes it even more enjoyable.

The light category workouts are a solid workout, but the moderate category ones leave me completely beat after only 10 minutes.

The jabs are the issue, they dont register unless the punch is straight forward perfectly and already having forward momentum. There have been countless forward jabs I threw that the game didnt register because it was slightly angled from being after a cross or hook. They need to make an option so if you connect with the job period, you hit the circle! Either that are change the way the circles look, more like forward hooks, with lines pointing forward saying it has to be moving perfectly straight to get the point. A very simple fix that would make the game much more enjoyable\n\nUPDATE: The new FitXR version is much better than the old one but still has a ways to go. I still get jabs robbed from me when they clearly hit and I never had that feeling playing Beat Saber. The visual polish is MUCH better and the particle effects are nice. The group class element is very nice and the leaderboards are a great motivator along with the bonus points for punching harder. Also a fan of the stat tracker by day week or month.

Now we have this update to FitXR and I want to like it and everything seems great and moving in the right direction, but I have run into some issues that I did not have before.\n\nNot all my hits register so my streaks are low, with BoxVR you hit it or miss it and it was very obvious. Now all indications are that I hit and hit correctly, but the counter shows a miss. If I am not hitting correctly then there should be some indication so that I can correct for it. It should not explode and produce the feel like I hit it if I missed or did not hit it correctly.\n\nThe other issue is that it disconnects me saying I dont have an internet connection, but I exit the game and everything is connected just fine and no indication that connection ever dropped. Once this happens your class ends as if it crashed. Whether the connection is actually dropping or not it would be better to just drop out of multiplayer and let the class continue. The basic purpose is fitness, everything else is a bonus and makes it fun. If the class ends due to a perceived disconnect it is like stopping in the middle of workout which is never good.

I like the Power indicator in this new upgrade and not having to mess around with the gloves. However, I am very frustrated with the glitch in the hit streaks. I even would do the Basic courses to see if I was doing something wrong. It registers the points but the streak goes back to zero sometimes continuously. When competing against others it is hard to believe they have a max streak. The favorites button also doesn't seem to work when I try to save a class I like. I miss my daily goals to keep me motivated. I like the change of how to block and it is a great improvement. I was saved by BoxVR as it didn't require Internet and I was in solo quarantine for 14 days due to Covid measures. The place I was in had no internet. It really helped me pass the time away and stay in shape. I am glad the upgrade didn't happen before then. So like mentioned before please bring back a retro option not requiring internet.

Since the update however, we have received a lot of feedback about these punches and how demotivating it is to lose a streak, so we are in discussions about ways we can improve this feature to keep our community motivated whilst still working hard. You are able to play FitXR offline. When you first complete a workout you will need to be connected to the internet so the workout can download fully. We've done this to prevent issues with offline play but we do completely understand that this isnt an ideal situation for everyone, so we have added this to our roadmap to look into changing in the near future.", "Anoraknid24 days ago\nBoxVR was happy Fan now an Angry Man\n\nThere is so much wrong with upgrade.

It would have been nice to have been informed that it was such a radical visual update though; maybe I missed the office memo? I always liked the 'Gym' (it made me feel like I was 'sticking it to the man by having a Gym membership I wasn't paying for :D.\nI like the fact we can 'compete' online with individual profiles if more than one of us share the Quest in the household. I also like the addition of the ghosts; it's a smart way to 'compete' against others, although it would be nice to know if you were actually competing against any real players (with ghosts filling any vacant slots) because playing against someone's ghost is not the same as going toe-to-toe with them in real time). Also, their scores update after the session's completed, so you can think you're ahead by 5000 points, and then find you've been beaten into third.\n\nDEVs. I still love it, but here's my suggestive feedback\n1) It would be good to add a calorie modifier to each profile. Just done a 16 minute session: FitXR estimated 717 kCals burnt, but it was actually only 215Cals (so I burnt ~1/3 of the calories FitXR advertised)\n2) Can we have a settings option to turn off, or reduce, the frequency of Ms Motivator's comments? PLEASE!\n3) Any chance we can get the option back to build our own routines\n4) Not sure if the glove contact mechanics have changed but, like others, the timing seems a bit off, but maybe it's just me\nCheers.\n\nOP (for Box VR):\nOk. So I'm a middle aged (late forties), average kind of guy. I like to be active and although I'm not a fitness freak, I start to feel a bit 'meh' if I don't get the old heart pumping at least once a week. So, having read all the lowest star reviews (that's the way I roll), I still thought I'd give this a go. I'm glad I did; I've been sweating on it daily! I have had the occasional tracking miss on the left hand, but my daughter has had misses on the right, so I think it's down to hand to headset positioning. It doesn't detract from the exercise benefits though.\n\nDevs: Well done!

You now also get a meter that shows how well you hit notes on the beat. I liked the app before, but now it's even better. I am actually happy to have bought this on two platforms as the developers deserve the purchase.\n\nI played this on Steam during beta before getting the Oculus Quest so I have clocked quite a bit of game time.\n\nThis app has one purpose: give you an excellent cardio workout and it does that one thing very well. It's fun and it's probably the game I wind up playing the most on VR because of its simplicity, the fact that you can play it in a small place and still get an excellent workout.\n\nEven if you stay in one place, somehow it's even more fun to play it on the Quest.

I could not seem to get a really intense workout with the previous version, and even bought wrist weights. This new version now provides a very intense work out. I am gasping for air and feel it in my shoulders the next day. This has become part of my regular workout routine. I think the exploding punches are the key - great idea adding that. I also like playing against the other players (they are not live, but have previously done that class). It really gives me something to aim for while playing which was something missing from the previous version. Well done!\n\nOriginal Review for Box XR:\nI came close to returning this as I just could not figure out the uppercut and the swing moves. I just kept getting the timing wrong and it was very frustrating as I thought it was the glove adjustment. Fortunately, I persevered and got the hang of it. For the glove adjustment, just put your fists where they would be inside the gloves. To hit the uppercuts and swings, just focus on the white dots. You don't need to do anything fancy or fast, in fact you can swing quiet slowly. Just focus on and swing at the white dot, as if you are trying to hit the front of it. Keep going, and eventually you will get it. Once you get it, the game is really enjoyable. However, for me, it is more of just a workout than a game. There is a score you get, but it has no context unless you know your previous score on the same workout or are competing against someone. I try different workouts each time, so the score is meaningless, as is getting so many hits in a row. I have been playing TOTF, but as a workout, it can be too intense for times when I want something a little slower. If I want a steady 45 - 60 min workout then it is BoxVR. If I want a HIIT for 30 mins or less then it is TOTF. All-in-all a great workout app.\n\nHelpful | 1", "theodore.lindsay10 days ago\nHuge improvement!\n\ntl;dr: the new upgrade takes this from another attempt at a workout video game to something that is much closer to an actual sport!\n\nSo Ive been waiting for a long time for someone to figure out how to take the addictive imagination of video games and meld it to the physicality of actual sports. With this upgrade I think the game may have gotten close to that.\n\nI actually purchased my quest because I had heard about this game supernatural and thought it might be what Ive been hoping for. I actually discovered boxvr after I got my quest. Both games have been a lot of fun- but unfortunately without any feedback for swinging or hitting harder, my motor system would quickly learn how to cheat and play the game using just flicking and minimal effort - no matter how conscious I was about this, it still happened - and the physical component of the game would quickly pieter out. After all, this is what motor learning is supposed to do..\n\nTwo new additions to the game finally address this: (1) If you swing hard you get immediate feedback with an exploding target - providing instant satisfaction for the added effort. (2) The game keeps tracks of streaks of fast swings - reminding you not to shirk off when youre getting tired.\n\nBefore this feedback, the game still felt like any old video game where the physics of your body and and the physics of the game were somewhat disconnected. Imagine if you were playing tennis and the ball went over the net at the same speed no matter how hard you swung.. only at the end of a set you might get some extra points for power.\n\nIm really having fun playing the new upgrade. I still think there might be even more ways to tightly couple the player kinematics with the game dynamics, but perhaps there is a limitation in the quest hardware. More challenging game sequences would also be welcome, but overall really excited about where they are taking the game.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Bugtato6 days ago\nIf you like boxing you will enjoy this!\n\nI was wary about VR workout because like, big thing on my head.

Ive been using BoxVR to get back into shape, and its something i use in my daily regimen.\n\nThat said, improvements can be had. Quite noticeably, the hit targets are very small, and getting the timing on the hits are more challenging than it needs to be (depth perception is still challenging, and the space to register a hit tiny - perhaps thats my age and a particular problem for my eyes (46 and with astigmatism).\n\nAnother area is with the dodge objects. The left or right leaning dodges never work. The only way to register a dodge for those is to squat down really low. And a low squat doesnt always register, and that varies according to the workout program being run.\n\nEven the vertical squat blocks are inconsistent, as squat to dodge, and watch my hit count revert to 0.\n\nWhile not a deal breaker, it ruins the experience of all the work you put into a workout.\n\nPlease clean up these little problems - while i still get the workout, these issues are nonsensical and takes away from the reward of using your program.\n\nKevin\n\nHelpful | 0", "MorganRenae21 days ago\nFun but frustrating!\n\nI lost 70lbs using the BoxVR version so I was curious what they changed about the FitXR and I felt like they just tried to make it seem too much like the other fitness apps and took away the boxing feel. The streaks are frustrating because I was on an intense level and I hit every single one of those punches and yet my streaks would only be on average 3-4 with my max being 50, while in the other game my streaks would be in the thousands.\n\nIm not sure what the leveling up really does, and I didnt really care about it as a whole or used it to track anything. Im focused more on how many hits I can land and the power level (which I wish would be more eye level).\n\nMultiplayer was exciting at first and I love a good competition, but everyone always quit within the first five minutes. Id win but it felt more like a participation trophy.\n\nOne suggestion for a future update is have the punches rotate 360 degrees in order to simulate a boxing experience and have block moves come to your sides. Itll get a lot more footwork involved.\n\nOverall, Im still going to use it for now but I definitely want to see improvements if Im going to continue to use it.

With this in mind, Ive logged and passed over your great idea of the rotating punches and block moves. We completely understand that the streaks can be a little demotivating and frustrating so we are looking into how we can improve them. Currently, youll receive a streak when you produce multiple explosive punches in a row (at a speed of 3.3 M/S for jabs and crosses and 5.1M/S for, hooks and uppercuts). With the levels, each time you start a workout, youll begin at level 1 and as you accurately hit cues, avoid dodges and squats and increase your explosive streaks, youll level up. The aim of this is to get to level 10 as this requires you to get 90% of the FitXR points for that particular workout.

I was looking at other apps and was reading the mostly bad reviews for FitXR thinking based on reviews there is no way I would pay for that. Of course then I realized that it had replaced my BoxVR. For developers to switch an app that I already paid for with another almost completely different app that I didn't pay for or agree to is beyond shady. The canned responses from the developers on the reviews seem to show no concern at all or address this issue. To be honest what they did as far as completely removing a paid app and replacing it with another similar app and then calling it an update is almost completely unheard of and would be a horrible practice for reputable developers to do. They can take whatever input they want to try and improve FitXR. But unless they reconcile what they did to consumers who bought BoxVR I would fully support kicking them off Oculus store approved apps altogether and at the very least will not drop another dime on anything these developers have any part in. Again, I haven't seen any comments from the developers that have addressed the slightly unethical complete switching of a platform of a game and calling it an update. But since I already paid for something I will continue to use.\n\nSo for the actual FitXR. I've used it for a few days so haven't got the full feel of all the different features yet. I liked BoxVR better for various reasons because I'm doing it solely for exercise. The arcade feel of the whole thing is very busy on the screen and I would like to be able to turn off the explosions for sure. It's very distracting. I do actually like that you can turn off squats for individual classes instead of just sorting classes by no squats. It would be nice if you could turn them off mid session. I do like that you can pause and resume if you need to stop for some reason. BoxVR you could only restart. Overall I don't mind the gloves thing because the hands seem to line up better. If the gloves weren't calibrated properly before it changed the angle and gave you lower score. I don't think that it is as good as BoxVR but I still think it's doable for a workout. The music sucks but that's because it's like a fitness class at gym and their music also is not my style. The developer issues aside I think the app in its current state is not worth the money. But the actual play of it is not as bad as some reviews indicate and I'll continue to throw it into my workout routine\n\nHelpful | 2", "chopsuey077 days ago\nCould be better.\n\nOverall all, i go with what the majority are saying. Box vr > fit xr. Just the matter of fact that it has custom option and does not require internet connection to play. There's really no reason to sign up for an account just to play. What i do and how i work out shouldn't matter to you folks or anyone else. If it does, do give me the custom options like box vr, then we'll talk.\n\nSince it requires internet connection, I'll sometimes get lags and delay when there's heavy internet usage. I say this because i tend to only play when everyone is asleep at night with minimal internet usage beside me, smooth game play. As soon as people start waking up in the morning and using the internet, mileage will vary.\n\nIn terms of game play, workout music could be better. Like someone else mention, at one points it's like elevator music. Needs some good music to give you that good pump to encourage you to go beast mode or maybe a custom Playlist. But we all know that's not going to happen. Only thing i like about fit xr is the streak system and the \"explosion\". That feature at least encourage you to put more effort or tell you you're half assing you're punches. That's about it.\n\nFeels like this is more catered towards new folks getting into working out. Nothing wrong with that but it feels like its been really dumb down from BoxVR in getting ready to target the new audiences coming to oculus quest. I understand there's dlc pack but I'll wait on how they're going to update this game in the future to see if it's worth getting the dlc at its current price point.\n\nI mean it does get me drenching in a pool of sweat, but then again it's summer time and wearing the headset will make you sweat regardless if you're really moving around because of the heat build up.\n\nFor now, this is the only thing that's available for what it is, whether you like it or not, until someone else comes up with a better version with no internet connection required as an option just to play. Until then, might just have to buy BoxVR on steam for the better overall experience.\n\nHelpful | 0", "migbuster6 days ago\nSo far good but...\n\nIve read some of the reviews so mostly my concerns and issues or likes have been already written.\n\nI think there is a bug for the option favorite, as u click on it at the end of a lesson it seems to save it on your favorite workouts.

The new streak mechanic is what was needed, pushing you to hit those targets to obtain it rather than flailing in a hit for the sake of the streak. This also makes the new multiplayer mechanic much more competitive and turns a good workout into something you'll be feeling for days.\n\nMy only real complaints would be that after a 700 odd hit streak the bright flashing of colours on a dark background can wear on the eyes. I think this needs to be toned back a bit, not the effects but the brightness of them. The menu system and tracking your activities doesn't seem as intuitive but I really haven't spent a lot of time with it yet so it's more of a first impression/observation.\n\nOverall though I'm really pleased and look forward to what else gets added.\n\n**Edit** I did have an issue with incorrectly purchasing DLC for the Rift app instead of Quest but was instructed to contact the support email address and they promptly sorted me out!

As a fitness app I figured good enough. I was pleasantly surprised by the update to fitXR. Workouts look better, feel better and are more motivating.\n\nTo my last point, when you do a workout, you (optionally) compete against the ghosts of previous players which is surprisingly motivating due to a live scoreboard. I keep finding myself looking at the list of people and how many points I need to pass the next person. It keeps me engaged and I always feel the right amount of competition.\n\nThe new visuals and presentation are more modern and feel like a new game. Its evident a lot of care went into the interface. The old one was ok so again pleasantly surprised by the new (free) upgrade.\n\nGameplay is similar but seems smoother. I dont know that the music has changed but I feel like it has for the better and I also feel the punches are more aligned with the rhythm.\n\nIf I had a couple of criticisms I would say the voiceover work of the trainers gets really repetitive. Some songs dont have voiceover which is sometimes preferred. Less frequent and more precise comments would be best. My only other criticism is that it seems like it takes too much force to blow up a target. This is really just an annoyance during a quick sequence when you lose a streak. For one off targets, it makes you work harder ( which is the point!)\n\nI dont feel these criticisms offset the good here and really just represent improvement opportunities to an awesome game. 5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 0", "penguindangler20 days ago\nGood first version\n\nNow, on to fixing the bugs and glitchy stuff and make this the great fitness VR game its meant to be!\n\nI am particularly miffed by disappearing fists.

It's alot more satisfying hitting the orbs with the right timing with the FX and the hit detection seems to be alot better. There's better indication for the right angle to hit as well, so I find myself uppercutting my headset less. I also like the new force mechanic which encorouges you to hit harder for those satisfying hits - and burn more calories.\n\nThe new stage is on the right side of Tron :) I wouldn't mind more at some point for a bit of variation, but it's certainly better than the old stages.\n\nI love the idea of group classes, and live leaderboards while your playing, it adds a layer of competition which makes it an even more intense experience - on problem I have, there seems to be a bug where everyone leaves the class on the first song, this has happend every time. Hopefully this will get ironed out in another patch.\n\nI think some of these 1 star reviews are a bit unfair, but I guess that was going to happen with a major update and rebrand. At it's core it's still BoxVR just more refined and polished, I feel most of the changes have been for the good, we just need a few more stages to mix it up a bit and maybe some retro options like the ability to toggle effects for those who miss the old Box VR. I personally don't mind the lack of playlists because I only play the classes, and prefer the more curated experience but I can see why some people might be upset that's gone, each to their own.\n\nOverall best fitness game on the quest.\n\nHelpful | 1", "NikkiVR109 days ago\nAmazing so far!\n\nI love this game its so easy to workout and really sweat it out.

And the multilayer mode also helps you compete with others in a simple way. I measured my calories burnt with apple watch, setting it to boxing in the fitness app, and since the upgrade, using the same boxing routine in the fitness app, im loosing more calories in the same duration of a workout.

This isn't happening when going through the menu, only in the game. Just when you get into the game, the game stops with an extremely annoying sound asking you to change your stance. The floating hands only happen in this game and that should be fixed before cashing in on add-ons. It's not caused by my quest (only game with this issue), lighting situation or anything else.

Having other people in a class with you is so motivating. The vocals are not as good as I'd like - vocal triggers on key milestones like 25 hit or 50 can get annoying rather than motivating, hearing \"great speed\" or something like \"you're doing great\" after you've missed as punch is very annoying too.\nFrequently hits don't register which is highly frustrating but all in all this is by far the best workout app on Oculus Quest. I'd suggest getting a rubber face guard as you will get very sweaty.\nEach class is set to music and sees you perform ducking, upper cuts, jabs or swings with your arms, it's as simple as that. A live leaderboard of the class will have you really pushing yourself.\nI hooked up the YUR calories tracker app in the Oculus and must say it registers far lower than the calories FitXR tells me I've burned off - I think FitXR might be a little on the generous side in this regard as my tracker watch also comes no way near what FitXR suggests I hit per workout.\nI know I've moaned about a number of things, but this really is worth the money.

BoxVR felt cartoony for me and I wasn't a fan of some of the design choices and colors scheme (nitpicky I know). Something about it didn't click with me like the other games do maybe because it lacked in the visual department. The tracks were always great and I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it. It definitely has the strongest track list by far and it still maintains that. This upgrade brings significantly cleaner/modern UI and also creates a class-like atmosphere which is something I sorely missed from pre-covid days.

You need to be able to do so on a dime, and if it you do it with the appropriate ferocity and suddenness, you basically throw the VR headset off your face and have to re-adjust. Blocking is awkward, and can't be done properly due to the limitations of the Quest.\n\nSpecifically in this game, it encourages you to slip and duck. I was afraid that it would make you move your head WAY out of the center line, but, in my experience, it does a wonderful job making you slip *just enough*. So you can keep your slips nice and tight. You never want to exaggerate a slip - you're dodging a punch, not a wrecking ball.\n\nYou work in a simple rhythm, which can be useful to a degree, but it's not the INSANELY complex rhythm of an actual fight. GET SPARRING EXPERIENCE! You're trying to disrupt their rhythm while making your own unpredictable. That's one of the hardest parts of boxing. Don't let this game condition you.\n\nWhen you hit an incoming ball, do so SUDDENLY. Don't telegraph!\n\nPerforming hooks on an incoming target is helpful - hooking a speeding object takes practice, and is practical.\n\nGREAT GAME OVERALL! YOU WILL LOSE WEIGHT!\n\nHelpful | 345", "xx_Megan_xx17 minutes ago\nAmazing and fun\n\nI love this app! Great graphics, the speed is challenging, combinations are well thought out.

Also the force bar is a nice addon\n- Instructor voice gives you a bit more motivation\n\nHowever I totally understand those 1 star reviews for suddenly require a registration. This should be fixed ASAP. Not a good move at all and it really should not weigh down on this game!\n\nOne thing I dearly miss is the endless mode.

That said, I was getting a little bored of the old BoxVR and this new update (for free) has refreshed my interest. Just finished a workout and was absolutely knackered so I think competing scores is a good motivator. There are definitely some things that need ironing out but for me personally I see a lot more longevity in this version than the old.\n\nI do understand why people who loved the old version are upset so maybe a classic mode would be a good thing to include.

Currently I haven't been working out for about a month or two, I was hot and heavy then it kinda got dull and I had performance issues etc that took the crap out and I was getting irritated with the headset dropping, so lets say I've not done it with the BOXVR game in a while.\n\nWell I read on reddit that they changed the name to FitXR or something and I open it up it's a whole new \"game\". Multiplayer classes, redesigned ui, more metrics and it saves information like high scores now (a lot of the complaints of the older BOXVR game) and 10 minutes again made me sweat. And the cool part? I freaking out did the rest of the \"class\" :)\n\nNeedless to say I liked it before now it's a new love the only thing that wasn't changed is the game play, still based on punches, upper cuts side jabs and squats but everything else changed, music, UI in session and out.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Deadestpool20 days ago\nI was about to give 1 star first\n\nAt first I was really angry, like all the other 1* reviewers since the update. I lost my customized workouts and highscores, didn't care so much for the environment, but found the targeting way too much off. Then I read those negative reviews and the devs responses to just about all of them. Yes, the responses were about the same when the issues pointed out were. But I have not found any issue which was not addressed and everything became pretty much repetitive after more than a hundred negative reviews. Still they respond.\nThey say they built this app up again from the ground and will add new AND (improved) OLD features, including customization, better menu visuals for workout lengths and personal workout completion.\nThe multiplayer as is only shows recordings of 6 other player's exercise and their points during their workout (so not really much difference to \"real\" multiplayer workouts, only that you cannot interact with the others), but it is currently stopping after the first track and being fixed soon. They say they will also bring back realtime multiplayer with additional content/tasks. There is too much visual feedback for perfect punches (halos and fireworks) distracting from successive targets and they acknowledged this multiple times.\nThis completely new app already has around 60 workouts plus a handful warm-ups and some improvements have been made, like favorite workout, sorting of workouts according to music etc. and the motivating hit meter with the streak system.\nSo I was appeased and have done a few more workouts and got better in scoring, just now completed a nearly 60 minute one with a 214 max. streak.\n\nSee, before the update people have complained that this app stops being a real workout after just a few weeks when their fitness has improved or being no workout at all when they were already fit. Now, with the long workouts it is REALLY HARD to get to level 10 (some tracking issue contributes to that, though, see below). Still I got to >9.5 (less than half a circle missing) during that long workout just now. And I am sweating so much more with the constant effort to get perfect punches. My shoulder and upper arm muscles are still aching even after 2 days (my first really long workout after the update). I am now dreading the punches more than the squats and ducks, where before it has been the opposite (seems my legs are worked out well now after nearly a hundred hours of BoxVR).\nSo now I see this as a new basic game with lots of possibilities which will improve over time and considering that the team seems to be really enthusiastic to address user demands and apparently already had quite some plans for future updates anyway, I give it 5 stars. There has not been any freezing which happened about every third >50min workout before. I still \"lost my glove\" once where before it suddenly floated beside my head. I hope they will still be able to address this.\n\nThere are quite a few more basic issues where improvement is required:\n1. Less force/speed requirements (e.g. 50%) to achieve a perfect punch for the fastest succession of targets (2nd-fastest still manageable, but exhausting, nice workout). The team already responded several times that they are discussing this already.\n2. Complete streak reset with the first non-perfect punch is a total letdown. Better subtract 1, 2 or even 5 points from the existing streak.\n3. Hits sometimes do not get registered for uppercuts, especially for the right hand. Seems the target area and/or hand movement direction have been narrowed down too much? Strangely from squatting position this works better.\n4. Everyone tries to make ALWAYS perfect punches (as it should be since it is rewarded!) and it looks to me like the FitXR team did not test the game much in that regard. Even the \"light\" workouts, especially the ones >50 minutes are getting really, really hard this way. And you need at least 30 minutes to get into a proper cardio, no matter how fit you are.\nSo there should be at least an easy setting for the same workouts where you score either less points or compete only with others in easy setting (in the latter case maybe for the future realtime multiplayer there should be only 1 setting per workout or you won't have any opponents if there are several \"leagues\"). Even better would be 3 levels.\nEasier means bigger target area and wider \"movement direction alley\" for perfect punches and also a little less force/speed requirements. Still better would be sliders to adjust this like in some other fitness games, with 5 different settings or so (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4) with respective point multiplication. But that might get too complicated and hard to realize with fair point systems.\n\nAlso, it would be good to be able to switch the streak feature back to simple hit/miss like before. Even if that is then called super easy or off record. I really liked to get into the flow with the music, sometimes making slightly excessive corresponding movements with my arms and upper body, it felt like dancing. Being one with the music, perfectly tuned to the rhythm. That was a major fun factor with Boxvr but this is not possible at all when you always need to focus on hard punches. You're actually starting to blend the music out, which is a pity.\n\nPlease try this yourself, each of you, FitXR team! Do some very long workouts and always try to get perfect punches. There is hardly any flow left, though upper body workout has vastly improved this way. So please make it an option to switch off hard punches, maybe make it perfect timing instead.\n\nThough these are all still urgent issues in my book I am willing to give kudos to the team for this \"restart\". Looking at their responses, they haven't been able to upgrade BoxVR anymore to develop the vision that they had and thus had to rebuilt from scratch. The name alone, FitXR, in my view allows for many more additions, maybe we will get completely new, additional training rooms and methods.\nAnd I think somewhere they mentioned more personal training and some other stuff (which will likely come at a price or subscription, though).\n\nThat said, maybe they should allow for refunds to the really angry people, if they can make a special agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg based on all those devastating reviews. But I'm not sure if those reviews will then be updated to reflect that move, maybe some will give an additional star or two, but these reviewers seem to feel really robbed of their favorite workout app for now.\n\nI for one am now excited for what is to come!\n\nHelpful | 1", "larbar21 days ago\nFitVR takes it to a whole new level\n\nThis BoxVR update indeed deserves the new name...its a whole new game.

When FitXr replaced it, my first impression was positive but after several days I became increasingly frustrated with it. Still, I decided to wait for the first patch before reviewing. It's better, but still has a ways to go.\n\nPros:\n- It has a clean look and I like the new look of the targets.\n- It's still a great workout.\n\nCons:\n- The graphics/particle explosion thing. It's really distracting even toned down and I think it's a large part of why it's hard to maintain streaks\n- Hook accuracy is inconsistent, especially left hook. I hit what looks like a solid punch at a good speed and I still lose my streak\n- I'm looking for a workout, it being a game is secondary. Some of the high speed rounds feel game-y to me \"let's throw a bunch of dodges and tricky combos at high speed to make the game harder.\" Especially with the visual distractions, this can be really frustrating for someone just trying to work out.\n- Internet required\n\nNeutral:\n- The whole \"ghost\" class just seems silly to me.\n- I don't have a strong opinions about the venue change\n\nIf I only had one request to make it better:\n- Let me turn down the punch graphics even further so I can see what's coming.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response15 days ago\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to review FitXR and were so sorry to hear youre frustrated with the update. Id like to reassure you that we are reading and listening to all of the feedback and comments we receive, so we can work to improve FitXR over the upcoming weeks and months. Thank you for your feedback about the particle effect - we did tone this down as youve mentioned after the first patch, just as we wanted to see if this helped, but Ive gone ahead and passed your strong request over for this to be customisable so youre able to tone it down or remove it. With the Hook accuracy, weve found that this often happens when the controller is too far away from the lenses. Having your arms down and lifting them suddenly can cause tracking issues - which tends to happen a lot more in the higher intensity workouts. Just so youre aware, youll only need to be online the first time you complete a workout. After this point, it will download so youre able to play offline. Weve done this so we can ensure each workout is downloaded fully and doesnt cause issues with offline play in the future. I also wanted to mention that we are offering access to BoxVR back to our users if this is something youd be interested in?

Saw big differences in few weeks. I love the music, the boxing, how it brought out my competitive side. I sweat so much after each workout. I know that thrill of the night is even more intense but no way as fun as this game.\n\nBest advice for me to give is to punch as hard as you can with each orb. People complain that its not intense enough but it is if you push yourself. (Ive seen videos of people just tapping the orbs as they come- wont do anything for you!) The new update to fit xr rewards you for picking fast and hard. Love it! I also love the instructors encouragement along the way through the work out.

I've just upgraded to fitXr and done a 30 minute session. while there are a few teething issues this gave me a much better workout - I don't think I've sweated so much on a VR game before.

So your hit streak is always going to be low - especially on long term songs since the hit speed for a power punch is based off your max speed\n\nI liked keeping track of misses versus this weird power punch thing. Its not fun seeing like a 60 max hit streak after like 30 minutes\n\nThe calorie counts are also gone until the end, which Im not sure why since I used that to track my progress and manage hit speed as well.\n\nThe time is also moved to the top left corner which is MUCH harder to see, i like keeping track of the time but now if you look you will probably miss\n\nThe maps you can choose is now forced to the one generic map which i guess is OK, but I miss the old choices.\n\nPROS of update\n\nThe new punching seems a bit more responsive albeit most being counted as miss because its not a power punch (its really annoying see my complaint in the cons section)\n\nThe new way the songs are organized is a bit more modern looking now, but Ill need more time with them to get the full experience\n\nThe level system and points are a lot more interesting than before and gives a sort of goal to head towards\n\nThe new gloves feel a lot more optimized and positions on the controllers\n\nHelpful | 3\nDeveloper Response25 days ago\n\nThank you so much for your feedback - we really do appreciate it.

After a warmup focusing on Beatsaber, and some interval training with Thrill of the Fight, I cool down with Pistol Whip and head here. The tutorial was clear and startup was simple. My favorite option is to pick your own music playlist from several genres, making my own custom workouts. My five workouts are Rock based, but theres something for everyone. Of course there are many predesigned workouts offered with all the genres represented. I also like the custom option because you choose how vigorously you want to move. As a guy I didnt like the default glove colors, and saw that I could change them in settings. As the title says it has become the core of my workouts and makes motivation easy to get high quality cardio exercise with the Quest.\nUPDATE: The above was for Box VR. Liking it as much as I did I was ready to be disappointed when Fit VR replaced it. Its even better! I can choose a music genre among the available workouts, along with other choices. And speed now counts! Before, it could have lead to not so good boxing habits because not missing counted more than power, but not now.

Id finally found a way to select all Hard workouts using the playlists but even those werent great. I still enjoyed it but wished there was a way to choose the intensity of the workout from amongst the preset workouts. I mean Id have 3000+ hit streaks and didnt feel I was working that hard. I mean it was like anyone regardless of how hard they tried could do great, the whole medal for participating concept. And the glitches and missed hits got frustrating at times. So it wasnt a perfect game but good enough.\n\nThis new game that replaced BoxVR is quite different though its still a boxing simulation. But its more challenging. The streaks only occur when you hit the objects with stronger force (I played the hard level, not sure if the same applies to the other levels) . So if you slack off no streak, and it spurs my competitive spirit more to hit harder to build the streak. Ive never burned as many calories in a BoxVR session as I did on FitVR today.\n\nSo dont let the naysayers turn you away, this is different than BoxVR but great and as long as I get back the content I paid for Ill be sticking to this game. Otherwise they better give me my $20 back.\n\nHelpful | 0", "grunicanada23 days ago\nHad BoxVR the update is amazing\n\nI always struggled getting my punches right in BoxVR the new update makes the exercises a lot better and the new visual style and layout is really top notch.

BoxVR had a few tracking issues which would really throw off my timing but that has been fixed! No more issues. Also, the new team training feature is amazing. The leaderboard really pushes me to work so much harder, I love to win first place and to show off my combo rating to the rest of the team. After playing this game for 30 minutes or so Im absolutely soaked with sweat and muscles all throughout my body are super pumped.\n\nShadow boxing is an incredible workout with so many benefits, look it up.

Joining a multi player game is quick easy and it's so much fun to see the little avatars next to me punching away and competing on the scoreboard in front of us. I will probably always play in multi player mode now. It's not at all intimidating its just adds motivation to do better. I love how the players next to you are in a semi circle so you can see all of the figures and their hands and names.\n\nI like the new targets. they are sleek and fit in perfectly with the whole game esthetic which is so smooth. I love the new ...not sure what to call it? power punch indicator? the circle puff? What ever it is it is fun to see and present but not obstructive. It's great, really nice to try for more.\n\nRegarding the new UI. All of the information i need to see is easy to pick out even in the midst of a game and all of the menus are uniformly clear and concise and beautiful to boot. In the old BoxVR some of the menus in game were hard to see and somehow obstructive at the same time? An odd unfortunate accomplishment. But no more.

It feels like you're in a smaller space which makes the barriers a bit more challenging (good). They've also modified the scoring system for the better, with strike speed playing an important part. This really increases workout intensity for me. Also it seems more forgiving of misses but has streaks of fast hits.\n\nI think these changes have improved it greatly and I bought their high intensity pack as I can see myself using it more as a fitness aid.\n\nThe one thing i wish it had was workouts that require greater foot movement and stretching by having a wider track with the targets coming to the sides, higher, and lower. Also having targets swapping sides would encourage wide crosses for flexibility. Perhaps even a head butt mode with you having to jump/duck/lean to hit head targets (youd need an onscreen indicator of head position for that to work though).\n\nHelpful | 0", "SurrealSculptor6524 days ago\nawesome for all levels\n\ni've been reading a lot of these reviews, and they all have merit.

I think I have the accept that this game was not meant for people like me.\n\nI am a long practiced martial artist and my boxing style is a mix of American boxing with Phillipino martial arts.

Very exciting to see the game being given such an overhaul by its developers!!\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: Box VR is part of my daily workout now. I bought it during lockdown, back in March, and its been fantastic to use as a workout game. Both my wife and I have used it regularly and time flies when youre in the zone!\n\nThe game has a good mix of songs, is very accessible and works well within limited space. Most importantly it makes you sweat and - with longer durations - really puts you through your paces.\n\nHowever, its the most bugged game I have on the Quest. LOTS of crashes, rendering it unplayable, and Ive tried everything to make it work well. I even emailed the devs directly, but got no response. Id say its 50/50 if itll work seamlessly, and from reading comments this experience seems to be a shared one. Ive probably got 40+ games on the Quest and really this is the only one that crashes the system and requires force resets.\n\nThe game could do with more songs, more environments, and more variance in the exercises. Otherwise it could risk becoming stale extremely quickly. Yes, I know theres DLC, but at 22.99 I really dont want to have to buy additional content whilst the main game is seemingly untouched and unimproved.\n\nTheres also a number of things that could be improved:\n\n*More environments - just to mix it up!\n\n*Scoreboards - to motivate you to try harder\n\n*Better labelling of workouts - what song genre is it, for example? Right now its a lucky dip.\n\n*Favouriting workouts - I have no idea why this isnt already a feature\n\n*Higher intensity workouts under 3 mins - just when you want a very quick and intense workout\n\n*Labelling tracks on-screen - so its easier to see the songs playing and add them to your own workout playlist.\n\n*Extra body movements - give us some more things to do during workouts! Whether its stepping, or rotating... anything!! Again, just to make the game feel fresher.\n\n*Custom tracks - it works amazingly for Synth Riders and Oh Shapes; Id love to see it cleanly implemented in this.\n\n*New music OR rotating tracks - its be great to have new tracks or at the least have tracks rotated in and out so theres more reasons to play the game.\n\n\n\nHonestly theres probably about 30 other suggestions I could put forward, which to me shows how unloved this game appears to be with it developers as very little seems to have been done to update it in any significant way. Its in dire need of a refresh, or at least a sequel game. Id buy a BOX VR 2 if it was a big improvement over this version, but I dont want to have to pay for DLC.\n\nSo its good, perhaps even very good... just not great. But it COULD be, and it wouldnt need a major overhaul to get there either. Id recommend it if youre after a good workout game, but bearing in mind that exercise is a lot about motivation, this game needs to try harder to motivate you to want to keep playing it.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseJul 21 at 12:57 AM\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave this review.

If they fix the basic problems this could be a revolution in home training. These problems are the reason for only three stars: The precision of the tracking has declined. Especially hooks are delayed and the animation of a successful punch happens too late. Also sometimes I lose a combo without any misses. Lastly: I only have community competition for about 5 minutes into the session. After that the connection seems lost- I can't see other players moving nor does their score change.\nIf you fix these basics - this could become my absolute favourit app. Already with the flaws I'm really motivated to keep on throwing punches.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ScottyTMan7221 days ago\nIts OK ... but\n\nI wanted an update that allowed more variety in picking environments. This is a completely different fitness app. You changed the title from BoxVR to FitXR which makes no sense to me. Im guessing a new company took over?\nI havent explored it much but from what I see, it looks bland, dark and boring now. I liked the boxing gloves better in the older version and was expecting to be given more color choices for an update. I paid for BoxVR because it was different and the music was fun and livelier much more vibrant. FitXR is going to get old fast. BoxVR was fine the way it was. It just needed add on packages like Beat Sabor. And as positive as Im trying to be, I cant ignore the fact that I and others PAID for BoxVR and you took something away from us.\n\nOn a good note, I Do like the power punch idea. I noticed It also has improved in sensitivity function where the punches dont skip like the older one. I will look into it more and still use it. But this is just my honest opinion. I like colors and variety as its been said according to science that colors effect moods. A shiny wooden floor felt more like a gym environment and punching those bright balls coming at me was satisfying!\nIm going to miss BoxVR \n\nOk quick crazy creative suggestion if youre allowed to do this or maybe something similar.\nWhy dont you create a Pac-Man video game environment and in that package, make us jump to reach up and tap the Pac-Man for power enable to give a hard punch at ghosts coming at us or something. And double punch the white pills that turn the ghosts blue. OH I WOULD BUY IT! I WOULD BUY IT!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response21 days ago\n\nThank you for your review and feeback about FitXR!We are still the same company but weve changed the name of the game to our company name to get our community excited for whats to come in the future!

We have only implemented one version of these as we wanted to ensure they were the best they could be, and a better standard to what was available for BoxVR. We are however listening to the community and please be reassured Ive passed your request for these features over to the team.

I have not had one working class yet.\n\nIve had the game glitch where the screen became covered in scattered blue blocks of colour, obscuring the incoming hit pads.\n\n\nOk, appraisal of the game itself:\n\nPros\n- a variety of classes, instructors, and music.\n- a good daily, weekly, monthly stats counter\n- nice graphics\n- nice sounds, such as encouraging words from instructors\n- will probably get you fit if you stick at it\n\nCons\n- no variation in scenery. The old version had three different kwoons. This has one.\n- scored by power over precision. It is impossible to get a 100% streak on this version, as youre too wiped out to do the power shots required before the end of each session.\n- In the previous version I really enjoyed aiming for 100% hooks, jabs, dodges etc, but that has gone. Why?\n- The calorie counter cannot possibly be accurate, as the game does not record your height or weight - only your gender and age. I suggest it overestimates calories burned by around 30%.\n\nSummary:\nI can see the overall attempt to revitalise the game, and I applaud the effort. However, in its current buggy state with some of the more fun features removed, and a calorie counter you cant depend upon, Im hard pressed to recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response20 days ago\n\nThank you for your feedback. We are aware of this issue affecting the other players in the game and are sorry if this has thrown you off at all! Our engineers are working on a fix for this which will be released in the next patch, so please dont worry this will be resolved shortly. In this next patch, well also be fixing the calorie counter and with this, youll be prompted to enter your weight so were able to give you a better estimation of calories burned. Would you also be able to drop us an email at support@fitxr.com with some more information about the pixelation youve been experiencing and let us know when this happened and which workout you were completing? Id like to thank you as well for your feedback about the environment and the new explosive streak function and these have been passed over to the team. For the environments, we did only introduce one which were working hard to perfect. However following the feedback weve received, we are looking into the possibility of introducing different environments. With the Streaks, so we can work to give you the best workout possible, we've changed the way streaks are calculated with FItXR. For any cues you hit accurately these are converted into FitXR points which will change where you're at on the leaderboard and allow you to level up throughout the workout. The streaks that are calculated individually are now called 'explosive streaks' and to get these you'll need to get multiple explosive punches in a row. To get an explosive punch, you'll need to accurately hit a jab or cross at 3.3 M/S and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1 M/S. Since the update, however we have received a lot of feedback about these punches and how demotivating it is to lose a streak, so we are in discussions about ways we can improve this feature to keep our community motivated whilst still working hard.", "ngbf9321 days ago\nA step backwards. But there's potential.\n\nI was a big fan of BoxVR but I am disappointed with the FitXR update. Like others have noted, FitXR feels less fun, and I think there are a few reasons why.\n\nFirst, as others have said, the hit detection on crosses and uppercuts is a problem. I've been trying to figure it out but I can't seem to deduce why some swings register as explosive hits and some register as misses. If this is intended to demand precision and/or speed/power, then I would recommend adding an interactive tutorial so we can train and be instructed if we're swinging too early/late, not swinging with enough power, etc. Absent that guidance, we're left to do our own experimentation with swing adjustments, which was never necessary in BoxVR, and seems like it could potentially pose a health risk.\n\nSecond, the decision to count only explosive hits in the streak counter may succeed in increasing the intensity, but it does so at the expense of a more natural \"flow\" that made long workouts in BoxVR a more enjoyable experience. I like the idea of explosive hits, but personally would prefer to see them prompted --- perhaps by a different colored visual cue --- more intermittently and strategically, e.g. to punctuate the last 4 punches of a long combo, or timed to the biggest beat drops in the music. To throw every punch in a combo as hard as possible feels unnatural and more of a chore than ebbing and flowing along with the music.\n\nI do like the attempt at multiplayer, and it doesn't necessarily bother me if the player performances are recorded and not live. But I've yet to try a class where any of the other players actually completes the class; most seem to play only the first few minutes, then drop out, which negates the competitive incentive. I don't know if that's a glitch or a testament to how little other players are enjoying the classes. But if I'm going to compete against bots, I'd prefer to only compete against those that fully complete the class.\n\nThe good news is, despite these gripes, FitXR feels like it could be just a few key gameplay tweaks away from returning to the ideal mix of challenging fun it previously had in BoxVR. I am hopeful the developers will listen to the feedback from their longtime fans and deliver some updates to bring the fun back to this workout. The potential for a truly great game/workout is there. But until those updates come, I'll be spending a lot less time in FitXR than I did in BoxVR.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper Response21 days ago\n\nThank you for taking the time to review FitXR and were so sorry to hear youre disappointed with the new update. Youre completely right that an interactive tutorial at the start would be a great idea to help everyone get used to how the punches work. Just so youre aware too, jabs and crosses need to be hit at 3.3 m/s to be explosive and hooks and uppercuts at 5.1m/s. We have also received a lot of other feedback about the explosive punches and do agree that they need some work to make it easier to play flow better, so we are looking into how we can improve this and Ive passed over your thoughts here. Currently, for multiplayer each game is populated with up to 6 players who have previously completed that workout. We are aware of the issue affecting these players in the game (which causes them to freeze after the first track) and well be releasing a fix for this in the next patch. Im happy to hear that you can see the potential with FitXR. Were going to be constantly updating and improving the game, adding in new (and improved versions of old) features, so we hope that as time goes on, youll really start to love FitXR.", "daniel.jack122 days ago\nMUST REVERT to OFFLINE PLAY\n\nI tried the new FitXR update and ABSOLUTELY LOVE it but you need to make it like the original and allow you to play it offline.

I had used Box VR nearly every day, did all of the achievements, but eventually lost interest as other workout apps give me a different experience. When Fit VR unexpectedly replaced Box VR, I tried it out. The results are mixed but mostly positive.\n\nThe good.\n\nThe punching power index helps in motivating you to make a harder workout, which is very positive.\nI like the new environment. It is much cleaner. I understand this is a minus for some. A matter of taste.\n\nThe leaderboards have been removed, this is a plus because the prior ones did not work well with everyday use, I noticed some funkiness in the boards, which was demotivating.\n\nThe option to remove squats is welcome. I use it sometimes and having it there when I am not in the mood for squats is helpful.\n\nThe haptic feel seems better. Some have mentioned problems, but my impressions is that with the exploding visuals, the look and feel of punching has been improved. Again a matter of taste.\n\nThe not so good:\n\nThe multiplayer is now a joke. I mostly do longer workouts. Having everyone else quit 5-6 minutes into a 45 minute workout makes it clear these a prerecorded efforts not matched to each workout. This needs a serious upgrade to be useful at all.\n\nI bought the new upgrade, but I could not find the new workouts. They may be there, but should be highlighted somehow, so I could easily evaluate them. This was a facepalm moment, unnecessary.\n\nI could not find the quit button to exit the app. The button to get back to the oculus menu that works in other apps does not work some of the time in Fit VR, causing my to manually shut down the system, causing an unnecessary restart when I want to switch to another app.\n\nMost of these problems hopefully will be improved. Box VR was fairly slow to respond to issues, that were eventually addressed, gaining a five star score from me. Hopefully, they will fix these issues as well.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Olandersson23 days ago\nDowngrade and upgrade\n\nI loved BoxVR. When this update came through I was curious.

I love em, but not everyone does.\n-Explosiveness meter.\n\nCons:\n-Lag issues during songs that wasnt there in BoxVR.\n-Tracking issues, same as above.\n-Settings only let you adjust volume.\n-Loading takes a long time, both starting it up and loading into a song.\n-The colorexplosion when hitting, its just purely in the way. Give us an option to turn that off at least.\n\nI feel like they either tried to push through too much so the performance of the Quest cant handle it all that well. Or that they optimized the game poorly, at least worse than BoxVR was. My biggest issues with the update is performance related. Which connects with eachother. It gets even worse when you try to record or cast the screen aswell, to a point where the misses racks up to a level that makes me quit the game.\n\nI really would like different environments aswell, this current one feels dark and depressing to me.\n\nFitXR went from 5/5 as BoxVR to 3/5 now.

It made my workout fun!\n\nThe best things about BoxVR was the great wide ranging songs and number of workout types. Some were actually challenging as you became more used to the game. And best of all, it recorded your streak based on what you didnt miss! There were some great venues to play in as well, so the view rarely became dull.\n\nThe new FitXR has a better system for showing the stats during the sessions and the floating targets are a better design. But, the range of difficulties and songs is lacking. Theres only one venue, making the look and feel too one sided. And it doesnt record your hit streak, only the streak of power hits. The new power hitting is pretty cool, but to try and get a long streak is difficult without throwing your shoulders out.\n\nIf they could bring back the multiple venues, better song choices, better range of difficulty in the basic pack, that would make this game so much better.\n\nAlso, I purchased the extreme pack thinking it would at least make FitXR on par with BoxVR, but it doesnt.\n\nOne last thing, and this is a huge feature request! It would be great to have users make their own sessions and share them with the community!

Rebooted the game and had to do the initial start again and finally got the video. First class went great altho the block doesn't seem to work as it breaks my streak every time. I try it how it used to be, I try pushing my block like it's a 2 handed shove or something, I try my hands covering my face. Nothing seems to work for the block.

Maybe some weights, Pilates, yoga, things like that. Ive had a mom bod for the past 1.5 yrs and wanted to get back in shape. So, I purchased Box VR and its been such a great workout. I literally bead sweat. (I suggest the silicone cover for your headset.)\n\nMy suggestions...\n1. MORE ENVIRONMENTS: maybe something scenic like grassy field or something that makes you feel empowered.\n2. LIST THE SONG NAMES: Add the songs under the workout classes. Its easy to forget the class and whether I enjoyed it or not based on song selection and the workout. No hate, but one 18 min class had a church song and I know that can be motivating to many but not so much for me.\n3. GLOVE ISSUE: Ive talked with a few other VR boxers and they agree something strange about right uppercut move sometimes. Frustrating because Ill be on a perfect streak and for no fault of my own, Ill miss and my count starts again and that all throws me off. Idk. Still looking into that. Would also like to see glove color change options please.\n4. SOUNDS: Please get rid of the sound when you get 50 or something in a row. It sounds like I missed and it screws me up. Maybe a friendly sound or give option to toggle on and off. Honestly, I dont care much about score but that I did the movements. Its all about the workout.\n5.

I passed on this game so many times because I didn't think it was worth it, but come to find out it totally was worth the purchase. Although when I did get it was in a bundle so it was a win-win for me. This game does make you work up a sweat while you get a good workout. I've heard of people say that they sweat a lot while playing this and I thought to myself no way. I quickly learned yes it true. I haven't purchased any additional packs yet, but I do believe that their are enough classes to keep you entertained. It has really good music to box too.\n\nI will say that every now and again I may experience tracking issues with my gloves and landing a punch, but it doesn't happen often. I love having recommended classes each day. I wish I could find more people utilizing the multiplayer feature, I really enjoy that as well as working out on survival mode that's a lot of fun. I'm glad I get to work out, work up a sweat all while having fun. Some classes are repetitive but I'm ok with that.

I am always sore the next day after playing this. It really is a great workout and has fun music tracks to move to. But its a little glitchy in that every now and then it seems to lose track of the controllers and hits that I have definitely made are counted as misses, or one of the gloves will just start to kind of float away even though my hand is not moving that way. Its actually a bit funny to watch, but frustrating because it wrecks my stats! Overall I still recommend. Be prepared to wash your face cushion after use. Also in the future would be cool to get some popular songs to be able to download like Rock Band or Beat Saber do.\n\nUpdate: Ive played it a bit more and its still a great workout BUT- I dont know if game developers actually read these or not- in addition to that rogue glove that floats off on its own every now and then, some of my hits that CLEARLY landed my fist just goes right through the target and counts as a miss, seemingly at random. For some reason the block target is incredibly inconsistent with whether it thinks I hit it or not, even though I do the same thing every time. I just finished a session where almost none of the blocks counted, even though the gloves were clearly crossed on screen. Also, the dodge barrier is ridiculous. Unless youre Neo from the Matrix (spoiler: I am not) and able to bend your spine 90 degrees, even though it passes over my head, it counts as a miss. A hit? It resets my streak counter. This has been leading to me taking steps away from center while also bending over to avoid it and it STILL says I didnt dodge. To the point where, even though Im in a 7x7 play space, my grid shows up to warn me Im stepping out. And then I miss the next targets because Im way off center! Also, the hardware is not meant for head movement like that. I have bruises on the bridge of my nose from it hitting and putting pressure there, even though its tightened as far as it can be. Maybe my face is just too small? Either way, the angle of the dodge barrier is way too extreme and I saw other reviews complaining of the same thing. I have since just let them hit me but its so discouraging to continually hear that beeboop and see the streak counter reset to zero even though Im working my butt off. Despite all this, Im leaving the four star rating for now because it still is a great workout and Im hopeful that these things might be improved in the (hopefully near) future.\n\nHelpful | 3", "ToroTorc14 days ago\nGreat for exercising fun\n\nNot a fan of exercise but always loved boxing but never lived near a gym or a big enough places for a bag.

Also once in a while it completely loses track of the controllers so I end up punching nothing and have to reboot. I have not had those issues with any other games.

Yet A+\n\nClearly this is not meant to be a 'game' in the sense of other rhythm based titles - But it is SO much better than these for what it is meant to achieve and that is getting a workout from your VR - more so in a way that encourages you to keep at it! Sure other titles will get you sweaty at times but this one really gets you going! Nor is it just some shadow boxing, try doing that by yourself and will stop in no time whilst this encourages you to push along in time with the beat, moving about and striving to work on your completely arbitrary score. The real score is the calorie counter but hey, if it still keeps you in the zone the system works! :)\n\nSelecting session lengths that suite you and give back what you put in (i.e. don't gently brush the targets and wonder why your not sweating like some videos I have seen!) and you can use this title in a way that works for you. I now use it every day especially with the current Covid19 restrictions and its having a marked improvement on my health in only a couple of weeks - its way more fun than going to the gym which I gave up on much quicker and isn't an option now anyway.\n\nThe only reason for not having 5 stars is the DLC - its only 1 hour for 4 workouts - yet is 1/3 of the original price! :( The game comes with 21hrs and I have no idea how many workouts! Disappointing to say the least on that one and I wouldn't support this element.\n\nPs- Its not obvious but you can pause the game to have a drink, press the left controller button to \"continue\" rather than the onscreen options that only re-starts!

The sound effects and music add to the immersion. These combined elements help time pass by quickly on long workouts.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThere are tracking issues which can become quite frustrating. Multiple times during a class, one or both gloves (usually the right) will float away or drop. It is particularly discouraging when this starts to occur five minutes into a 45min workout, especially after building a hit streak.\n*I have tried changing the controller tracking frequency from auto, to 50Hz, as well as to 60Hz, with no improvement in performance.\n\nIn addition, this game crashes often. My wife and I take turns playing and it is routine for us to restart the Quest in between each session. If not, the game will usually freeze the Quest.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nI want to give this five stars, but the floating gloves and game freezing are huge pain points. If these issues are fixed, I will change my rating to five stars.

As a fitness program, it is 4.5/5, but as a game, it is 2/5. The tracking problems are too often, the biggest issue is lost track, and sometimes I can see myself clearly hit the target but it pass through. For a fitness program, this might be OK, as long as the user keeps workout. But for a game, these bad experiences are frustrating.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Breakfast_SandwichesJul 7 at 2:16 PM\nIt at least gets you moving\n\nI got this game during quarantine to get me up and moving. Its a fairly fun game, similar to Beatsaber in that its a rhythm game that rewards you for hitting all the things, except its not trying to trick you. But the thing is, its not very hard at all. Unless theres a bunch of squats, I barely break a sweat and find myself getting bored more often than not. I am not a very active person, I walk a fair amount in my job but other than that not a whole lot going on.

I decided to give this app a try as it seemed to be more of a workout app than a game like many others.\n\nThis app will make you sweat! You get out of it what you put in, so if you really punch and squat you will burn calories and feel the burn for sure. Most importantly, it is fun! Maybe all the songs aren't top 20 hits, but they fit the groove well and I often find myself humming along as I jab and slip.\n\nMy wife (who takes much better care of herself than I do) also gave it a shot and has been making it a part of her routine. You can create more than one profile to track your own usage, which is perfect for a couple or family looking to live healthier.\n\nInitially I ran into a few bugs that based on other reviews appeared to be related to a recent Oculus update (random black screen, lag, freezing). I contacted support and they replied within 24 hours stating that the fixed would be released that night.

Multiplayer: I'd love to be able to see and talk to the other person during the workout. It's not as motivating/fun to just see their score vs. yours. It would also be nice to choose specific songs during multiplayer, not just workouts.\n\n2. Workouts Descriptions: it would be helpful if each workout were ranked by difficultly and if there was a description of what it consist of. For example, I was looking for a workout that involved a lot of squats specifically and there wasn't a way for me to find this.\n\n3. More moves/left and right movement: The moves consist of punching targets, swiping left and right to punch, uppercuts, dodging barriers, squats and blocks by crossing your arms. It's good but can get boring after some time so I'd like to see more variety in the movements. Also, it would be great if the game required you to physically move around the room more rather than staying in one place (maybe targets could came to your left and right requiring you to move left and right to reach them). There could be some more uniquely shaped barriers to avoid (im thinking like in pistol whip where you have to duck and dodge walls coming at you).

However, there are far too many tracking issues wherein contact with the orbs don't register or the gloves are not properly displayed. At times, the gloves disappear from sight. It happens while all of the batteries are properly charged, the cameras are all clear and I am within the boundary. I don't let that bother me because I use the game as exercise, not to obtain high scores.\n\nHelpful | 0", "thetortoiseandiMay 8 at 1:51 PM\nNice for cardio, terrible as a game\n\nLike the title says, this app is great at directing you in a cardio simulation. If you are someone who cares about combo's or scores though, this is not for you. One of the major downfalls for me is 90% of my lean movements are not registered. I've even gone as far as step away from the lean prompt completely to see if it still says it hits me; it does. This just destroys a 200 hit combo and makes me infuriated with the workout, and working out angry because something you purchased doesn't work properly really sucks.\n\nAnother thing that happens way too often (at least once every workout) is I'll get a bug that makes my glove fly off into the level and then have to mash the oculus button. Or the screen will freeze and kick me to my home screen., making me start an hour workout all over again. And another bug happens whenever you try to pause the game. If you pause in the middle of a workout, the game will more often than not just keep going with a pause menu in your face and the only way to fix it is to restart your quest.\n\nTo me, these few glitches are game breakers and make the whole experience less than enjoyable. I would understand if it were a free app, but I paid money for this. I have at least a dozen games on the quest and a high speed internet connection (100 mbs) and this is the only game where I have these problems.

While exercising through BoxVR does not require an intimate knowledge of boxing, exercising through BoxVR becomes extremely more efficient with some familiarity with boxing.\n\nSUMMARY OF MECHANICS/DIFFICULTY:\nBoxVR doesnt really have difficulty levels. Its difficulty curve insofar as one exists is derived from {a} the users power and {b} the users form. While routines do range from simple to complex, difficulty is really a matter of whether the user can deliver a powerful punch efficiently. Consequently, users unfamiliar with boxing may want to familiarize themselves on how to throw a punch effectively. Unlike in Beat Saber where knowing how to properly wield a saber is not really useful to optimizing your exercise, in BoxVR knowing how to properly throw a cross, hook, and uppercut is very useful to optimizing your exercise.\n\nSUMMARY OF MUSIC:\nMusic is generic mix of pop, rock, techno, and etc (no popular contemporary music). Unlike programs like Supernatural or Audica, BoxVR did not splurge on licensing (hence its relatively low cost).\n\nSUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE:\nI exercise extensively (2-3 hours daily) through a variety of rhythm games. I generally exercise through routines on the highest difficulty; consequently, my opinions may not be accurate for routines on lower difficulty.\n\nHelpful | 1", "jasb18May 25 at 8:10 PM\nRoom for improvement\n\n...but still a good \"game\" for getting some exercise.

I appreciate that I can add another profile. The songs are enjoyable to box to. An overall quality game for anyone looking to get their mojo back into working out.\n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. Would love more color combos for the gloves and a new arena to play in.\n\n2. A free play area! A punching bag you can utilize. Sections of the bag light up and you have to hit it accordingly.\n\n3. When the rings fill up during a workout it would be cool to see something stimulating that represents youre at a high streak. It will keep the momentum of the player and will feel less likely to slow down in the middle of a 60 minute workout.\n\n4. Implement movement rather than a steady stationary stance.\n\n5.

I also have Thrill of the fight, and had Creed for a short while....but returned it. I get more tired playing Thrill because it's more intense...at least the way I play it, but BoxVR is more of a structured workout. It's not as intense as Thrill, but I feel like it's a more well rounded workout, forcing me to do squats and head dodges, where as with Thrill I can get away with less leg movement . I love using both \"games\" as it keeps things interesting and they both offer a great workout...if you put effort into it.\n\nI usually mute the included music and just play my own, not that the music was particularly bad, I just like to be in control of what music I play when I workout.\n\nI returned Creed because it's less of a boxing simulation workout and more of a arcade game, which isn't bad if that's what you want...and it was fun, but I use these boxing \"games\" mostly just for exercise and not for pure entertainment, so it wasn't for me.\n\nBack to BOXVR:\nWhen I first downloaded this game, it had some issues with freezing randomly when I would try to start some classes within the game, but I haven't had the same issue since the last update so I'm giving this game a full 5 stars.

I can work up a good sweat and burn calories and it's largely fun, but at the same time the app feels lacking in certain quality-of-life areas which collectively make a huge difference.\n\n1) Thankfully I haven't suffered too much with the crashing or tracking issues I see a number of others have (I've only had it crash a couple of times, tracking problems a little more so) but it's still not something we should expect from a paid title. I hear they're trying to work on a fix for this.\n\n2) The tutorial could really do with improving. It would help to explain/illustrate exactly what jabs, crosses, hooks etc are for those of us who aren't boxers. At the end of a class when the stats are given, I had no idea what some of the terms meant. Many months after buying this game, I found some instructional videos on the BoxVr website which helped explain. But what are they doing there?! Why aren't they in the game's tutorial where they can be of actual use? Perhaps even showing a trainer during the tutorial (similar to Supernatural) would be a help.\n\n3) The sound effects for when you complete a streak, when you miss a target and lose your streak, and when a class ends are almost identical. Mid-session, they are indistinguishable, and this is so frustrating. For a long time, I thought it was telling me I'd failed when it was actually telling me I'd done well. These sounds need to be changed in order to be properly helpful.\n\n4) The 3 not very high-resolution environments could really do with upgrading. Adding new environments (outdoor/nature, boxing gym, stylish apartment, space station etc.) would definitely add quality to this title. Whilst it wouldn't alter the gameplay, it would certainly improve the experience, which is equally if not more important.\n\n5) I understand getting licences for music is difficult and costly so I won't say much about it. But...y'know.\n\nDifferent developers have different approaches to user feedback. I can't say I've seen a lot of responses from BoxVr but if they do view the feedback at all, they could greatly improve their title and make it one of the gold standard in the growing VR fitness industry. It has tremendous potential and currently provides a good workout, but since its Quest launch, it seems to stand out more for what it lacks rather than what it achieves.

I would get tracking issues whenever I put my controllers too close to my chin.

I accepted that it's not going to feel like real boxing, but then I discovered that it doesn't have to. I ended up bringing in different disciplines and it worked surprisingly well!\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, for example if there are a string of left and right punches that aren't too fast, you can punch with a karate style. This is where your stance is more square and your off-hand returns to your hip area (to imagine this, picture what it looks like when Cobra Kai are doing their training sessions. Please tell me you've watched the amazing TV series).\nIf the punches come fast? Well you can live out your Ip Man fantasies because it's Wing Chun chain punching time!\n\nMixing it up like this has made it a lot more enjoyable for me.

When the game makes you duck and weave to lead into an uppercut for example, it feels great.\n\nThe music is a great mix of genres, there's probably something for everyone here and even if you don't like the music that much, the workout is fun enough to put up with it.\n\nI gave this four stars because there are bugs. It seems like this game has been out a while so I'm shocked that bugs this serious exist in a game like this. The first bug happened in my first play session.

Importantly, there is no tutorial on how to punch correctly. This seems like a dangerous oversight to make, should people start punching incorrectly and wrecking themselves in the process. Not to mention that using a correct form utilizes the whole body and would also result in a better workout. Also, I'm still not sure how the game wants me to block, as it frequently decides that my blocking was not successful \n\nThe sounds that the game makes are inconsistent (sound for hitting a streak and missing a beat are the same) and finishing a streak is realitively high and very demotivating if it resets because of the game not recognizing your punch or block correctly.\n\nAlso, I would love to have more customization options (like modifying the time in-between songs, currently the delay feels too long and I lose my groove) and workout details (what songs are included in a workout, what is the difficulty level of the workout and how many squats/obstacles does the workout contain).\n\nMaking your own playlist seems like a tedious job as well, it takes several seconds to play a song.\n\nOverall, this experience leaves me sad more often than happy.

PROBLEM: App crashes mid-workout, usually on the longer sessions (above 20-25 minutes) and usually around halfway to nearly complete. This means 20-30 minutes into a workout, the app crashes before the workout is complete and the player loses total time and calorie data, in addition to not being able to get on the scoreboard as the session was incomplete. This also means that any custom-created daily goals (a feature offered within the app) cannot be achieved in-game because the workout is incomplete.

Beatsaber is fun, this game is a bit more precise where latency becomes a problem feeling like you are just making disconnected anticipations to succeed. Nowhere near as satisfying to use your fists over sabers either, obviously, but it is more work out oriented than fun oriented. If you are looking for boxing go with thrill of the fight. Boxvr has me falling into weird habits and motions, TOTF definitely has mechanics that promote better posture and reactive motion. If you want something with a bit of both and dont intend to eventually get both, go for it, but my opinion is these concepts are better done separately.

The only issue is that the tracking can occasionally mess up. This is a fast game, and you move very quickly. Sometimes, I throw a punch and it doesnt register.

I would love to see more dojo scenery options too.\n\nThe issues: the game crashes and locks on a black screen often and I have to reboot my system. Some of the music is terrible. Don't mind some of the electronica stuff, but some of the others are just bad music. If we could listen to our own music, that would be even better. Racket Nx lets us place our MP3s into the Oculus music folder using the game's title and it works. No Sidequest or Dev mode needed. I'm sure the same could be done with this game if there was a chance to do so. There also seems to be an issue with the upper and side punches. It appears that the right (yellow) side doesn't register the hits most of the time, even after adjusting my controllers with the gloves. The left red glove does a better job at the hit detection, but both sides could be tweaked for better and more accurate hits.

Struggling a little with motivation at home & having recently got a Quest I researched fitness apps & opted for BoxVR to get my heart rate up & maybe perform a little upper body exercise.\n\nI found the menu interface fine & easy to navigate & jumped straight in with a 30 minute workout. I also recorded the session on my Apple Watch. The session was enjoyable & easy to follow though I struggled landing perfect upper cuts! Afterwards I was pleased to see that my workout had a average heart rate of 137bpm & a peak of 163, & that average is exactly where I want my cardio to be!\n\nFast forward to the next day & my shoulders & upper back were aching, in places they hadnt ached before, yet I was back in the app trying to perfect my upper cuts (which can take time)! Surprisingly I clocked up another 30 minutes of workouts without seemingly trying! Needless to say I am enjoying this app.\n\nMy suggestions would be more workout environments (one outside at least), a better tutorial for nailing the upper cuts & heart rate monitor integration & maybe improved statistics on the new so you can track workouts/performance over time. But definitely recommended to get your heart rate pumping & some muscles aching!\n\n** Update (2 days later) ** I have nailed the uppercuts now, whether its a timing issue or technique not sure but by my 3rd session I mostly hit them. As others have said it can be buggy. I turned off passthrough as if you accidentally turn on that during your session, your progress is lost, this is also the case if you go outside your play zone & passthrough appears both of which are annoying if your nearly at the end of a 30 minutes session.

HOWEVER, speaking as a game designer and a human player, there are some quality of life features that I'm stunned weren't in for day 1 and still aren't in now.\n\nLike I said a 20 minute session will leave me sweating - SOME 20 minute sessions. And I can't remember which ones unless I take off the headset and write the name down as I select it because there's no indication/ preview of what workout you're about to do (or have just completed). This is really frustrating especially as some of the workouts are pretty slow, just boxing, just squatting, or some other feature I'd love to know about beforehand.\n\nSecondly, create your own workout is clunky. There's again no way of knowing what box style you're going to get - the only option you have is to put together different songs and hope it works out when you press play - leading to a lot of standing around throwing your fist up once every ten seconds.\n\nGive us some song previews, give us scores and PBs, give us song difficulty rankings and show us what type of play it'll be - leg work, arm work, lots of movement.\n\nAs I said, great game, buy it if you want a workout, but don't expect to get something that feels like devs cared about it.\n\nHelpful | 5", "UltimateRRC123Jul 3 at 9:56 PM\nGood exercise\n\nThere could be an endless mode\n\nHelpful | 0", "flandersukJun 5 at 12:17 PM\nI love this game but reliability ...\n\nDropping another star.

Honestly, you should buy this if you're a quest user. Why 3 stars though... its reliability sucks. You just don't know if an exercise will lock up or skip/jump when you're in it. First 15 minutes you're usually ok but after that its hit or miss. Oddly it mainly happens when I'm finally getting a good streak of hits. Last night 1350 straight hits then it glitches and I go back to zero. Today 1500 boom black squares all over the screen, back to zero.

(Example: five to six different workout routines I've done, from 15 to 45 minutes the \"victorious\" song is there...and it's soooooo bad).\n- One song always will have the exact same routine, so it becomes monotonous. (And it makes me doubt about your \"professional personal trainers\")\n- the Extreme Pack it's way to far from extreme, there's some \"free songs\" more extreme than those. Put that money in the game thrill of the fight, it would last way more than this DLC.\nI will keep this review in 2 stars, because of the cost of this app and the DLC compared to my benefits.

I think it is good and I've enjoyed my time with it.\n\nBut, a lot of the songs and the maps are quite mediocre which can ruin the flow and cause some of the longer sessions to be a bit boring. It's probably a bit pricy for what it is and what is in the standard package. I would love this game if it had custom maps or fewer songs that sound like they are royalty free.

I love the outdoors and my only successful consistent workouts have been with things I can do outdoors, such as running, mountain biking, hiking, etc.. Unfortunately, I live in a place where for at least 4 months/year, doing things outdoors becomes hard because of the weather, but in general I coped with that. Only now, at the very start of Spring, we have to avoid the outdoors because of this virus outbreak.\n\nSo I turned to BoxVR, having bought an Oculus Quest specifically for the purpose of attempting one more time to workout from home and hoping I wouldn't fail, but I was sceptical, thinking this may turn out to be as boring as everything else I had tried in the past or it wouldn't be a proper workout. Oh boy, how pleasantly surprised I was to find I was wrong!\n\nBoxVR is really fun! I have been doing 30 minutes a day and I wish I had time for more. Not all of the music is good, but that's fine, it still feels like a fun \"game\", although it isn't really a game, and the workout is actually great, my arms and legs are sore as they should be and I expect I will start feeling stronger as time passes (I've been doing this for almost 1 week now).\n\nThe things I wish were better: I wish I had more virtual environments to work out from, and I wish there were more songs. But most of all: I wish I didn't have to restart a workout if I've paused. I've had to pause because of a phone ringing, or because my toddler walked into the room, or because I wanted to readjust the headset, and the game does not let you get back to the same workout. I guess is so you don't have an unplanned rest, to make the workout more effective, but the reality of life is that pausing will sometimes be necessary and it is really annoying that you can't carry on from the same place you were before.\n\nHelpful | 4", "JosianeDerzApr 17 at 8:34 PM\nFun but keeps crashing\n\nNo updates to be done, no other games crashes.

Can you make the game so that you can personally set a minimum speed at which you need to hit targets?

It's honestly just as fun as beat saber but I get more out of it. I kept going back and forth on whether I should buy this game because it just seemed like a basic exercise thing but it's actually both fun and rewarding. So far I like the music options better than beat saber and I get more exercise. This just might be my favorite Oculus game so far. If not then it's really close to the top\n\nReason for lower rating:\nMUSIC. While I like the music , you don't nearly have a large selection. It is extremely demotivating to hear the same music over and over again. Each music genre has about 6 songs. if someone only likes Hip Hop to exercise to, then they only have 6 songs to listen to. 6 song is enough for one workout so basically you would hear the same songs every single day. When you are not motivated, it's very difficult to want to exercise which defeats the whole purpose of the app.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Please allow us to preview music before choosing a class. When you click on a class, it should play a sample of the music. It's such a huge part of the exercise. When I start a class and don't like the music, I must keep searching and it gets annoying and time-consuming\n\n2. Blocking could be improved. Blocking should come from front, left and right. As if a boxer was trying to hit you from all sides which is what would actually happen. This would cause you to twist your body left and right in the blocking position to work your core\n\nHelpful | 2", "kadejitoMay 8 at 12:00 AM\nMore like BoxWU (warm-up)\n\nI really want to give this game five stars, but I feel there are several things that need to be improved:\n1.) The songs and classes need to be clearly organized by difficulty.\n2.) This game needs to be more challenging. It allows you to create your own playlist (only from songs included) and lets you toggle the difficulty, but even on HARD many of the workouts are soft. The Extreme pack that was released recently was a step in the right direction, but its not enough.\n3.) More customization options. More stages, more sprites, more sound effects. That scoreboard also needs a major overhaul.\n4.) Allow the player to create a playlist using songs from their own personal library. That was the most frustrating thing when I first got this game for my Oculus Quesr, that you can only workout to songs already provided with the game. Granted, some of the songs are very good, but this should have been an option from the get go.\n5.) I wish this game could hook up to a heart monitor so that I could see how hard Im working. Better still, so that the system could see how hard Im working and adjust its difficulty accordingly.\n\nI feel this game has potential, but as it stands now, after about two weeks the game ceases to be challenging and becomes more of a warm-up tool for more challenging workouts. After about a month, the stages and songs become tedious.

Definitely helps with motivation to keep going.\n\nFour stars because one annoying problem is that I can't seem to \"dodge\" better than 50%.

Previously I was using it for the days where I couldn't get to the gym, but with lockdown it's become a great way to get some exercise indoors.\n\nThe main issue I've had is crashes. The game image on screen will stop but the audio will continue and you'll have to restart the game. This has happened three times in a row about 30 minutes into a session. I would have said this was happening 2/10 times, but since the 'Extreme DLC' (it's far from extreme) came out I'd say it's about 6/10 sessions which is really quite poor.\n\nI would not recommend buying this game until the bugs have been ironed out, but if and when they are it's well worth picking up if you're looking to get some exercise indoors.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Harcourt.MuddMay 5 at 8:34 AM\nNo custom songs, bad hand tracking\n\nThis game does make me break a sweat and is okay enough to play for a workout.\nThat being said, the hit detection is off. I've tried adjusting the virtual gloves as recommended by other players on the forums but it still seems to miss some of the times I definitely had my punch there.\n\nMy second complaint though is there is no ability to load a custom song. While apparently existing on other platforms with this feature, it's not here for the Quest yet. Would be 5 star game with custom song options that allowed you to create your own exercises.\n\nDefinitely not worth buying the DLC. App is already expensive and not worth the full price. Developers should fix their system before expecting players to shell out for DLC songs. This is why they don't have custom songs, to squeeze you for more money in their busted product.\n\nUpdate - bought creed and thrill of the fight and haven't loaded this app since, much better workouts with a full boxing experience and working hit detection.\n\nHelpful | 2\nDeveloper ResponseMay 6 at 4:11 AM\n\nSorry to hear you haven't enjoyed BoxVR.

They need to make it so you can easily adjust the difficulty of each workout. At their current levels they are all too easy and will not get you breathing hard. They should also make it so you can target different body regions. Like a leg routine that has a lot of squats. A core routine that has a lot of switching from side to side. An arm routine that is like using a speed bag. Thats the way people workout. The new update music addons are insulting. One hour of new music (that you may or may not like- and by no real artists) with new workouts for $10. It doesnt need new music. It needs several workouts of varying levels for the songs it has.

First the positives. This game is probably one of the best workout games on the Quest. It was obviously designed with that in mind. That's good and bad, because while it's definitely more of a workout, its not as much fun as Beat Saber which is it's closest comparison. With Beat Saber I'll go play it just for fun and get a decent workout in the process, where as I tend to treat BoxVR as more of a traditional workout where I set aside some time for it.\n\nAnother big positive is that it's cross buy, so if you've got a PC that can handle it you can run the PC version via Oculus Link. This is a pretty big deal with this game as it turns out, because adding in your own songs only seems to be supported on the PC version, which leads me to my first big negative, no custom songs on the quest.\n\nA big negative (for me) is that I really don't like the included music at all, and no custom songs on the Quest. I know music is subjective, but the included music is just not to my taste. I get that the quest might not have enough horsepower to generate the maps, but why not at least let us port them over from the PC generated ones.\n\nLastly, and this is really more for the PC version, there should be more options for map generation for custom songs. At the very least give us an option for no squats. I have bad knees and the squats give me problems.\n\nSummary:\nPros:\nGreat Workout\nCross Buy\nCustom Music (PC Version Only)\n\nCons:\nMusic (YMMV)\nNo custom songs on Quest\nNot as fun as other rhythm games\nNeed more options for generating custom maps (PC version)\n\n\nBottom Line: If you're looking for a great workout, get it. If you just want to play for fun there are better choices.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI hadn't really poked around into all of the included music when I wrote this and some of my comments were based on the music in the pre-defined workouts, which I don't like at all. However it turns out there is a pretty generous amount of additional music available from different genres. I still prefer my own music though and use this pretty much exclusively on the PC version with virtual desktop so I can play my own music, but I don't think my initial review was fair so I'm bumping it up to 5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Bananamonkeyplayer17May 4 at 9:39 PM\nGreat subsitute\n\nIts a workout for sure!

If it wouldn't be so infuriating it might actually be funny when you lose your glove and it just keep flying off across the room when you're trying to hit something but sadly it does ruin the flow and just results in missing many targets that's not your fault but the games buggy code.\nSo better just pause the game - but oh wait often that just results in the pause screen popping up in front of the screen while the game is still continuing and more balls/hurdles are continuing to come at you.\nAlso if you wanna make your own Workout Playlist, plan an hour to do so because often loading to the music in the library to give it a listen to chose what you wanna pick might just take about 1min each, so bring a lot of patience or just go with the preset Workouts.\nBut if you have made your own Playlist, saved it and wanna open the game maybe on the next day you might be shocked about it not being there anymore, don't worry. It is - just restart the game and if the length is showing 0:00 just click on it and it'll show the actual length. Perfect.\n\nAdditional Note: This game would be perfect to use with bluetooth headphones (you can enable pairing those under your Quests All Settings > Experimental Features > Bluetooth Pairing) because cables are really annoying with that much movement but the sound of hitting the targets gets delayed so much that either you disable that sound or just go for the cable option, this isn't really the game devs fault but still - what I have also noticed is that the timing of the targets often doesn't even fit the music itself, that's a big difference to Beat Saber, so because making your own Playlist with the available music is such a pain in a*s anyway, I usually just put the Quest on silent and connect my wireless headphones to my phone and play music from there, this way you can also continue to listen to music and not have to wait a minute between the old track finishing and new track starting which also just destroys the flow for me every single time.\n\nOverall SOO much potential, SOO many annoying bugs - this would be understandable if the game would be new but it's been out since June 2017 so really WTF?!\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseMay 5 at 5:05 AM\n\nWere so sorry for your poor experience.

Many questions not answered which makes me feel like the developers do not have the answers. Surely you have enough people buying your game to update it with decent songs and not stupid rap songs that do not nothing to inspire you during training. I understand it will cost more money to get well known songs because of copyright etc, but who are these artists you have in your game? They are crap and the songs do not belong in an exercise game. Why dont you update the exercises they get boring when you have done a few of the same sessions and get very easy. Why havent you added more locations? Just three locations I am sure you can do better than that. Many people have bought this game and many more people will buy, but I really think you developers are getting abit lazy and do not update this game or add additional exercises and decent songs the way you should.\n\nI think this is a decent workout and I do feel the burn and sweat so it obviously works. I bought the 2 dlc which cost me 7.99 each and there are only 4 workouts on each DLC.

In that 2 + hour time, I've had the game experience a bug (at least 4 times, possibly triggered by head movement) in which the screen freezes then jerks around even after you stop moving, eventually freezing permanently and causing you to restart the game. Being a game based on working out and playlists this is especially annoying because it doesn't always seem to track your time when the game does this and you have to start your playlist/lesson from the beginning or choose a new one. The frequency of this has entirely prevented me from attempting a 60 minute lesson all at once because I'm nearly sure it will happen in that time\n\nGiven other reviews I'm seeing I wonder if this is only happening for me, but it hasn't happened with the other games I've played.\n\nMinimal nag:\nAs a game, I feel like it handles more loose than I would like, or at the very least I'd like a bit more input as to what constitutes a hit and I want to feel some weight of the hit. Vibrations were on during one lesson, but oddly haven't been on since, maybe I'm missing a setting or it's at the discretion of the lesson creator. I typically end my lessons with above 90% in all aspects, but I don't understand some of the misses that occur, I see my fist go through the object so it seems it should be a hit.

Multiplayer could be improved if you could see models of the other players, in-game chat, some interactivity with others, etc. The game itself could be less buggy too.

Considering how much they are charging, the included songs should not be generic stock music. Beat Sabre in comparison includes top hits as part of their DLC. The song quality would be forgivable if the workouts included anything new...but no additional functionality is included as part of the DLC.\nUpdate: After hearing from the devs regarding the ability to reset your position. This makes the app so much more useable. I've added an additional star. Unfortunately there are some inherent issues with the hardware that make it difficult to track hands close to the head which is the proper form when you're in your fighting stance. Not much the devs can do about this other than possibly provide a 'cooldown' in registering misses after the first one. This makes it less frustrating when tracking goes wonky during a densly notetracked section.\n\nOlder Review: The PC version of this app is absolutely fantastic. I'm a daily user and was excited to use this for Quest. Unfortunately there were quite a few issues.\nAs mentioned by others, the tracking was pretty bad, but I believe the user can compensate for this. The main issue for me is not being able to move my default position. This is an issue for Quest where there isn't a canonical center...so I believe the user should be able to adjust this in the 'settings' menu. I had one instance where the standing position was right at the edge of my guardian wall without any way to move this. Along the same lines, the settings menu should also allow the user to set a height offset due to the iffy nature of the Quest calibration.\nHopefully these issues get ironed out because the PC version is the best VR fitness app.\n\nHelpful | 0", "robashcorlettMar 27 at 9:47 AM\nLove this!!\n\nAs others have said the aiming and timing of the punches takes a bit if getting used to.

Imagine doing the 30 minute workout and 18 minutes into it the screen stops moving and never manages to fix itself so the game restarts. I wouldnt mind if it at least kept track to the point of crashing. Also, its extremely difficult to know exactly what kind of workout to expect and you cant favorite ones youll want to go back to.

The developers state that it's exercise for everyone so while they develop some boxing routines to have no squats, there are many sessions that have them with no option of removal. This does not provide those of use who cannot squat the same level of content that everyone else has paid for.\n\nTo improve access, would suggest:\n1. Height adjustment option (this would allow people to duck rather than squat; also when sitting, the low punches tend to hit the knees...)\n2. Remove squat option\n3.

Since I have taken a few classes on boxing for cardio workouts the way this game is programed just makes so much sense. (And to think i bought an actual boxing ball smh) This game is perfect for amateurs like me who just want to have fun exercising and hates running. (Like seriously who has time for that?!)\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to implement some training videos or maybe even have a trainer that teach you how to throw a punch and position your feet. (Kind of like how Supernatural does their tutorial, just don't make it as tedious and unskippable)\n\nHaving the proper form does help get a better exercise and plus you actually get to learn boxing through a game.

Lots of great stuff happening here and a few things I would love to see added or fixed to make this a 4 or 5 star game. As is now I have given it a 3 star rating and heres why:\n\nNo option for custom music. Quite a few of the songs are just not my style and are painful to listen to. The techno grunge poppy stuff is just cringe worthy.\n\nIt would be great if you can favorite the sessions you complete for the first time so that you can go back to them. But its currently not an opinion.\n\nThe guard color should be different than the color of the right hand punches. No reason why it isnt.\n\nWith a full battery in the touch controllers sometimes the gloves losing tracking even with a well lit room.\n\nFirst issue I had in the game was that it put me at the edge of my guardian putting me right up on the wall. No option to reset this. So you have to exit the game and readjust your position.\n\nSome of the combos dont make sense, like the quick double jabs. They dont seem to make sense and just add to the aerobics element to it. It feels more like a cat double jab lol.\n\nAgain with the music, there should be a room solely for hip hop. Its my biggest gripe so far with the game.\n\nOther than those things I still enjoy the works out because some of them are really great. Unfortunately you cant favorite them after playing them.

It is definitely capable of elevating your heart rate and working up a (lot of) sweat, which is obviously the most crucial factor. Its also quick to get into a session, and fun enough that time flies by relatively quickly when youre playing.\n\nHowever, it also suffers from some irritating hit-detection problems, and the scoring system left me feeling annoyed and unsatisfied. Visually its perfectly fine but nothing to write home about, and the experience lacks the polish and visceral satisfaction of some other games (e.g. Beat Saber and Thrill of the Fight).

It's one of the best fitness applications available on the Quest as it's useful for all ages and abilities. However, there are a few (minor) weaknesses that keep it from getting a five star rating:\n\n1) The biggest flaw is the clunky main menu design. The glove adjustment screen, for example, is seemingly inescapable due to the lack of clear exit instructions.\n\n2) The game could use a few more gym environments. There are currently only three, and one is the same as the other but with dimmer lighting.\n\n3) The game needs a more engaging statistics system. I want more ways to compete against myself. Being able to track my overall progress over time would be great. Show me a high score list and personal combo records for each stage before I begin. Alert me when I'm getting close to breaking a record in-game, or break a record in-game.\n\n4) It would be nice to be able to determine which courses have more squats/dodges.\n\n5) It would be nice to see a track listing for each course, so that I can easily remember them and add them to my custom lesson plans.\n\nAll of that aside, BoxVR has a solid core and I would highly recommend it to anyone interesting in getting fit in VR.\n\nHelpful | 0", "pcgregoryFeb 17 at 2:36 PM\nAwesome! Perfect excuse to buy a Quest.\n\nThis is without a doubt the best fitness focused game I've played in VR, it really feels like a serious workout, my watch tells me I'm burning some serious calories (more than the in-game estimate), and it's engaging, I actually look forward to working out, as does my 15 year old daughter, both massive fans.\n\nThere are some things that could make it an even better experience:\n\n1. The main complaint, the feeling of involvement isn't as good as it could be. When you punch the orbs, they just stop and fade out, with a number of some sort floating above them. The number is so close it's totally useless, can't read it anyway. The effect destroys the illusion of interaction. Compared to Beat Saber, where the cubes break and fall when you slice them, this gives a much more immersive and satisfying effect. I think it would be great if the orbs smashed as you hit them, and shot back in the direction of the punch, this would enhance the feeling of involvement immensely.\n\n2. The music, there is an amazing variety of music in here, something for everyone. The ability to make your own play lists is great, however, it's very difficult to find favourite songs. It would be great if, at the song changeover, the interface just showed you what song is playing in game. This way, as you play the predefined workouts, you could identify and remember your favourite songs. Also, why not show the artists? It would be really nice to know who the songs are by. Finally, I'd certainly pay for song packs by well known artists, that would be awesome.\n\n3. What on earth are the rings on the left display supposed to represent? I've been trying to work this out since I started, they don't seem to make much sense at all.\n\n4. Finally, the calories calculation seems to be way off. When I enable YUV in game, it's calculation is much closer to that of my watch.\n\nHelpful | 1", "rvrobertApr 13 at 4:27 PM\nGreat\n\nMakes exercising fun 30 min goes by fast.i hope there working on different types of exercise apps too.i definitely would buy.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Peiji.xoApr 21 at 8:07 PM\n\nGood workout\n\nHelpful | 0", "ByroGyroMay 2 at 8:41 PM\nExercise, Fun and Fit at the same time!\n\nIf the reason you bought an Oculus Quest was to get fit without going to the gym, then this is a first buy and a must buy.\n\nHelpful | 0", "H3rmioneApr 1 at 5:22 PM\nAwesome at-Home workout\n\nThis has been a lifesaver as we isolate at home during covid.

Personally, I was looking for something that would really get me going. And like most people, I hate going to the gym, I hate weights and I'm not so fond of machines. what this game does is it gives you a real workout, and I mean really real, in the comfort of your home. It's entertaining, the music is good and you really do have fun. I started off using the shorter routines but within a couple of days moved up to the 45 minute routines, for the sole purpose that I was really having fun exercising.\n\nNow; a couple of tips: first of all, it is not a fighting game, so relax and don't make it about power punching. This is about focus, speed and consistent vigorous movement. If you punch hard, you will become tired very quickly, so just try to make it about speed not power. Secondly, don't rush it trying to be accurate and don't stress over missed punches. Within a few minutes, you will have found a rhythm and before you know it you will be focused and more accurate and more relaxed. You will find that time flies and before you know it, your workout will be over, leaving you drenched in sweat. Honestly, out of all the times I have ever worked out in my life, this is the first time I look forward working out.

I played Box Vr for few minutes and realized that this was a mistake. Its SUPER S L O W on the hardest modes. I watched my heart rate and calories and I was burning as much calories as if I was warming up my rotator cuffs. Its a horrible game to label as fitness game. Buy this game if you want to stand up like an idiot and and throw one punch every 2 seconds, and if you want to gain weight.

Id happily use my computer to side load songs if that was an option.\nI would also love to see more arena environments. I want to box on a glacier in the arctic. Or in space floating on a platform. Or in the rain maybe. I dunno, I just get bored of the scenery.\n\nIm also at a loss when it comes to pausing the game.

And if u have found a training fitting for u, threres sadly no option to bookmark or favorize it.\n\nSo my wishlist for quality of life changes for the game is as followed:\n1. Give us a possibility to check which songs are in a preproduced workout, idealy with the option to hear a part of the song. Or at least show a overview of the music genres used.\n2. Please implement favorites. For whole workouts and single songs. The song could be liked during a workout after pausing the game. This would also make making ur own playlist much easier. Play some included workouts, like the songs u like and afterwards stick together ur own playlist.\n3. Custom Songs. From what i've read on the web, for the PCVR Version there was (or still is?) the possibility of using ur own songs. Would be really nice on the quest too :)\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJan 20 at 3:49 AM\n\nThanks for the review, we really appreciate you taking the time to get us feedback.

It would also be nice to be able to favorite some the workouts so that you can easily find them later. Regardless, this game is fantastic. I bought a Fitbit Versa 2 to see if my calories burned were close to the game, and to my surprise, the Fitbit registered 100 extra calories burned than the game (980 cals on Fitbit vs 886 cals on BoxVR) - which honestly, I thought would have been the exact opposite. The game/workouts are so fun that it really doesnt feel like work. Buy the game, you wont regret it!\n\nEDIT: updating my review to 5 stars after following the suggestions provided by the developer below. It seems that it is vitally important to stand exactly where the game tells you to stand, otherwise there are some hit confirmation issues. After making the adjustment, I managed over 1,100 hit streak and 100% on a few levels. Thanks devs!\n\nOriginal review: First off, let me say that I absolutely love this game. The music is fantastic and I get lost in it for over an hour every day that I play. The frustrating part, is that sometimes the block function and lean/crouch mechanics seem to not work properly. I have no problem with any of the punches, and Ive managed to get a streak of 500+ hits in a row, but then lose the streak due to a block or crouch not properly registering, even though I clearly did the move correctly. This of horribly frustrating and I find myself wanting to throw my headset across the room when it happens over and over again.

I know it's a workout first and a game second, but the game part still has to work well. Unfortunately I'm refunding this title after only less than an hour of play. Here's why:\n- It's frozen and crashed twice now. Once by starting the first workout and the other when I selected settings in the UI.\n- The hit registration is just awful feeling. I've tried moving forward, taking a step back, and adjusting gloves. Uppercuts and hooks barely felt good to pull off. I'd have no problem with this if it were just user error, but there's no videos or well made tutorials to show HOW to make the moves. Like a video would've sufficed at least. Compared to beat saber this feels unsatisfactory when trying to string together a streak.\n- There's only 3 workout maps which kinda sucks.\n- The presentation of it all could definitely be better, like the orbs you strike, the block cues, etc all look very bare and don't give real good feedback.\n\nIt's not all negative though, here's the positives:\n- A lot of workouts available and calorie tracker.\n- The songs are fun to play to.\n- This game will definitely get you sweating A LOT and you'll feel great after a few sessions. Loved that aspect which is why I'm disappointed in the negatives.\n\nAll in all, it definitely has a great concept and when it works it's great. But the polish isn't there for a $30 game.

I dont find tracking to be that bad, and after shimming the battery of my left controller, have found the controllers to be reliable even with intense movements.\n\nHowever useful it is, BoxVR has a lot of UI deficiencies that make it difficult to use. The workouts are poorly organized by time alone: there is no indication of their level. You have to go to https://fitxr.com/boxvr-workouts to find workouts at your level, and it is difficult looking at an iPad with your Quest on. You can build your own workouts using a bunch of songs provided by the game, but you have no indication about the level of those songs either! You can select a level (easy, medium, hard), but difficulty also depends on the BPM of the song (faster songs are harder, slower songs are easy even on easy mode).\n\nAs you advance in your workouts, the problem becomes more pronounced: most workouts become too boring, and the ones that are supposed to be hard arent really unless you count those with lots of squats. You can get more out of your workouts by focusing on your own form, but you might be stuck doing the same set of custom fast songs on hard everyday, it gets very boring.\n\nBoxVR just released new content as of 12/17/19.

Once I got past the fact the tracking is terrible, I have learned to adapt to the game to hit some of the targets.

The backgrounds, the tracking, and most importantly, the workout! The only thing I really wish was better were the song choices! Full disclosure, I'm extra critical of music because I'm a working DJ. I've been doing it for twenty years. I play weddings and other private events, and also play techno and other EDM styles at clubs. This absolutely does not make me an expert on music, but I have learned how to control a crowd based on which songs keep a momentum on the dance floor. Also, I do understand that because it's a rhythm based game the songs had to be integrated with the workout motions (I guess, I'm also not a game developer). Now don't get me wrong, all of the songs aren't THAT bad; they have all the qualities of a solid studio produced track that you would hear in a top 40 playlist. Unfortunately for me, most of the songs make me want to sit down! A lot of the songs start very slow, some have too many long interludes, and some are just plain boring and anticlimactic. I know \"to each, his own\" when it comes to music one likes, but if I'm working out I want upbeat selections that keep me going. I suppose since these are actual workout sessions they have moments where you peak, then cool down; but overall the majority of the songs just seem very 'meh', some of the sessions I can't even do because the music completely unmotivates me. I love this game because it is what it says it is; a fitness game, not a streaming music app. But I'm blindly hoping for some possible future updates that may offer new music. Maybe hire the guy over at 'Beat Saber' that selected those tracks, because those types of tracks should be on Box VR (*excluding the 'Imagine Dragons' and 'Panic at the Disco' packages.... Those are not bands to work out to either!)\n\nHelpful | 31\nDeveloper ResponseDec 3 at 3:02 AM\n\nThanks for the review, we really appreciate you taking the time to get us feedback.

If you are looking for feature requests - I would love to have a trainer designed workout plan for 3 months where I can track my progress. Either that or a \"Campaign Mode\" where you need to get a certain score to advance to the next workout. This would make it as much game as workout. I would also love to see DLC (I'd pay) where you can download new gyms instead of the 3 (which, let's be real, it's just 2).

Nope. Unlike even Expert levels on Beat Saber, this will take away your breath in minutes and give you a real, actual workout. Proper form is rewarded precisely (unlike BS, which is much more lax). Unlike Synth Riders, the punches actually land on beat. It's awesome. Yes, it takes some time to master punches and form and I wish the tutorial would go more in depth here to prevent new user frustration - because you not hitting isn't a bug (for once! in VR!), it's bad form, bad timing. Poise yourself for a general boxing experience, not creative flailing (which is fun to be fair, but not a workout) like in Beat Saber. BoxVR is a workout, where the rhythm is just one thing to keep you going and make punching air more appealing.

This is particularly the case with uppercuts for some reason.\n\nUnfortunately it also crashes frequently. Most days it will freeze in a jarring flicker between two frames, requiring me to force quit and restart the game. This is incredibly frustrating when it happens towards the end of a 57 minute class. It could also benefit from more stats, like individual records for each class, breakdown of errors (like whether you miss more left or right uppercuts).\n\nIf they could fix the stability problems, it would be a solid five stars.

I understand it rarely need to change once you set it up but it is a quality of life change.\n\n7. More background and skins.\nThe graphics on background and notes skins leave a bit desire compare to other rhythm games. And as a daily workout, you really want to have some refreshment once in a while.\nThe three background is basically two with one day/night on the same place and a cyber one. There is no notes skin implemented.\n\nThe background doesn't need to be too fancy or up close.

Im not sure if its the quest hardware or the port, but way too many solid hits dont get counted, sometimes dodge/squats count as misses when they shouldnt, and sometimes blocks randomly count as both a hit and a miss. Am I still happy with this purchase now that Ive bought the game on two platforms? Yes, its a great game even if its a bit broken. Would I recommend it though? Only if you cant get it on a desktop.\n\nDevelopers: add the latency slider from desktop back to the Quest version. Its REALLY needed quite badly. In fact, if it were in and it resolved the same problems like it did on PC, this would be 5 stars. Please be considerate of variance in tracking latency due to environmental factors as is always the case with CV object tracking and allow the users to adjust the latency setting to their liking.\n\nPotential buyers: GET THIS GAME! If not on the quest then on the rift or Vive, you will not regret the purchase. The game is a five star game in general that suffers only in its port or the hardware its on. I cant for sure say which is the issue, but of all the games I have on the quest, this seems to have more problems with tracking than any other, and so Im leaning towards thinking it needs some TLC from its AWESOME developers.

Tips for new users: adjust your glove position and watch for your gloves in front of you. It requires good form for jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. Your gloves need to be in motion as it touches the target. You also have to be in the correct motion for the target type. Take a few minutes and practice the easiest levels. Before long, youll be hooked!\n\nOne suggestion for improvement: give a video tutorial that shows what the punch motions look like and allows you to practice them.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Mandy9654Jan 16 at 3:45 AM\nLOVE LOVE LOVE IT\n\nIm not one to do exercise but saw this and thought i would give it a go.

I like this VR gamercise. It really keeps you moving.. the work outs are varied and tough. I see a few reviews complaining about the accuracy of the controller mapping. I think that's mostly incorrect. It's actually pretty good and I can't really find fault with it. I would say keep your punches short and shallow, you don't need to take as big a swing for the hooks and uppercuts.\nPositives are great work outs and the Music is suited perfectly for the work outs.\nWhenever, full body mapping is developed, this game will wipe you out.\nNegatives I would say aren't that much of a problem, maybe being able to choose your own music, and more varied workout settings. (perhaps that's an rewards/unlock feature I haven't got to yet.)\nImprovements I would maybe recommend for the maker:\nMore separation for the right and left punches. Have the left punches come a bit more to the left and the right punches come in to the right. They come in just a little be to much toward the middle than I think they should, IMO.\nThe tutorial could be a little bit more detailed in explaining the best motion punch the targets for each type of punch. Maybe add the function of running a free form training where you can freeform practice the punching at various rates of speed. have a basic beat playing that matches the speed of targets.\nChange the shape of the targets for the type of punch. For example have the jabs be square, have the uppercuts be a triangle pointing down (at the same angle the round ball does now) and the hooks can keep there current form. (or some variation)\n\nanyway I recommend this. it's a great work out and kind of fun and challenging.\n\nHelpful | 1", "tusamiMar 4 at 4:27 PM\nNot worth it\n\nThe moves do not flow with actual punching moves of boxing.

The timing of the game is different to what most people are used to. It's critical that your hand is still moving when impacting the orb.. just touching it will not count as a hit. Due to the fact that you need to actually swing to score, you have to start the swing early so you hit the orb in time when it arrives while you are still in full swing. For the basic round orbs, it helps to punch with the knuckles facing upwards. To block, you don't need to cover your face. Just face the backs of your hands forwards, and lift them slightly up.\n\nOnce you get the timing down, it's quite doable to get a 100% hit ratio on a song.\n\nHelpful | 1", "grizzlyvalJan 22 at 6:24 PM\nLove it!\n\nI got the Oculus Quest because of this game.

I also noticed that resting the oculus position mid game will also mess up the detection.\nSo yeah, once you look past that (that you pretty much have to reset the game every now and then), its a really good workout, when you need a quick fix and dont want or cant go to the gym.\n\nThen there are little things that could be improved : it would be nice if the name of the current song was displayed somewhere so you can easily find it again later if you liked it. Also, some song are easier than others, even on the same difficulty level, it would be nice to have any indication of that. Same things with coaches, you have a name and photo but no more info, and its hard to remember which is which\n\nHelpful | 2", "srtew37Dec 16 at 10:56 PM\n\nI really like the game and the workout that comes with it.

Taking sometimes misses especially upper cuts. Say my left foot is forward, I'm tilted right side which means my right hand is behind. So I'll have to wait for the ball to come closer to me to hit and most of the time it misses. I'll have to make sure I hit it earlier which gives me less score.

That with all the ducking and squatting makes for a real fun, sweaty workout.\n\nHelpful | 3", "TeeBaGMar 25 at 2:04 AM\nRhythm Game Rather Fitness App\n\nThis is more Rhythm action than fitness. The songs have clearly been transcribed to match the music which causes some major issues from a workout point of view. Firstly, higher tempo songs group moves together so quickly that it forces you into poor boxing form. You end up having to do more wrist movement than full arm and upper body workout. This reduces the effectiveness of the workout. The tempo of the songs makes for an uneven work out. Just as you start to get some high intensity work the tempo will change and you will lose the cadence. Also, the hit box and force feedback is all geared to rhythm action. If you hit the orb dead on you get feedback, if you dont then there is no feedback. Again, for a workout this will throw you off, acknowledge that I threw the punch and maybe display a %value for accuracy. The cal counter is very simple and significantly off. Again, the small wrist movements count as significant movements when actually your body is not exerting itself at all. This could be a great fitness app it they drop the rhythm action and transcribe the orbs more like a VR instructor. Maybe in the future, they can add a fitness option which contain proper workouts, and the music is there just to get you pumped up for the work out.\n\nHelpful | 1", "calforbJan 4 at 10:37 AM\nExcellent\n\nWant a good workout at home then this is great!

Yes, the tracking is still not 100%, but that can be forgiven given what this app is designed to accomplish. The included tracks and difficulty settings make this perfect for any level of gamer or fitness enthusiast.\n\nSome items I would love to see, which would make this the definitive workout solution would be:\n\n1. Include a 360 mode (i.e. Beat Saber)\n2. Ability to add your own music and have the beats analyzed to help with hit points\n3. Add daily/weekly challenges, including friend/custom challenges and leaderboards\n4. Allow for multi-height barriers (to allow for much lower squats)\n5. Add in the option for jumpable barriers.\n\nThat last one may be tricky to pull off, but for those extremely versed in VR, pulling off this action would be pretty simple to achieve.\n\nThank you so much for making working out fun again and for getting this 37 year old back into shape.

I come from a boxing background and had a short 8 fight career in the ring. The game feels fine and it does not have any tracking problems. I set my wife up on it. She is not athletic or a fighter by nature. She had a hard time landing the shots with a bad stance, technique, and timing. I can see why some people feel it's the game's fault. Practice and improve your technique. Watch videos or get with someone who can coach you on punching. This game will make you sweat, but feels like aerobic gym boxing by coaches that's never slung leather at another person.

It would be really enjoyable for me, if not for two issues:\n\n1) Tracking / Timing: For me it would feel the best, if the actual hits would time perfectly with respective music beats. However, it seems slightly off and the actual best timed hits would have to be earlier and further away from the body than expected. Compared to Beat Saber for example, you have to time your hits earlier and the window of time is very small. If the hitboxes get to close to you (but still clearly in front of you) there is no way to hit them. (-1 star) Since you can get used to this and the primary target for me would be fitness anyways (and not high scores anyways).\n\n2) Crashes (Quest version)\nThis is a real problem for me ( -2 stars). I cannot finish a sessions longer than 15 minutes, because after about 15 minutes every training session just auto-quits. The fact that progress is not saved is one issue, but actually stopping your workout because of a technical issue and then starting from scratch again with respective setup time is annoying and kills the fun for me.\n\nApart from that and if you have no issues with crashes, this game would be well worth the money.

After the first hour or so I almost requested a refund due to not being able to hit most of the beats. It was frustrating feeling like I was never going to get it. Then something really cool started happening; I found myself having to try harder, and to challenge myself to pay better attention to my form and how I punch. After repeated trial and error I started to see better results in my form and punches and went from missing most beats to getting almost 100% every time. If you stick with this game and keep practicing the payoff is awesome! After a half hour I have sweat dripping down my back. You will punch, squat, and dodge your way through an amazing workout. This app isn't for sissys who give up easily and complain about every little issue. It will reward those who are patient and can commit to a learning curve.

You don't have to punch hard, just make sure to add some force and hit the virtual object with the correct motion. On hard mode, there are many in rapid succession that will have you performing short and rapid punches in order to hit them all.\n\nAfter your workout, you get a percentage readout on all of your punches (hook, jab, etc...) along with calories burned.

I love the concept of this game. And I do play it often. It's one of my go-to's because I purchased Quest to get off the couch more often.\n\nI'd say the downside is that the workouts aren't designed around good boxing technique. The targets come way too fast to twist into your punches. And that's where your power comes from when you throw a real punch. This also encourages you to drop your hands low and to the sides, while in real boxing you want your hands up and ready to block and parry.\n\nIt also doesn't reward you for following through on your punches. So the mechanics always feel like a quick rabbit punch.\n\nI'm surprised by this because they engaged many trainers to design the workouts and I can't believe nobody mentioned this. It makes me question how much testing was really done. Have you played your own game?\n\nAll that being said, if you drop your hands and shorten your punches, the game is a great workout.

This causes hits not to register if the motion is that of an uppercut. If you're coming up from a duck and punching out at the same time, you may not get credit; same thing if you aren't keeping your hands up. The game is picky about what motions it will count as a hit and some of the faster combos make it difficult. It also helps to hit the target farther out because the motion is clearer. These are why people complain about tracking but tracking is fine.\nMy main complaint is that if I duck too exaggerated or fast, the geadset thinks I'm falling or something and cuts out.

They need to fix the timing of the hits. You have to punch just a tiny bit too early to hit the targets, which throws off the rhythm. This isn't the case in beat saber, so I don't know why it's a problem on this game since they're extremely similar. It'd also be nice if there were more than three (basically two) workout areas, and if you could set them to switch during your workout. A sixty minute workout can get pretty monotonous.\n\nHelpful | 5", "ThePeckSep 19, 2019 at 6:10 PM\nCould be much better\n\nThe degree of precision is annoying. I've played this awhile and it's just not good. Tracking is fine but you must be in motion the correct time to land hits. I found that holding my hands still and making small movements to hit it works better. Maybe I'm not a boxer and not good at it but when the targets get fast I'm just not fast enough to extend my arm as if I'm hitting and come back in to hit again. Resulting in many missed hits. Again maybe it's just me being older and slower. There needs to be, in my opinion, a little more range in landing a hit. Especially for someone that's not trained.\n\nBut after my gripe I do like it, I wish they'd add a couple more Tron-ish areas. I'd love that instead of only one.\n\nHelpful | 0", "gsowellozSep 7, 2019 at 5:52 AM\nGreat way to lose weight!\n\nI'm a two time owner of this game.. I have it on the PSVR and bought the Quest realising I would be able to take this with me where ever I want.. This is an amazing work out program.. I enjoy the music and have chosen different songs and lengths of routines for the mood that i'm in.. I do a quick half hour at work for my lunch break just to get a quick exercise in.. I've lost 15kg in a short period of time and find that this gets my heart rate up to an average of 140-150bpm.. I like BeatSaber for exercise, but this is a steady and guaranteed workout with no interuptions...\nAs with the PSVR, you have to adjust the gloves for this to work well..

Couple of tweaks needed.\n\nLet me start by saying I absolutely love this game. If you throw your punches correctly, have proper form, etc., you get an intense workout. Ive never liked the gym or working out in general, but this makes it fun and I look forward to playing and challenging myself each day. The different workout lengths and difficulties are great, and the three different locations are solid. However, I am hoping that more are added in the future. It would be really cool if there was a beach or other outside locations.\n\nThere are a few things Id like to recommend though:\n\n1) I see many people complaining about the tracking. My tracking is perfect, but only because I adjusted my gloves perfectly. You have to go into settings and do this right away or else the game will be a huge failure. With that being said, the first time you start the game, this setting really needs to pop up and be explained better so people know about it. Its doing people a huge disservice to not show them this right away.\n\n2) I think the above info should be followed by a brief tutorial that loads automatically, rather than having to find one on your own in the various workouts. Make it easy on people!\n\n3) Finally, I think it was be super beneficial to have a few videos showing people proper form to maximize their workout. Many people have never thrown a punch or done a squat in their life, and by showing them technique, their experience and results could greatly improve.\n\nAgain, outstanding game, but I would love to see a few of these changes made!\n\nHelpful | 8\nDeveloper ResponseOct 11 at 3:35 AM\n\nHi Hanedog - thank you for your feedback, we really appreciate it.

Every muscle in my body is sore, but over the last week and a half the soreness lasts a shorter period each time. This game is how I justified buying a quest and I have not regretted the purchase whatsoever. Even if the quest could only play this game, I would probably still buy it. It is important to note that if you are looking for a \"game game\" something like beatsaber would probably serve you better as this is game is more focused on exercise than entertainment.. this is not to say it's not fun just that entertainment value is not the primary focus here. Would hope the developer keeps supporting the game in the future with new tracks and workout regimens, and would love to see a tracklist and genre listing option in the workout selection screen.

No option to avoid squats (I have a bad knee). No idea what each workout is like (music, intensity, squat-heavy or mostly punches, etc.) until you actually play it.

If I had to complain about anything, the app does not teach you correct form so learning the proper stance and how throw these punches ahead of time is recommended.

Tracking can get lost, with a glove hanging in the air (but that's a Quest issue). And the worst are the crashes. It's bad enough that it crashes during a workout, it's worse that the calorie count and progress of that workout are completely lost, as if I had done nothing. I have found that once it starts crashing, restarting the Quest is necessary (so maybe a Quest issue), and sometimes reinstalling the app is necessary (but then I lose all data!). So suggestions as a workaround, to make the crashes less intrusive:\n- Have a thread during a workout that records current time and calories, and saves it every x seconds. In case of crash, the app can then restore the time spent and calories. Furthermore, since there are checkpoints within the workout (time when you move your feet), it could restart the workout to the nearest past checkpoint.\n- Or at the very least let players start at a given checkpoint within the workout\n- Cloud saving of data, so reinstalling the app doesn't lose anything\n\nHelpful | 1", "AngryCharlieJul 21, 2019 at 11:52 AM\nLove the game, dislike the tracking.\n\nHad this for a couple months now and I love the game but am not a fan of getting into a zone and having one of my gloves fly off or disappear.

BoxVR is a much better full body workout with the incorporation of squats. And the long sessions are much better for not having to stop in between songs. While Beat Saber is game first, BoxVR is exercise first. My one complaint is that you have to be really accurate to hit uppercuts and hooks.

I punch in what I think is in time but Im told I miss. It works if you hold your hand out early, but defeats the point of the music...If there was a way to allow a slider setting for punch delay (or the opposite) to hit the targets it would seem to solve the problem (If youve played the latest Guitar Hero it allows you to change your press timing with the beat to sync up your personal delay and this would make this game great!). Nevertheless, back to the game, simple but enjoyable to the extent you forget youre actually doing exercise (albeit the lag in your punches to the music as described above which is frustrating when you move out of time to the actual blocks). Theres great future with updates to this game and youll need a replacement foam padding once youre done as it does get the heart pumping (#sweaty! )...maybe one day theyll bring out hamburgers to smash, pizzas to block, or some other fun modifier such as holes in the floor to (pretend to) swap feet which would help burn the pounds, but until then, just 4 stars due to the punch early (before the beat) system.

With regards to the tracking issues I've encountered, they are frustrating and frequent especially when in the middle of a good streak. The most common and most jarring issue is when the glove appears stuck in a position despite moving the controller around. To be fair this problem is rectified within a few seconds, however because things get a bit intense in some of these workouts, this causes a lot of missed hits. Another issue that is also rather frustrating is how a recent update wiped all of my progress and stats. Besides these issues, BoxVR is a great VR fitness app.\n\nEDIT: With the recent updates for the app and for the quest, a lot of the previous tracking issues have been significantly mitigated and now this app is one of my favourites.

It can be hard to find good workouts too as there really isn't much info about each one.

Fortunately, BoxVR is a better cardio experience. By far, the cardio you get out of this work out is well worth the time and money. Therefore, if you already have Beat Saber and you are looking for exercise, I strongly recommend BoxVR! I love the display calories burnt during an exercise that tracks ALL of the movements during an exercise, even if they are not related to the objective. I found that time to calorie burn ratio is equivalent to an intense cardio exercise. During the exercise, the time flys, so it does not feel like a chore. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I think there is room for improvement.\n\nTo address VR tracking issues; when I first started, I had missed numerous hits for whatever the reason. Then I realized that the tracking is very specific. Meaning, it is vital to hit precisely as it directs you to hit. I definitely noticed improvement as I had participated in more exercises. However, be mindful, do not hold your firsts/controllers near your face, Oculus reported issues with tracking on their end when they are near head device. Also, in the setting menus of BoxVR you can adjust your gloves to fit your holding style of the controllers so that the hits in exercises are precise.\n\nMy suggestion to improve the application: (1) please display estimate calories burnt for each exercises, otherwise I noticed that 15 minutes exercises some stones yields less calories burnt than 8 minute exercises because the 15 minute exercises do not include dodge and or squats moves. Therefore, noticed that I waste time on exercises that are not as beneficial FOR ME. Maybe even adding an image of targeted muscles groups or type of exercises. (2) Also, I think adding jumping moves may add more to the exercise. (3) I noticed that the trainers that are displayed for an exercise dont actually coach during the exercise. I do not understand why their picture is even next to an exercise if they are not part of it. I wonder if adding a virtual version of a trainer mimicking the moves during an exercises may benefit better understanding and improve motivation during the exercise. (4) I have yet to participate in an online event but I wonder if it is something available more frequently with different goals.\n\nHelpful | 2", "FamiComplexJul 12, 2019 at 5:20 AM\nNo tracking issues - A few pointers.\n\nI just purchased the Quest version of the game after having played on Steam for quite a while, and there's no real difference between the tracking on the two. It is working entirely as expected.\n\nSome important things to remember for a good experience with this game:\n\nFirst, follow the directions. Always be in the stance the game requests. Not just the direction you're facing - take a boxer's stance.\n\nSecondly, box. This isn't a rhythm game where you're concerned about high-speed taps for score, this is a workout. So, when you're punching, punch for real.\n\nLastly - and this is the one that threw me the most when starting out - the uppercuts and punches to the sides. Yes, they're hard to land at first. The thing is, in VR you're used to getting big results from tiny movements, so you FEEL like you're doing a huge uppercut but you aren't. Reset your brain on these. Take what feels like a huge, sweeping movement - uppercut like you're in slow motion in an action movie - but make sure your glove is in the hit zone at the end of the movement. Scale back the ridiculousness of the movement as needed until you're consistently getting the hits.\n\nAbove all else, enjoy your workout!

While playing, my gloves will often stop tracking and stay in one place or float off to the opposite side of the screen. Other times they won't move until just the moment before impact, which makes for a very disorienting experience.

That said, it only forces you to commit to form while playing and boy does that burn calories. I have lost 45 lbs doing this, running, doing some bowflex and watching the food a bit.

As far as tracking, don't know if the developers can fix the issues. For me, my right-handed glove misses quite often and I don't know if that's a function of the right controller or another mechanic and it will also get stuck in mid air at times. This in turn ruins the whole experience of it all.\nHowever, I did find the \"adjust gloves\" feature in the options helpful since it increased the accuracy of my hits once properly adjusted. Took me some time to figure it out, but just make sure your controller matches your gloves in how they are oriented.\nAgain, loving this app but can't wait for improved tracking and possibly more workouts. An increased tracklist would also do wonders for replayability.\n\nHelpful | 7", "MountainPieJun 25, 2019 at 6:55 AM\nGreat work out alternative\n\nVery fun way to finish my calorie goal at the end of the day ( I assume 2/3 of what it says).

Adjusting glove position does not help with this problem. I am surprised there are not a lot more people commenting on this serious issue - no doubt there will be, once more play it in-depth at higher speeds.

Rather, It should be on neutral level, in front and just below your chin: ready to block, uppercut, jab, or swing. I think they designed it this way for the game to be played properly.

I was thrilled to see it was available on Oculus Quest and the fact that I didnt have to repurchase it helped push me to buy the Quest.\n\nThe gameplay and visuals overall are great - the developers did a really nice job on porting over the experience from Rift and keeping all the important events in place. However, this IS a boxing game and if you stand in guard position, gloves up and near your face, theyll lose tracking and just seem randomly placed. Its VERY distracting, but doesnt stop you from playing - tracking picks up as soon as you move your hand out to punch.\n\nMore than likely this is a mixed issue; probably a limitation of the proximity of the controllers to the headset, as well as the app logic. For example, a work around in the software mingle be to look at the last known track position and if moving towards the visor, default to a reasonable default guard position instead of it feeling random.\n\nHopefully these are just early days growing pains for the platform and refinements to the SDK and application tweaks can resolve these sorts of issues.

I'm a sweaty mess after a few minutes - which is exactly what I wanted. However, there really is something a very wrong with the timing. Beat saber is flawless in its 'feel' of timing your swings to the music. BoxVR just feels wrong. I have learnt to ignore the beat of the music as its not perceptually matched to the graphics and useless for timing my punches. It feels unnatural so I have learnt to focus on the graphics and not get distracted by the beat.

I would do the same motion on a combo that had me doing multiple of the same hit and sometimes the glove would disappear and not register the hit. It only happened with the right glove, and was very infrequent.

The quest will lose track of your hands if it's too close or out of sight and will make the gloves appear wonky, but it will quickly regain tracking once you punch. It also helps if you put a little distance between your hands and headset when waiting to punch instead of sticking it right to your face.\n\nI think the problem most people are having is due to half hearted punching and timing or at least that's what my problem at first. You have to punch properly and do a full straight quick jab and swing fully when doing hooks and uppers, and it has to be a straight up quick and not a half hearted one like you forgot to have breakfast. Do this and I swear you'll enjoy it better.\n\nPrice is a bit steep I think but definitely keeping the game as I can see myself using this quite often.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Spartan-NowJun 22, 2019 at 8:32 PM\nTracking and Lag are serious issues\n\nI love the concept of this game, but there are significant lag and loss of hand tracking issues. Ive done a lot of boxing, and when throwing hooks or uppercuts, its just impossible to land them on beat due to the lag issues. They just never seem to connect unless you go significantly offbeat which is hard to do. Also, with boxing, the hands should be close to the face (to protect yourself) but when doing that with this game, tracking is consistently lost and the few seconds it takes to get your hands back is jarring. Unless you keep your hands out in front of you, which is contrary to real boxing, it just doesnt work. Maybe Ill try again after improvements are made, but for now, its too troublesome to enjoy.

But it's starting to get borderline unplayable as you start to hit the higher paced levels as a movement as simple as winding up to get a swing, the tracking drops, & once you're in rhythm and that happens, you're thrown out of rhythm immediately - not fun in the midst of a deluge you know you're nailing. Anyhow, I may just hold out until the 13th day of my refund period and see if a quick update is released. If not, I'll probably be releasing this game until it's fixed & come back then. I've also regrettably downgraded from 4 to 3 stars for now...PLEASE FIX!)\n\nOriginal Review:\nThe game itself is a LOT fun. Yeah, some might compare it to Beat Saber, and truth be told, the developers would probably be lying if they said they didn't draw at least some inspiration from it, but this is a whole other beast unto itself. It's much more of a workout and had me legitimately sweating and huffing and puffing after several 7 minute rounds (yes, that's a good thing...).\n\nHowever, it DOES need some help in the tracking department.\n\nI don't know if there's a way to utilize a wider angle of the bottom tracking cameras, but the glove gets lost and ultimately end up missing several punches you'd actually land in real life if you move your hands just below eyesight. I know the workaround that's been suggested below is to hold the hands further in front of your face, which absolutely helps in registering landed punches better, but also just as absolutely feels much less natural from a real boxing stance.\n\nIn any case, the game is super fun, and I will be keeping it with the hopes that the tracking issue is somehow resolved in a future update/patch. If that happens to be the case, I've no problem upgrading my review another half star.
