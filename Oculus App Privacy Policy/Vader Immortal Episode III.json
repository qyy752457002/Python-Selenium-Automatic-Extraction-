That would have been in 1985, when the Atari would have been the king of home video game consoles. How things have changed!!!!\n\nFirst, the developers nailed the story mode. You want to feel like you are actually a character in a Star Wars movie?? You want to face Vader in a climactic showdown? You want to learn force powers from Vader himself???? This game gives you everything that you want!!!!!! This is the first and only game that I have lost myself in. I just totally gave in and I was there with these characters.\n\nSecond, the gameplay mechanics are wonderful. Holding the Quest controller is a bit like the hilt of a sword so it feels very intuitive and the light saber really feels connected to your body.\n\nThird, the Jedi Training room IS the major feature of the game. Wield 2 light sabers, use the force to throw things, robots, or people around. Choke enemies. Throw your light saber around like a boomerang while force throwing storm troopers with your other hand. Just amazing. Feel like a powerful jedi who can wreak havoc on an army singlehandedly. Try out Darth Mauls two sided saber that looks really cool but is apparently not very useful...haha.\nSometime in the middle of the dojo levels....something special and amazing happens. I wont spoil it but i am pretty sure i squeeled when it happened.\n\n4th, actually the game looks great. I am not sure how they are doing this on a mobile processor....But it works.\n\n\nDevelopers: PLEASE PLEASE MAKE MORE. There is plenty of material to mine for more star wars stories. The quest was built for star wars. I have this game for 7 months now and still play the Jedi Training room at least twice a week. It's just too much fun. But I need another story to be a part of. Do It!!!!\n\nHelpful | 126", "LuigiRocks9517 days ago\nAn Addicting Piece of Art.\n\nThis review is for all 3 episodes of this entire series, so bare with me please:\n\nThis. Game. Is. A. MASTERPIECE! At first I wasnt a massive fan of Star Wars. Then I played this. Then watched all of Star Wars. This game is so good, it causes you to become obsessed with the Star Wars franchise. And the lightsaber dojo is the BEST! There is so much to defeat and many lightsabers to unlock. That is probably the most addicting part of the game. But I have an idea that can possibly help this game be very, VERY successful. And that is a Sandbox mode. The ability to go to different places in the story and be able to go to an arena (like Blades and Sorcery) and fight different waves of enemies of your own choice. Just an idea to play around in this game more, though. Great job with all three episodes, and I would love to see my idea. Thanks for making and your welcome for playing!\n\nHelpful | 10", "Toby123rJul 23 at 3:30 AM\nVery Very good\n\nOk so this game is one of my favourites. Ive played it a lot since I got it with the headset. I like the story but what really makes it better is the dojo. All the lightsabers from all the movies make you feel like one of the characters and thats what should be in any game that wants to excel.\n\nDevs:\n\nThe dojo is the best part of the game, it would be so much better if you added like a lightsaber customisation option where you can change your lightsaber rather than the pre-sets. The combat would be a lot better if you added human opponents like in the last level we could duel any villain or hero rather than robots.\n\nLike so the devs see it\n\nHelpful | 12", "Chiss976May 25 at 1:43 PM\nBest of the 3\n\nIf you were to get one of the three Vader Immortal games in the series, this one gets the most out of your money, the end of the story is pretty cool. This one definitely has the best dojo too. It combines the first and second to create an amazing game-mode. On the Quest, every once in a while there will be a split second where the audio breaks with a weird digital sound, but it isnt annoying, this game is amazing and definitely worth buying.\n\nHelpful | 84", "Artdracula2 days ago\nGreat but short\n\nReally immersive experience, definitely worth $10. The only negative thing I can say is how short this game is (45 min roughly) with that said there are a few stages that definitely have replay value even just to go back and play that specific level. I wish the 3 pack was combo at 19.99 at that price no brainer.\n\nHelpful | 0", "zeus23264 days ago\nUr a sinner if u dont play this game\n\nAbsolute masterpiece of a game. Its everything I've ever wanted from a star wars vr game and more. I feel especially achieved after fighting vader (spoiler alert). One thing I ask for now is a sequel game to this or a follow up style game that's maybe a bit longer and not split into different games. Maybe with the ability to build ur own saber. But other than that I dont really have any complaints. Definately a must have and I highly recommend playing it\n\nHelpful | 1", "lamahunter3 days ago\nDADDY  VADER \n\nPapa Vader does it again with the added bonus of freaking pistols and grenades and whole storm troopers to force chose while impaling them with sabers. While the story is amazing, the pice de rsistance is the lightsaber dojo. Containing everything great about the previous titles and adding onto it with more lighsabers, enemies and UNLIMITED POWER do yourself a favor. Quit your job go home buy the game play the 1 hour story wash, rinse and repeat. Worth any job ever.\n\nHelpful | 0", "xxd3pthxxJul 27 at 5:09 AM\n\nGreat game, would love another series of games but a few things, I would make it so you can replay the game with a different lightsaber or something else. Another thing would be I would add something like a boss to the lightsaber dojo or a never ending mode but other than that 5/5.\n\nHelpful | 3", "molson177810 days ago\nA Great Star Wars Experience!\n\nPlaying through all three episodes of Vader Immortal I was definitely pleased by the story mode, lightsaber combat, and force abilities! The very first Vader immortal introduced us to the satisfying gameplay of a lightsaber and the second offered us force powers in which we have never been able to use in VR before. The Third game takes these two positive traits and Irons then out to a teat. Only issue is that sometimes when I use the force it wont register and Ill end up dead, please look into it.\n\n-Michael\n\nHelpful | 0", "Kronox211 days ago\nAmazing.!\n\nI loved this. The best experience I ever had in VR. I wish the games were longer and definitely hoping for more Star Wars VR in the future. I wish you could have 2 lights ayers, more force powers and a co-op mode. This has me looking forward to the future of VR and has made me want to play SWTOR more.\n\nHelpful | 1", "rockwithtime3 days ago\nWouldnt buy myself, but very fun\n\nIm not a huge star wars guy but regardless i still had fun playing. Personally i wouldnt spend the money on this because im not that into star wars. The series came with my quest purchase and im happy it did. If you like star wars and are intrested in this game i recommend it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Jeff_013511 days ago\nBRING AN EPISODE 4!!!\n\nPlease creators, an you make a episode 4 of this series. This is one of my favourite games, PLEASE BRING MORE!\nI have loved Star Wars for so long.\n\nCan we have another one maybe even with Luke and the emperor Palpatine!\nI love the way all the games have been created I would love to have more!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Jteale05Jun 25 at 11:56 AM\nAmazing!!\n\nAs a big star wars fan this game is very pleasing. Just holding a lightsaber in VR like this is insane and the combat isnt controlling and the enemies are a good balance of easy and impossible to kill. if you like star wars or simply want to have some fun then you should download this. My best VR experience yet .\n\nHelpful | 9", "XFRONIX14 days ago\nVery well done\n\nThe creators really nailed whats its like to be a jedi, its so cool and accurate. I wish there was more done with this game, like an online lightsaber duel 1 on 1, or against a bot. I do enjoy the fact that I can be like real star wars charecters since you can unlock their lightsabers. If your trying to debate getting the game, just trust me, its worth it. The story mode is really pleasing and you can fight with lightsabers, guns, and grenades. It is very fun is what im trying to say. Thank you.\n\nHelpful | 1", "udo.nink12 days ago\nI am totally biased\n\nEnd of last year I thought my Star Wars journey was over having seen all episodes when they came out in cinema, got them all, case close. But, it isn't, the story continues. Being Vader with the force and a light saber and other thingies. So vreal, I love it and I have just begun. Earns an extra star for the low price. Otherwise priceless.\nI told you I am biased, but it really deserves it.\n\nHelpful | 0", "TattenRatten17 days ago\nAMAZING!\n\nI am a huge Star Wars fan, and this series took me with storm. The game mecanics are awesome, and the feeling of blasting down an AT-Walker with a turret and cutting down stormtroopers is totally worth 10 bucks.\n\n\nAfter finishing the story, you can cut down droids and stormtroopers in the lightsaber dojo. You can unlock new lightsabers of different types and colours.\n\nIf you love Star wars, this is definetly worth a try.\n\nHelpful | 0", "choogurr16 days ago\nAmazing\n\nThis game is kind of short but you can play the training mode. In the training mode you complete levels and gain stars with those stars you get to unlock different lightsabers. Right now I have qui gon's 2 obi wans darth maul anakins first light saber both of ahsokas mace windu and count dookus\n\nHelpful | 0", "423barkeep17 days ago\n\nThis game is exactly what you want. A chance to fight in lightsaber battles. This is the third episode as far as the story, but the real fun is in the lightsaber dojo. The levels get really exciting and it stays rewarding as you unlock certain perks, different gloves and different color lightsabers, duel weild, etc.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Leo_Katu17 days ago\nBest Lightsaber game! Period\n\nThis game started off decently already. The story was really interesting, being in a spot where your being forced to work with Baver only to fight him in the end. I'm happy the fight was what you expected. I won't spoil anything for new people but this game has an amazing story along with the dojo. Which is BY FAR the best part of the game. I love this game with a passion.\n\nHelpful | 0", "RolandMcDolanJun 25 at 6:00 PM\nEasily the best of the 3\n\nI think the saber Dojo makes this game shine, the other episodes are worth buying to experience the story but I wouldnt bother keeping them installed beyond that, the saber dojo is everything in this game and I find myself coming back to it constantly trying to unlock all the awesome move lightsabers, something about holding them and getting to use them, inspect them up close, is a real dream come true for me, especially since I dont have the money to shell out 100s of thousands of dollars for actual lightsabers from custom saber shop!\n\nHelpful | 7", "GibbyDaGamer153 days ago\nAwesome game!\n\nThis game is super cool and fun. The final final fight with Vader was a bit disappointing. It was just too easy! And short! But other than that, the dojo is super fun, and the story is too! I recommend buying it!\n\nHelpful | 0", "CorkCylinder73722 days ago\nGreat finale\n\nThe story was amazing. *Spoiler alert for those who havent played it yet.* I get to fight Darth Vader face to face. Kind of short but great climax. It kind of left a feeling of suspense because you dont really know whats going to happen to the smuggler and his/her droid partner. After all, this is a great game. I would highly recommend this ( and the other two episodes) for any Star Wars fan who wants to face Darth Vader.\n\nHelpful | 1", "RoreoOreo10 days ago\nAmazing\n\nI have played all the games in this series and they were all amazing. I started playing this series after I got pretty settled into vr and yet it was so amazing I dont even like Star Wars that much would definitely recommend\n\nHelpful | 0", "McGuffyFL10 days ago\nPhenomenal storytelling in VR\n\nOnce I accepted that these arent games, theyre interactive experiences, the entire series really shined. An absolute must have for any fans of the movies. This is one I have new VR users try, and theyre blown away.\n\nHelpful | 0", "NO-A17 days ago\nA quick End.\n\nI felt this one was almost painfully short.\nI had a discount voucher so I didn't feel so bad about it. But after Part 1 I need say the others were a lot shorter. At least I felt that way.\n\nIt's a pity as the Story was interesting. And the gameplay quite fun. It's worth to replay as well.\n\nThe inly thing that makes the full price more tolerable is the Dojo. The Dojo in Episode 3 is great with all the new challenges and skills.\n\nIt's really good but leaves for wanting so much more. If they had put all 3 games together for one smooth play through it would be much more enjoyable and worth.\n\nHelpful | 1", "LoraleiBJul 1 at 3:38 PM\nSeason 2?\n\nLook, the Vader Immortal series is amazing! I love how we actually are put in a first person view of the main character! This does indeed look like the last episode of this series. Will there even be a Season 2? If there would be a season 2 with different main characters, I would definitely be getting it. This game is highly recommended you get.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Berg4quest5 days ago\nLoved this game!!!\n\nThis game was fun for my whole family. We played all three episodes and enjoyed them all. If only there were more games like this. Nothing has come close to this so far..\n\nHelpful | 0", "rc_blocker11 days ago\nCoolest moment ever\n\nFighting Vader as a Jedi will go down as one of the coolest gaming moments Ive ever had. The light saber Doja three is masterful with all of the combinations you can do to take down your enemies.\n\nHelpful | 0", "LookinSharp9898Jul 22 at 6:08 PM\nAwesome\n\nGreat but I do suggest something to add. Now I know my words dont mean anything but hear me out. What if you add a game mode where you move through a Labyrinth and take out enemies as they come at you. The light saber dojo is fun and all, but it seems more fun to run around and throw a light saber and slash enemies on the run. I know this game had been out for awhile and this may seem small but this is something I would really like to see. Thanks\n\n10/10\n\nHelpful | 1", "datboi18819 days ago\nIts the best not joke\n\nI might be exaggerating but this is the best game even if you didnt play the first two. The dojo had many lightsabers and the actual game is fun\n\nHelpful | 2", "BeastlyBoy9518 days ago\nAMAZING MUST BUY\n\nThis game is awesome and is so fun especially the duel with Vader near the end and the new updates dojo with new sabers and even force lightning and ability to use a blaster and thermal grenade\n\nHelpful | 0", "MadHatter42Jul 16 at 1:28 PM\nAMAZING!!!!!!!!\n\nI havent even gotten to the story line yet!!! I check out the dojo training first in each of the episodes. So far this one is the best, and I liked the other two. The rewards are awesome. I really wish the story line in each episode was longer. Takes me maybe half an hr to get through and its not something you would play over and over again. So hopefully this one is a bit longer. But either way the dojo training makes this a must have. Oculus please please please come out with a multi player Star Wars game. It would be so cool to battle the dark side as a team. If your a Star Wars geek you must add this to your collection.\n\nHelpful | 1", "CaptainMcDonutsMar 14 at 1:44 PM\nMore Lightsaber Dojo\n\nThis is a must buy game for all Star Wars fans. Its not a game, it is an experience. The campaign is amazing, but the star of the show is the lightsaber dojo. Honestly I think that this could be its own game. Just a few more lightsabers (like the dark saber) and maybe more robot sparring. I would totally buy this game for like $20.\n\nSome ideas I have:\nHave more legacy lightsabers including the dark saber, Ezras saber (with blaster), Kanans lightsaber, and Snokes guards light weapons.\n\nCustomizing lightsabers (like in Savis workshop) where you unlock a Kyber crystal, different body pieces,and different body types, including regular, curved, collapsible (like in the trailer of rise of Skywalker), cross guard, and double bladed. You would also be able to select features, like dual wielding, blade length, and maybe others.\n\nNot just lightsabers, but target practice mode with the blasters, or only force mode where you have to hit enemies with rocks and other objects.\n\nLots of different force abilities, like lightning, or healing.\n\nDifferent dojos in famous locations like the Lars residence, star destroyer bridge, Jedi council chamber, inside the Millennium Falcon where Luke trained with Obi-Wan, Dagobah, the arena on Geonosis, Kashykk, Mustafar lava flats, Castle Vader, Naboo power generator room (where Darth Maul battled Obi Wan and Qui Gon), the surface of Star-Killer base, Supreme Chancellor Palpatines chambers (where he battled Mace Windu), the senate chamber, the maintenance catwalk on bespin, the emperors throne room, the bridge across the chasm at Star killer base (where Ben killed Han), the place where Luke trainer Rey, the place where Palpatine was underground in the rise of Skywalker, Jabbas palace, and so many others.\n\nA multiplayer mode to battle other people for the title of the most powerful Jedi or Sith around.\n\nI would so buy this game, and I would pay up to $25 dollars for just the features I listed.\n\nHowever, this game is perfect just the way it is, and it is a must buy! I hope this review helped.\n\nP.S\nI am sorry if I spelled anything wrong, these alien names are hard to spell for someone who speaks basic.\n\nHelpful | 344", "thejoecraft16 days ago\nSuper Awesome, life changing, but..\n\nSo I love Star Wars. Always have, always will, and this game has accomplished Star Wars. BUT the saber fighting (not just reflecting bullets, needs to happen MORE and Better.

Now this game is one of my favourites. The lightsaber mechanics are great, the story is good, and the fact that you can use blasters in this episode makes it the best out of the three. The story of this episodes took me about and hour, but youll lose track of time playing the lightsaber dojo. With the few occasions that Ill lose tracking for a moment due to moving to much in lightsaber dojo, Ive had no problems with the game. Id rate it 9/10 and the Vader immortal games are a must have to anyone with a quest, or oculus VR headset for that matter.\n\nHelpful | 0", "bailey20118 days ago\nAbsolutely worth it\n\nEven if you havent played the first and second and just want to give one a try, definitely give this a shot.

Ive never really got into the dojo in previous episodes, but in this one I cant stop playing. The force pull is kinda slow (would be incredibly OP if it wasnt) and the lightning takes til you defeat 50 enemies to charge up. All in all, if you like Star Wars, the game is a must have.

I can't believe how little game play exists in this 'game.' There is some good story that you mindlessly click through. A few very easy stormtroopers to beat. A very easy Tie-fighter to beat and you kinda fight Vader. When I saw Vader approach for a duel I was thrilled. I figured the time spent in the dojo would pay off as I fought the best. I was wrong. He is easier to fight off than the droids in the dojo. And all you do it place a lightsaber in a light and it all goes away. And the experience is over and you know there will be more episodes to pay for.\nThis company has a great license and is taking advantage of users by charging what feels like less for a game than the others on the market, but none of it feels like a full experience.\nAll three of these chapters might make a full game for $14.99 - But $30 for all three of these extremely short experiences is taking advantage of customers. The dojo kinda made up for this is episode two, but by episode 3 it's all very repetitive. Their way of charging you three times for exact same dojo.\nIf all three of these were considered one game for 15 dollars I would be at 5 stars and happy with the experience.

With 10 minutes of non-interactive cutscenes and perhaps 5 minutes of actual gameplay in the Story mode, it had much less content than I expected, even accounting for the episodic nature. This is redeemed by the lightsaber dojo, which is fun - but still feels like a very forced and limited experience. If you want to feel like a Jedi, this game will not deliver. With a horrifically awkward menu system and absurdly long loading times rounding it out, I can't rate this highly. I'd only get this if you are a diehard Star Wars fan.

And I feel there should be an advantage to each color that corresponds with the meaning. Like blue- can go through other sabers. Green- easier to use force. Red-lightning comes quicker . ECT.

Great job!\n\nEach new game you guys kept blowing my expectations so, if you wanted them to be completely vaporized I got a couple requests.\n\nMy suggestion. I really hope the devs read this. I love everything the dojo has but I want MORE. Personally I dont like timed challenges so maybe just a survival mode (as an alternative to unlock new sabers maybe). But the thing I really want is 1 v 1 battles. That fight with Vader was so fun. But I want more of em. Please guys!

I would have enjoyed a Star Wars VR game that is full of action and adventure. Sadly, when in reality this is more of a point and click game. Yes, the story is semi interesting, but lets be real, Dont you want to play a Star Wars VR game that makes you feel like you are welding a lightsaber at your own command in the Star Wars universe.\n\nI would have enjoyed light saber duels and killing storm troopers at will, but the game just sits you in front of action and you just stand in place mostly using the force to kill instead of your light saber. I really wanted to chop storm troopers in half with a light saber.\n\nAfter you complete the short story, in-which the ending was super lame because **spoiler alert*, you survive a light saber duel against the all powerful Vader. Theres no real fun or excitement for returning and playing the story again so the lack of replay value is low. We get a training DO-JO but again you really cannot have fun with hacking and slashing your lightsaber through multiple enemies, so ask yourself whats the fun in a Star Wars game if the missions are not epic, the fights are lame, and you weld a lightsaber, but theres no real fun of hacking and slashing multiple enemies.\nI would agree the sound is amazing, the musical score is great, and the story is interesting up until how the end plays out.

There is this one attack pattern that they use and I am able to block the first part of the attack (spin attack, straight right in my POV) and the second part of the attack passes through my lightsaber.

Also, much of what I say here applies to all three games.\n\n1) The software that handles the light saber needs work. I dont know if the developers of this series wrote their own or licensed code from someone else, but your motions with the saber, and even using the force with a hand, do not have consistent results. Vader Immortal is only fair compared to Beat Saber or Ninja Assassins in this regard.\n\n2) The plot needs some branch points built in. As it is, there is only one path forward, and things literally come to a halt while it waits for you to do whatever you have to do correctly. I recall reading a comment by someone else who said this limitation was imposed by the Star Wars copyright holders who sold this more advanced capability to other game developers. I dont know. Its just frustrating because it limits what is otherwise a great game.\n\n3) Despite the previously described issues I gave this 5 stars because its still a lot of fun. Im admittedly a Star Wars geek (nearly 70 years old, and need to grow up!) and really enjoy the environment. The basic artwork is great, and the basic plot is fun. Ive long been a sci-fi book reader, but participatory sci-fi is a kick. Being able to actually move is SO much better than the thumb workout you get on an Xbox or Play Station.\n\nConclusion: I would recommend this to other Star Wars fans. Heavy duty gamers may find it too elementary.\n\nNOTE TO THE DEVELOPERS: I would be willing to pay for an upgrade to all three parts of Vader if you addressed issues 1 and 2.\n\nHelpful | 31", "brettyboiJul 14 at 4:29 PM\nAmazing.... for Star Wars fans\n\nI love this app but I will say If youve never seen Star Wars the storyline might be hard to understand for you but ill give this game a 4 star\n\nHelpful | 0", "the1obiwanMay 18 at 1:22 PM\nStory gets 4 stars but Dojo gets 5 stars\n\nThe story is alright and I liked the conclusion but I thought the fight against Vader would not only be longer but be more intense.

It has SO many different light saber colors and hilts. You can use your favorite lightsaber hilts from\nQui-gons to Ahsokasto even derth vaderss. You can fight against stormtroopers, robots and more. Not only do you just have lightsabers but you also have the force. You can force choke your enemy. You also can steal stormtroopers blasters and use them against them. You also have grenades which can be extremely helpful against high damage enemies. But this mode has so many different levels and so many different fighting arenas.

The only thing I could wish differently is almost like a sandbox mode where you can throw your lightsaber around and takedown enemies without the timer and different levels. Also for all the 1 star rating for audio but no visuals in the beginning...that's part of the game. It's an intro to the 3rd chapter of what happened in 1 & 2.

Can't wait to buy the other ones.\n\nHelpful | 1", "DeSmikkelMar 31 at 7:44 AM\nAn accurate simulation of a lightsaber\n\nI have got addicted to this game.\nI started played VR with the pure intent of feeling like a jedi and this game was amazing at doing just that. The story mode is cool, and it fits into the story of Star Wars, so it being cannon is epic as well, but the best thing about this game in my opinion, is the training area. You can unlock all sorts of lightsabers, including my favorite one: the Double-Bladed lightsaber from Darth Maul. I have been kind of no-living it even though Ive completed all the trainings 3 times already. I can safely say I have become quite a jedi/sith master.\n\nStill, this games has some serious changes that have to be made to make this feel actually cool. Such as the fact that stabbing isnt a thing in this game, though it could easily be a thing, considering the fact that if you throw your lightsaber into a robot it sticks into the robot for a second, before retracting back. This could be featured by making the lightsaber kind of stuck, or hardly movable in the body of the robot. There is also a part in the story mode that makes you cut through a big pillar. You could slash through it but that wouldnt cut it so you had to do it slowly where it was slowly movable. This principle could be applied to the robots in the dojo as well where it would be stunned if you would stab it or cut through it slowly, where it would die after you retract your lightsaber. the fact that the strongest robot can only be killed after 5 or 6 direct hits is not that good as well. There should honestly be a hardcore mode where you die the moment youre hit, but robots do too.\nIt would also be cool if you would be abled to walk and jump around in the dojo (even though jumping might not be the best idea due to easy motion sickness). Now youre just standing and waiting for the enemy to attack, so you can counter-attack.\nLastly, I think there should be bosses, or only one boss like Darth Vader who attacks way faster and way cooler to actually fight in a duel now.\n\nThese are all suggestions which I think should be added to make the dojo a bit cooler. Furthermore I believe that this game has a lot of potential so even if this game-trilogy isnt going to be updated, it deserves a new game hopefully with these features.\nI know this was rather a list of improvements than an actual recommendation, but if youre doubting to buy the game and got as far into this text as you have, then I really recommend this game, even if you havent played the first two. Its definitely the best Vader Immortal game with all the force powers and lightsabers.\n\nHelpful | 4", "Balakae.exeFeb 20 at 4:00 PM\nYum Yum!\n\nThis game is the best out of the trilogy. The first two are good but this one stands out. Having the longest experience and the most to do in the dojo. If youre looking to buy just one of these games, buy this one. The others have shorter experience and the dojos are no where near as fun as this. Get this game to have a blast.\n\nRecommendation for developers:\n1. Make a multiplayer mode, it would be awesome and so many more people would get this game\n2. Fix the 2D stormtrooper laser bullets, its annoying and should be 3D\n3. A sandbox mode would be awesome as well, it could introduce a whole new meaning into the game\n\nI hope this gets to the developers and it gets noticed.

Only other problem I had was that occasionally the lightsaber doesnt perfectly respond to your movements, however the lightsaber still feels absolutely fantastic to wield, deflecting blaster bolts, blocking the slashes from the bots, everything feels great, including the blaster, unfortunately the limited ammo just doesnt feel right, and sometimes as weird as it may sound Id like to just dual wield some blasters and go Rambo on some stormtroopers, lastly as far as gameplay goes, the force, the force grip feels really nice and satisfying, though occasionally a little OP, and the force lightning when you get to lightsaber dojo makes you feel so powerful and cool, though it doesnt last forever, I think its fair. Finally, as others have talked about, the lightsaber dojo part of this game is absolutely fantastic, a little repetitive but overall great, I, like many others would pay $10-$20 for a full game of a dojo with possible lightsaber customization, I like the glove customization, different blasters (with non finite ammo) and more force powers.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Hazey113May 11 at 12:56 PM\nAmazing 5 stars\n\nIt need something else like a mode where you can free roam the planet or something also if you could customize lightsabers that would awsome to\n\nHelpful | 0", "Limey_the_limeJun 7 at 7:20 AM\nFun game\n\nFilled with story also does not last long by itself but once you finish the lightsaber dojo is fun, especially when you have duel sabers\n\nHelpful | 1", "jahjahbinksMay 5 at 2:55 PM\nLove the game\n\nThis game was amazing!

Playing with the force is super fun and extremely responsive, and cutting clean through enemies is super satisfying (even though sometimes when you clearly block something you get hit anyways. Might want to work on that). The lightsaber dojo adds a lot of replay value and a good collection aspect for completing all the levels with a 3/3 rating, and being able to use all the rewards you get in the dojo is fun. I think its a little weird that you cant use them in the story but it kind of makes sense with that special lightsaber you get in episode 2. There is one problem though, besides the lightsaber dojo its really hard to pick up the game again. I think this comes from having little to no impact on the story, and especially since its a vr game it really impacts the immersion. It might be hard to do with each episode being a different app but I think having multiple endings would serve the game well. Maybe the devs could make it easier on themselves and turn the three separate apps into one app and have episode one be the original purchase with episodes two and three being dlc, which would be free for those who already had it. They could have a chart in the main menu for all the choices you have made so far as well! They could start with the player refusing to help Vader in episode 1, which would lead to some sort of death sentence ending. It would definitely encourage more people to buy it as well and I would always come back to it to revisit my favorite endings. I havent checked but it might already be in development, not sure though. They could do what duck season did and have the ending connecting to their other game be called the canon ending which would be the ending we currently have.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Droopedpigeon43Apr 30 at 11:38 AM\nWow wow wow\n\nLightsaber dojo is amazing I wont spill the beans but if you are thinking of getting this DO! \n\nHelpful | 0", "KMan1258Jun 28 at 1:59 PM\nA little more\n\nThis series for the quest is a one of a kid thing.

If you are, then just buy this, it's only $10 and you'll have a fun time.\n\nIf you're not, though... the story is weak, and lightsaber fighting doesn't feel natural (they've had the ability to dismember enemies based on where you cut them for years now, 2003's Jedi Academy had this as I recall. I'm not asking for spurting blood in a T-rated game, I'm just asking that my saber fights feel somewhat real, and my enemies taking 5 hits and then exploding doesn't qualify as such.) The voice acting for the droid is unconscionably irritating, and it runs pretty darn badly on Quest. Have yet to try the Link version of the game, but given that I have a fairly beefy computer I'll probably be more satisfied with that. ASW does a pretty good job of covering up a mediocre framerate, but... still, it's noticeable.\n\nOn a positive note, the game looks pretty good and the force gameplay is very fun. Additionally, the comfort settings they've added are pretty solid, and this game rarely makes me queasy (and when it does, it's due to a poor framerate and not to any of the developers' design choices.)\n\nSo, I'll reserve my ire for things that actually suck on Quest, like Guns N Stories. This is a pretty okay game, and picking up an episode wouldn't do you any harm. Just make sure you buy this one (ep. 3) as lightsaber dojo, the most replayable part of the entire game, is fully fleshed out in this episode, with force choking, lightsaber throwing, blaster-shooting and thermal detonators.

The story was fun, but it was relatively short at around 30 minutes, and they probably could have made it longer by making it a lot harder.(just adjust it so you die in like 3 shots and have a bunch of different difficulties which give a reward to the dojo, it would make it more replayable). That being said, the story was super immersive and felt awesome to be inside of.\n\nI bought this solely for the dojo, and for $10 its absolutely worth it. There are lots of droids and troopers to fight in the dojo, and it requires lots of fun baddonky movement (especially when fighting the droids with their own lightsabers, blocking, parrying, then striking is so satisfying). You can customize lightsabers and gloves, dual wield, and even use darth mauls double bladed lightsaber. There are 47 levels, many of them are hard. Even after beating all of them, you still dont get all the unlockables until you go back and beat the best times with high health to get all 3 stars. I also found it fun figuring out what strategies to use to kill them quickly, or trying to challenge myself to fight using only ashokas backwards short lightsaber.\n\nIn addition to how fun it is, playing this hame gives you quite a workout when dodging and striking, and especially when using the force to fling droids around.

The only thing is they need to remove to the barrier since there is guardian mode, and move the boundaries to the edge of the map preventing us from falling and dying. I also wish they would add features from light saber dojo such as lightsaber throw, force lightning, and more blaster opportunities.\n\nThe light dojo is very interactive and personally better than the story **combat wise**. Although challenging this gives rewards for hard work as it gives gloves colors and variations, lightsabers, and tips how to play and combat moves.\n\nVery good game overall, adding a star fighter game would make the Star Wars game series on VR better, adding a more variety to gameplay!\n\nHelpful | 1", "Tone9605Jan 20 at 2:34 PM\nPerfection.\n\nLiteral perfection.

In the actual game i think if you were actually able to fail/die and get reset to like a recent check point I think that would be better because being struck down 12 times is a little less realistic than 3 or 4. However the lightsaber dojo NEEDS to be easier. Having to kill 250 enemies in 7 minutes with at least 15 enemies at you all at once dealing 3-4 out of 5 hearts every time they hit you is really hard to defend off.\n\nI am also 11 years old to point that out not trying to be picky just trying to help you guys out :)\n\nHelpful | 0", "Loganlocke34Jan 19 at 10:19 AM\nAmazing\n\nThis game really made me feel immersed in the Star Wars universe and I have to say I loved it.

Realistically, though, it added nothing, and detracted from the experience just a little bit.\n\nThe dojo is loads of fun, and is my favorite part of the entire game. The dojo by itself is worth the $10 I paid for the game. There are several levels where I dispense with the light sabers entirely, and just use the Force.\n\nAs with episode 2, you have Force and light saber abilities. You can get blasters and thermal detonators, but I found the former to be of little utility compared to the Force, and the latter to be available only briefly (though they were useful at times).\n\nI intend to play again when I have more time.

Now dont get me wrong, the story is good but the first chapter really wowed me, the second was quite forgettable hence the reason I think this sits comfortably in second place story wise. There is some truly epic moments to be had, such as controlling an entire army (for a minute), fighting on speeder craft whilst defending yourself from waves of stormtroopers.

The dojo is my absolute favorite part not just because of how many levels the satisfying(most of the time) combat physics, but the fact that you have an incredible variety of saber colors, types, and original hilts. I say most of the time because there are points in the dojo where a droid/sentinel attack will go straight through my saber and hit me, which I find a bit annoying. The only thing I would ask to be added is a tougher dojo difficulty. Once you learn the patterns of all the enemies, they tend to become extraordinarily predictable.

The stopstart, actiontocutscene structure is still annoying, but you can enjoy it nonetheless.\nThe biggest plus for me is the dojo. You have a lot more options for how to play this time. And, I *really* like the throwing mechanic. I don't know why, but very few VR games seem to get throwing right. This is the best I've tried. You can absolutely hurl your lightsaber, or any other object, and it flies from your hand exactly as you want it to. Blasters and grenades can also be used. Dual wield lightsabers too. And of course, the force, though it's still quite clunky IMO. I spent a lot of time between rounds just playing with the weapons on offer, with no enemies around, because the interaction mechanics are so satisfying and the environment is just a pretty cool world to spend time in. Are there other arenas to unlock? That would be the icing on the cake.\n\nPs. Like the second one, the story mode is short. For me, it was a onesitting play-through.

Yes, you deserve to be aware youve been hit, but such a big, red filter over your line of sight is not it.\n\nEarly on, Id like the option to battle a single combatant at a time to get good at maneuvers.

All that and the fact I can use a lightsaber was amazing.

I am happy with the length of the experience as most would compare it to a movie, but not with the content provided in the time I played. It was lame. Everything seems as though it's holding your hand too much to the point that it's a bore and it made me question \"am I a baby or an adult\". You can't mess up or die, if you try to do so it isn't possible. And from the gaming aspect it offers very little difference to the outcome when I try to apply skill. It feels lackluster and besides hype monkeys for the series or braindead players I think you should be bored for the cost. Plus the game has this weird BEEP when it's heavy on level loading.

I love that they had most of the story act as a raid on Vaders base, and being able to see an entire battle act out is very entertaining. The only complaint that I really have about the story is the 1 on 1 fight against Vader himself. While I understand that they wanted you to have a fair battle with him, but going from him ripping apart a base with nothing but the force and throwing it at you in fallen order to a basic fight in this game is jarring. The dojo is much harder than the previous games due to the addition of weapons like grenades, and blasters, and by adding storm troopers to the fight. They make it impossible to get all three points in a level without using those, which makes it incredibly hard to unlock the lightsabers/gloves. They have an amazing collection of lightsabers that you can use. They added new types as well as new models which gives you more variety as to how you can play.

If each episode had been relatively over an hour, this could've been much better. We never get to just sit back and view the scenery and world building. Yes, the little blaster part was cool, but the way it ran out of ammo killed the mood for me.

Yes, it does get more difficult as you go up in levels, but there's nothing else besides changing the color of your saber.\nThis trilogy of Star Wars VR feels like a waste of time in the end. The video ads for the Quest make this series look hectic, and so exciting, but that feeling is only found in the second episode when you actually obtain the force, and get trained by Vader himself.

Blocking lasers: when someone shoots at you in the game you cant just do some cool stuff swinging your lightsaber hitting each laser no you have to hold it straight otherwise the game wont pick up you hitting it and it will hit you.

There is only one real saber fight and it's short and has a forced ending. They need to add a lot more to this especially since it's a top advertised for the quest the most. All in all if your just in it for the force and light sabers you won't be disappointed, but you will get bored at some point do to very repative game play. You will probably enjoy the temple training mode more then anything but you will probably never play the story more then once do to how lack luster the first 2ep are and how forced the 3rd one puts Vader into the story.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Quest787Dec 6 at 5:47 AM\nBest of the trilogy\n\nMore jaw dropping moments than first two.

The game itself is the last in the Vader Immortal series and is easily the best one. The climatic ending of the game is quite satisfying for both Star Wars veterans and newbies alike. The cinematic play style is a great way for new VR users to become used to the controls and their new immersion.\n\nThe best part is easily the lightsaber dojo. With the use of the Force, the dojo becomes an enthralling immersive practice ground for the Padawan within you.\n\nThe only gripes I had with the game is there would be a hiccup or two as you progressed (lightsaber would glitch out a little, loose track of your hand, I dropped out of the map at one point), but nothing severe. Also, the lightsaber battles in the story mode seem a little lackluster vs its dojo counterpart.\n\nOtherwise, the game is a clear MUST BUY for the Oculus!

I would recommended people starting at the first episode despite the drop in episode 2 ( I was for returning it, but hey Star Wars) There are two aspects the training sessions and the film/game hybrid experience.\n\nThe training is fun!! Okay I cheated in the light sabre duals and used a blaster! Okay my light sabre skills have declined but I can practice that later. Use of the force seems easier, and more powerful than episode 2.\n\nThe film-game experience is the special part of this trilogy but can be too short (more of an issue in episode 2). You feel in the middle\nof a Star Wars film with the real characters. Keeping you to the plot can be too controlling and hence makes the experience short\nbut the extra action in this episode overcomes this. I prefer to be managed, have choice and\nexplore a bit. Do not expect puzzles, a little bit more of a challenge would be great.\n\nDrawbacks were long periods in the dark as footage loads (I assume)and a second clunky guardian system which is far poorer and leaves you disoriented.

The teams involved paid a lot of attention to detail and world building.\n\nPros: world details, story driven characters, seemless transitions, excellent action mechanics, great voice overs and script writing, you can get mesmerized at the depth of the locations, and more.\n\nCons: hard to come up with any honestly, I have to be nit picky to find any.. like during the character dialog scenes when you can still see your VR hands and punch out or move and nothing reacts or interacts with you. The opening dialog with a black screen could have been the tried and true scrolling text as with every Star Wars opening.\n\nSuggestion: it would be nice to be able to explore the world after youve played through the story and finder Easter eggs or something.\n\nI really hope this team makes a space action X Wing or some type of Star Wars ship based flight game with this much detail.\n\nHelpful | 0", "A_Frosty_EffectJan 22 at 7:53 AM\nGreat game!\n\nThe force mechanic is great.

Sometimes I would only take one step back and I immediately cant see for my view is obstructed by this notification. When you start to talk about the Lightsaber Dojo I dont quite know what to say, overall the experience is great and I wouldnt expect any less but of ways to make it better you could use a setting, like a toggle switch to allow multiple enemies to attack you at once.

The combat feels clunky, with the force just flat out not activating half of the time, and lightsabers sometimes will just pass through your own lightsaber for no reason. Same thing with enemies. All in all, its a visually great game were you relax and walk around, but fails to deliver in other aspects. If you are a fan of the cheesy, clunky original trilogy this is definitely the game for you.

However, this is more of an interactive story than a game. In the first chapter I was fully immersed thinking my actions mattered. I did not dare move as I stood face to face with Vader. But in episode 3 I felt like I was just being taken on a ride. When action was needed I would just wave my light saber around randomly and all the enemies would drop dead. So in the last fight with Vader, I did nothing. Vader kept hitting me again and again but I took no damage. I DID NOT DIE. But the story progressed anyway and I was able to defeat Vader and finish the game just standing there. So in my opinion, this game should be called Player immortal as you are basically just watching a story. There is no challenge and it doesnt really matter what you do - you will still advance.\n\nToo bad. It could have been a great game.\n\nI would love to see more games like these but with more action and increasingly challenging puzzles and fights.

The story although shot ties up the story nicely although I felt like I didnt do as much as the other games. The inclusion of blasters and thermal detonators are amazing and the feel so.\n\nI only hope the game creates a sequel, continuing the story in be form rather that comic book\n\nOther and that, amazing series and a very must buy\n\nWARNING the other games dojo will teach the the ropes but the game 3 dojo is the one thats worth while as you have all the sabres as the other games along with new and helpful abilities leaving the other dojos and pointless, not a problem, just the game evolving\n\nHelpful | 1", "wagnerstechtalkNov 22 at 10:10 PM\nFun Experience and the DoJo is COOL!\n\nI really enjoyed this series from ILM/Oculus, it was great fun! The story was very well-done and the experience was wonderful. I'm a big Star Wars fan, so those who are less of a fan may not appreciate it as much. I had some issues with the game mechanics, which you can see on my YT channel Wagner's Tech Talk (video here: https://youtu.be/fGgsc9HbKSg ). But, it was mostly just the length of time since playing the last episode allowed me to forget about some of the motions. As the game progressed, I picked back up a little.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy Star Wars, then I'd pick up this game but you might want to start with Episode I first. It's longer and you'll want to know the whole story. Then get II and III. They have a bundle available, but it doesn't save much. If you don't have Episode I already, just start there to see if you want to play the rest of the game.\n\nI hope that there are more Star Wars games coming! If they made this a 1-2 hour experience with space/ground combat, man that would be amazing!

The actual story mode was boring because all of the characters talk for way to long and you just want to get on with it. Also in the final scene of the game and your supposed to force pull your lightsaber over and the game kept glitching and wouldnt let me pick up my lightsaber. I had to reset the entirety of episode 3 just to be able to finish the game without it glitching out. Hated the story mode. Boring, annoying and a headache inducing experience in general.\n\nMy favourite part of the three episodes is the lightsaber dojo. There you can do a ton of really cool things like sith lightning and throwing your lightsaber which you cant even do in the actual story mode. There are a ton of different levels that you can play where you have to fight specific enemies in whatever way you can and its really fun. Not only that but you can unlock different gloves and lightsabers such as green, blue, red, purple, and yellow lightsaber colours and dual wielding lightsabers as well.\n\nI wouldnt say these games are worth buying as the lightsaber dojo does get kind of repetitive after a while and the story is horrendous to try and play through.\n\nHelpful | 0", "hotdogScrumNov 21 at 11:12 PM\nFinally the balance is restored!\n\nEpisode 1 was amazing.

You sit still 50% of all 3 episodes listening to frankly boring dialoge. If this wasnt in vr everyone would hate it. First the 2nd ep promised focus on force powers not force power, only one between all 3 episodes and it doesnt even function as well as it could. All combat is super easy there is one semi good fight against a tie fighter in all 3 episodes. All other fights are at best 3 troopers attack then 3 more then 3 more. Your options to attack are to flick your wrist for a force power. Deflect lasers with a lightsaber or a gun that fires like 10 shots and is wasted. The walking speed is the slowest of any vr game and most the time your stuck following an npc thats slower then that. So its half boring dialoge from boring chacters no time to flesh them out or give them storys just 95% exposition and the rest a few lame jokes. Then 40% following people walking at speeds i can top in crutches. Then 10% boring predictable combat. 30 dollars for like an hour and a half of this is unbelievable. The best part of each episode is the lightsaber dojo whos premise wears thin by ep 3. The only reason i can fathom this is getting goid reviews is people just being OMG depth perception this is the coolest thing ive seen in my life. But when viewed without child like fascination its just a boring story with very few chacters all one dimensional and the ability to wield a lightsaber. And again the lightsaber really only comes into play in the dojo. Each episode has not been worth 10 dollars and 30 dollars for a crappy experience packed with dojo that are all very similar.

This review is for those thinking of doing the same.\n\nLet's start with the positives. This game looks fantastic and delivers an exciting Star Wars experience. The characters, set pieces, and action sequences are genuinely interesting and well done. Also, wielding a lightsaber and using the force feels great. I was engaged from beginning to end.\n\nNow, the negatives. It's short. Really short. If you don't plan on bringing your Quest to parties for other people to try this game, it might not be much for your buck. But, if you're a party goer or plan to spend time fighting waves of enemies in the lightsaber dojo (there are unlockables to be gained), this is worth it. One thing this game does that I don't like is lock you in place for cutscenes where it'd be nice for you to walk around. But that's just a nitpick. One more thing: since it's episode 3, there's no tutorial. But if you've usee vr, you'll quickly find the controls are 95% intuitive.\n\nIn the end, if you care about lightsaber fighting more than the story, you can skip to this one.

The characters were great and your friends were comforting, apart from Vader of course, he is always terrifying!\nI am not going to lie, I was a bit upset because at the end when I was back on the ship I was really looking forward to going to get that treasure and it would be cool if you could maybe make AT LEAST one spin off where we go onto a planet that is not Mustafar as there are so many places I would like to visit other places that I have seen at the cinema and see other key characters instead of just Vader.\nI completely understand that this series is VADER Immortal but a spin off would be cool!\nAll in all I loved this game and will be attempting, although I will be afraid, the lightsaber dojo levels.

I loved the three episodes, it feels so immersive. That's what I told Mark, the producer, when I saw him in Paris for NewImages. However I do have one gripe as a left-handed person : the very end of the game really hurt me. Up to there, immersion is complete and amazing but for this one simple thing you couldn't make sure to check for left handed people and right handed people? By just adjusting our position? I'm really saddened by this. Anyways. Thank you for all this.\n\nHelpful | 1", "jace.garfieldDec 1 at 7:27 AM\nStyle/Substance\n\n The creators of this game definitely chose style over substance. It was thrilling in episode one to come face-to-face with Darth Vader , storm troopers and to use the light saber for the first time. In episode two you got to use the force for the first time and episode three you got to use the force and the light saber combined for the first time but most of the thrill of the game was to be found in episode one and two. If youre purchasing this game for the experience of being in a Star Wars world than it is worth every penny. If you are purchasing this product as a game it is oversimplified. The light saber battles leave much to be desired. If this game is for young children it is perfect because theres no way to lose your pulled through the story, at many times too fast. In most traditional gameplay youre allowed to explore the environments youre in. Well the environments are very cool if you take more than a couple steps either direction youre outside of the game and so effectively cant explore.\n\nSuggestions for future development.\n1. Bring episodes together And put them in the menu to be selected.\n2. Add levels of difficulty so that what gameplay experience there is within the story can be made more challenging. Its not always fun to automatically win there is excitement in building a level youve previously had difficulty passing...You robbed the players of half the reward of playing a game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "PRCheekaJan 1 at 7:05 PM\n\nGreat graphics!\n\nHelpful | 0", "CenturionC4Dec 8 at 6:22 AM\nGreat game!\n\nI played all three episodes and this one by far is the best one.

Its not good. I love Star Wars and I was so excited by the idea of this game. I thought the first two episodes were cool but the third episode was absolutely terrible. The characters are either insanely irritating or so bland and boring that it makes you want to fall asleep in your headset. This series had so much potential but the developers were just looking to draw people in with Star Wars attached to the front of this game. The supposed final battle with Vader is the stupidest thing in this game. When you are fighting with a Sith Lord, youd expect it to be exciting. But instead, when Vader is about to end us, we get saved by a faceless ghost who I cant be bothered to care about. The lightsaber dojo should really be customizable and this story moves so slow Im surprised it didnt take longer then a half hour to finish the third episode. We are randomly taken out of exciting scenes to be forcefed massive chunks of exposition about Vader wanting to destroy the Mustafar. I cannot stress enough how irritating that robot sidekick is. Its like its only there so we can be forced to hear one liners against our will and (especially in the third episode) hear the term bucket heads over and over and over again. Also, they cant even say lightsaber? Do they have to say laser sword? Overall, this is very disappointing because I know that these developers can do so much better. If they released a new, better game that was engaging, spaced out the exposition, and had fun characters, and could even use oculus new hand tracking, I think I would give this game a shot.

However, in the dojo training, I wish there were different levels of difficulty. Im probably bad at the game, but I cant get past level 20. I probably wont play the game again unless there is a easier difficulty mode, because I have already beat the main story and Im just playing the dojo mode now. And, in the dojo mode you dont heal. This makes the mode a lot more hard, and you can only take a limited amount of hits in each level. If you actually regenerated health normally, then the mode would be a lot easier. But, if people want a harder difficulty and didnt want to regenerate health, then they could choose that as one of the options.

Even more than the first two episodes, this episode just doesn't give you any sort of freedom. Your being guided in every step you make and what you can do. What did we learn saber throw for if we can't use it in story mode? Most of these things have been said by others, so I'll stop here.\n\nThe \"game\" is definitely worth the 10 bugs and a nice ending to a great cinematic VR series. I just hope lessons we're learned and we will get a fully blown Star Wars VR game in the future!\n\nHelpful | 0", "captainchazNov 23 at 11:32 AM\nStrong, Classic Star Wars Conclusion\n\nEpisode 3 is a strong conclusion to the series. I love episode 1, and I enjoy episode 2 even though it seemed overpriced given its length. This final episode reminded me much more of the first, and being able to use blasters and thermal detonators on top of the saber and the force exceeded my expectations. The assault on Vader's castle was surprisingly thrilling, and it was a treat to clash sabers with Vader. Although the experience is not yet perfectly polished: There are a couple of minor bugs and a few awkward cuts. That said, I would strongly recommend this experience -- especially for any fan of the original trilogy or Rogue One. (That may also be partly why I enjoy episodes 1 and 3 more than 2: the settings have more of a classic Star Wars feel.)\n\nFWIW: I'd say this episode's length falls between episode 1 and 2, depending on one's style of play. While I have been able to complete it in half-an-hour, I have also played it for about 45 minutes without its seeming drawn out.\n\nHelpful | 1", "How_is_your_dayNov 23 at 4:32 PM\nDid we forget to add something?\n\nFun? Yes, this was my favorite episode! A great game for starwars fans? One hundred precent fun! This game was short, but It was the most fun I have had in months! Some features (spoiler alert) like controling the robot army only happened once which was dissapointing. But using the force felt very nice and having a blaster and explosives, just wow. If you got the other 2 then this one is NEEDED!\n\nHelpful | 0", "TheGodOfWar1933Nov 23 at 12:37 PM\nVery good\n\nI want to first start off this review by saying that Vader Immortal III is a very good game. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to pick up blasters and thermal detonators and I liked there was almost like two boss battles one, Vader (obviously) and to one you dont really know about before youre actually in the fight. (No spoilers here) However I wish you wouldve had more time controlling the sentinels it is fun among there blaster fire in the beginning but it was very short-lived I thought it would be cool to have a scene like a storm trooper was standing over you and you call over at Sentinel and it stabs the guy in the back or something. I also think their awards in Vaders dojo are a lot better plus being able to grab a blaster and shoot in that mode is also fun. I havent played a lot of the dojo but I think it would be cool if they added in like a boss fight or something like something out of Mario. Maybe you could fight another Sith or something. I also think the ending of the fight with Vader was a tiny bit anti-climactic thats why my review is four stars out of five. Lastly I would like to know if this game is canon to the story of star wars. If it is my guess is that it is probably in between the Prequels and the originals ( between episodes 3 and 4). All things being said though its a very good game and very worth $10\n\nHelpful | 0", "Quill-SanNov 21 at 5:29 PM\nGood but Short!\n\nEpisode III, just like the first 2 it was great in visual audio and gameplay. But I feel like it was seriously lacking in length. It seemed like it may have been half the length of the first 2. Was it worth the $10 I feel like it was but would have rather waited longer for a release and get more story. Hopefully if there's a next one itll be a longer story.\n\nHelpful | 1", "evandaganDec 22 at 12:42 PM\nGreat \"Experience\"\n\nFirst off, this is barely a game. There's little-to-no agency for the player, aside from a few combat scenes, but even these seem impossible to fail and tend to just end after a set amount of time. The Dojo mode may satisfy that itch for some people, but it's essentially an arcade style shooter and didn't hold my attention for long.\n\nBut if you're more interested in the storyline, neat environments, and best-of-system graphics, then it's definitely worth checking out. Like the other episodes, the main narrative in this episode takes about 30-45 minutes to work through, and is entertaining enough, but is barely worth the $9.99 price. I bought all three episodes as they were released, and never felt ripped off, but taken as a whole $30 is a lot for the amount of content here. A fun, immersive experience that feels more like a tech demo or an \"intro to VR\" than a proper game.\n\nHelpful | 0", "blocker_5417Nov 27 at 2:13 PM\nverry awsome game\n\nim so happy to this game ,i really feel everything i hope more game like thiss i will give 100%satisfied \n\nHelpful | 0", "JinxuanCDec 3 at 10:04 AM\nAll I want\n\nUse forceunlock a variety of lightsaberseven use the force lighteningIs this crazy I can do this all day\n\nHelpful | 0", "seanjoaoDec 3 at 8:20 AM\nIs it over?\n\nI looked forward to each instalment.

The gameplay was not as good as I expected. Lightsaber duels were few and far between and I didnt even get to cut down any storm troopers with my saber. When I started the game I expected something like The Force Unleashed, but to my disappointment it was nothing like that. You spend a lot of time standing still in predetermined zones that it guides you toward. The main thing you do is catch things with the force and throw them. Not very amusing. It was hard to be immersed because I couldnt help but feel that the game was made in a hurry and half-assed. If Star Wars ever gets another VR game (which hopefully it will) I would rather have something like Fallen Order or Force Unleashed as I mentioned earlier. There was no character development. No choosing of your own abilities and upgrading them. No meat and potatoes. Basically, the game is bare bones and not worth the price tag. One thing I did like, however, is the fact that you can pick up guns from fallen stormtroopers. Overall, the game left my hunger for VR Star Wars unsatiated, hence my 2 star rating. Honestly, im surprised Lucasfilms allowed such a game to be released. Well, they did release 2 battlefront games after all.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Spinto46Dec 22 at 10:37 AM\nGreat game\n\nGreat series\n\nHelpful | 0", "kris.maizeDec 4 at 3:25 PM\nloved it\n\nplayed this and loved it,I started it stopped went to work and couldn't wait to get home to play again\n\nHelpful | 0", "ClockworkgeckoDec 16 at 5:58 AM\nIt just works\n\nAbsolutely fantastic, true star wars vibes\n\nHelpful | 0", "Lil_TyrantJan 2 at 12:19 AM\nWhich there was a free roam\n\nIf only there was a sandbox or free roam thing in this game I would definitely vote 5 stars\n\nHelpful | 0", "trebek4ssbuDec 28 at 7:25 AM\nWell... its pretty good\n\nId give five stars if most of the previous 2 wasnt just watching stuff happen.

I will say that overall VI as a series is some of the best VR I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Fun atmosphere, epic music, solid controls and comfort options. It really makes you feel like you're stepping into a star wars movie. Pat three also somehow seems to push the graphics even further, the character textures just look cleaner than before. With all that said I feel like part three fails to deliver on the promise made by parts one and two. You enter on the cusp of an epic battle, which sounds awesome, however the plot and flow of that build up feel rushed here, there are fewer big set pieces and puzzle elements as you move from point to point. There is probably more combat than part 1 or 2 with several boss fights and skirmish encounters. But the bosses feel weak or like they're quickly dispatched without letting the moment of victory sink in. Would really love to see more adventures of the windfall crew but I hope next time around they improve the pacing a bit.\n\nHelpful | 7", "spartancaNov 21 at 7:23 PM\nYes!Yes!Yes!\n\nThis is a game that lets dreams come true.

Reviews I have seen are saying how it is an experience but why cant you pick to join the dark side and open up a completely different story. Adding the option of choice. If they have the player some options than it would add so much to the game and give it some more content because it is 9 USD for what is basically a 20- 25 monitor story.

Speaking solely on the third episodes campaign, it feels rushed. Its a very linear journey and surprisingly manages to find ways to make using a lightsaber in battle kinda boring. At times the third episodes campaign felt like a rail shooter where you walk forward a little bit, wait to be shot at, block the bullets, move forward, repeat. Its no secret that the past two episodes have been building to a fight with Vader, and sadly that fight doesnt live up to your hopes. However! The lightsaber dojo, this challenge mode where youre given free reign to dual wield lightsabers or force choke stormtroopers certainly makes this game something special. Its an experience, not necessarily a game. Going into it expecting a tear jerking story or a level of freedom and exploration would be expecting the wrong game. Getting to use a lightsaber or the force or a stormtroopers blaster are what this game does right, and for that I could recommend it.

You could have really delved into the players psyche, bringing in the lightning and throwing of the lightsaber as if we were going to the dark side.\n\nI also really missed the climbing aspects as they were so so cool and where were the puzzles? You could have introduced a handful, which would have slowed the game down a little. It seriously did feel like we were on a conveyor belt and agree with some other players comments that you felt pushed from\nBoss to boss, whos defeat seemed overlooked as we were pushed into the next bit. And the battle against Vader, who this game was based around really felt like the developers wanted to just get the game finished. You could have brought in so many different aspects, such as fighting off Vaders choke with the lightsaber throw, the ability to use the force on Vader, and an environment that was interactive.\n\nAgree with the other players that its be nice to have a single game now that pulls all three episodes together for those that have bought them all. Id like to see some future updates on the dojo, introducing different enemies, maybe even some allies appearing to help out.\n\nI also think after such a short episode, the next series where they venture using the map that some of us that have supported you get a discount.\n\nAnyhow, thats my pennys worth.
