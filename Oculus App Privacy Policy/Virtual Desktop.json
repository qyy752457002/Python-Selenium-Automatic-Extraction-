There are a few hoops to jump through, (sideloading, optimizing network connections, etc.), but the wireless freedom cannot be overstated. I even own a PCVR headset with a wireless kit which can technically present better visuals, but I use the Quest because it is so much more convenient.\n\nThe one-man dev team is constantly updating and tweaking, while providing superb customer support through Reddit and Discord. So go ahead and buy this already!\n\nHelpful | 128", "FleshyMonkey7 days ago\nBetter than Oculus Link\n\nIf you want to play games not native to the Quest, you should get this app. Not only does it free you from the annoying cable that tethers you to your computer and interferes with your movements, it also seems less glitchy than the Oculus Link thats still in bet for the Quest. You can use Virtual Desktop for any game you would normally plug in for, including Rift or Steam VR games, or you can just experience your everyday computer apps on a VR screen for no good reason I can think of.\n\nHelpful | 12", "RassixMay 16 at 2:12 AM\nWorks better than Link (when up)\n\nI got my Quest, and proceeded to get SteamVR running on the Link cable. Besides the annoyance of a cable, in The Labs I couldn't throw the stick to the robot dog properly. It just didn't go more than a meter, and it didn't feel right. My daughter pressed on me that throwing the stick to the dog was a crucial feature.\n\nBased on the reviews for Virtual Desktop, I thought \"what the heck\" and gave it a try. Best decision. I had it up and running in 10 minutes, and besides not having a cable around my ankles, it was buttery smooth, and throwing worked so much better. There is some small amount of lag when moving hands, but after a minute I didn't notice it anymore.\n\nI have been traversing the world in Google Earth, and playing Half-Life: Alyx, and it is a magical experience being untethered.\n\nThe only fly in the ointment is that I'm sitting here a week later, on a Sunday, and the Virtual Desktop Servers are down, and I'm unable to play. At the moment there is a hard requirement on being able to connect to the global Virtual Desktop Servers, even though you're playing on you own LAN. Hopefully this can be fixed in the future. Thus 4/5 stars.\n\nUpdate May 16th 2020:\nVersion 1.13.6 of Virtual Desktop now doesn't require an internet connection for startup, so my only complaint has been fixed. Very active developer who listens to feedback is fantastic. So 5/5 stars.\n\nHelpful | 793", "NorianJul 19 at 1:40 PM\nWireless PC VR app. Better than link.\n\nThis is the app you want. It allows for wireless VR to your PC. So now you can use the Quest as your PC VR without a USB link. Its pretty amazing. Note, you need a Ethernet connection to your PC and a wireless 5Ghz network for no lag. Wire free VR with access to all PC VR games. Its so good, Oculus devs should just acquire this team and make it a part of the Quest offering.\n\nHelpful | 16", "JoeMamaJul 6 at 7:25 AM\nStreaming PC VR - good, not perfect\n\nI tried and refunded this app many months ago and recently gave it another try. Bravo to the developer for improving the streaming feature. Wireless, high fidelity VR is now possible (with some caveats)!!!\n\nI have access to a gymnasium and can't wait to try half life alyx with no artificial locomotion. The gunfights are going to be insane.\n\nThanks again dev! You've accomplished something that few people thought was possible from existing wifi hardware.\n\nEdit 1\nUnfortunately streaming PC VR games isn't quite flawless. I get frequently jitters and stutters regardless of the settings. I've spent a ton of hours researching and testing every virtual desktop, router, steam VR and Nvidia setting without any resolution. I even tried on two different PC's with the same results. It appears that virtual desktop is causing frame drops even when the scene is simple. I don't experience jitter with ALVR but unfortunately it has other issues that make it not ready for prime time. I hope the developer of virtual desktop can fix the jitter problems because he's so close to a flawless product.\n\nEdit 2\nA friend tried to get virtual desktop running buttery smooth on his system but ran into the same issue. He has an RTX 2070 and has done everything possible to get it perfect but experiences the same jitter. Hopefully the developer will fix this bug. Hate to take a star but it has to be done until the jitter bug is fixed.\n\nEdit 3\nI chatted with a guy on discord who convinced me that at least part of the issue is wifi. I bought a different router, played with more settings and reduced the jitter. It's still there and annoying but I guess that's the nature of VR over wifi. Hopefully Oculus will release there own solution and hardware but until then virtual desktop is the best solution. Once again, good job developer and thank you for tackling this. I'm going back to five stars.\n\nHelpful | 32\nDeveloper ResponseJul 2 at 11:25 PM\n\nHi, there isnt a jitter bug. The quality of the video stream will depend largely on your network setup and GPU. Check the pinned messages in #vr-streaming-help on Discord for tips", "dontherecluse11 days ago\nEssential for Oculus Quest\n\nBuy it. Sideload it. Then enjoy wireless PC VR. This app puts your desktop right in front of you with intuitive controls for operating and adjusting for comfort.\n\nEverything is fast when it all works. Fast launch -> auto connect -> side menu -> games -> go. You need a 5ghz router, but not an expensive one. I can run insane bitrate on a $50 TP Link.\n\nWhat I really like is how easy it is to set up and all it takes is your Oculus username. Yes, it works over internet. And yes, it works on a cloud gaming PC like Shadow. I got to show my parents Google Earth VR with that setup, and they loved it.\n\nThis app expands Oculus Quest to be an all around solution to VR gaming. I can't wait to see what more it can do like the video library.\n\nHelpful | 3", "emilioadastraJul 22 at 5:41 PM\nAbsolutely amazing\n\nWorks great with SteamVR if you side quest/side load a patched version. Latency is generally very low, but is extremely dependent (understandably) on low latency high speed wireless. Ideally the only wireless connection should be between your quest and router, be sure you're gaming computer is wired. AMD latency has also been fixed.A+++ this really is one of the best apps in that it enables PCVR\n\nHelpful | 7", "liinaharja6 hours ago\nSimple and functioning\n\nMirroring everyone else; if you have a PC capable of VR games, buy this app. You get the best of all worlds. I'm playing ridiculously modded Fallout 4 VR wirelessly on my lawn, and enjoying it latency-free.\n\nFor the best experience I recommend having a 5Ghz router with the PC connected via ethernet, but I utilise my phones mobile hotspot very successfully and therefore can manage to game practically everywhere.\n\n5/5, a must-have app!\n\nHelpful | 0", "JSTP8313 days ago\nMust have to get full access into VR\n\nOf course you can use Oculus Link but it is not the same because you hang on a wire!\nSince I got VD I spend 90% of my time on Virtual Desktop in VR!\nBe sure your hardware specifications fulfill the requirements and then you can dive into the hole world of virtual reality!!!\nGo to YouTube to get help for the installation and the steps you have to do(side quest,etc). There are a lot of detailed videos about it!\n\nC ya in VR\n\nHelpful | 0", "superminimax33 days ago\nSo much better than Oculus Link\n\nI originally tried this on someone else's Quest to play some point-and-click games on PC before I found out about the SideQuest mod that allows you to use VD for VR games as well as PC games. At the time I was running Oculus Link and had constant issues with cable disconnects, crashes, and overall buggy behavior. Once I switched to VD and wired my PC with LAN to my router I haven't had a problem since playing my favorite PCVR games on the Quest. Highly recommended for anyone that has a good router and Ethernet to their computer!\n\nHelpful | 0", "dominic_awsomehead7 days ago\nYou could do pcvr games now\n\nAt first I was at a update that i could not connect to my computer and when I updated it I could play pcvr games and it is great I recommend this game and if you cant go into your computer on the vr you have to go to side quest and go into vr desktop and press update but you have to plug it in with your pc with a usb c\n\nHelpful | 1", "Golden_Mind7 days ago\nVirtually Awesome\n\nI used the 5ghz wifi with this. I used an ethernet cable with this. First difference is vd connects much quicker with laptop using ethernet cable. Second difference is it does feel more stable with cable. I then switched my router back to dual band and to my surprise, it worked overall well. I am very happy with my purchase.\n\nThe developer was very supportive too.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Roxtar738 days ago\nWorks great with Sidequest patch!\n\nIt works well once its been patched. You can stream PC VR games straight to your Quest with no wires needed. The Oculus software doesnt like my computer because its minimum specs for VR but using Virtual Desktop allows me to play to my hearts content. Thank you Oculus for allowing the patch to live on sidequest. Thank you Virtual Desktop for making a quality piece of software. Its a great product I highly recommend. 10/10.\n\nHelpful | 1", "nycwojo9 days ago\nAmazing really amazing\n\nSo my setup is a yoga 930 notebook with external 1080 Aorus box via thunderbolt and I have a amplifi router (5ghz).\n\nI can play half life alyx on low via 5 ghz only on Oculus and Notebook - it is much better to wire in the notebook for bandwidth but I was floored it worked and does not stuffer at all if all apps closed in laptop.\n\nBut this link was Easy to setup and even the controls for sizing and rotating windows is well done\n\nHelpful | 0", "JHstruttonJul 14 at 11:02 AM\nit works flawlessly\n\nAs i said in the title the virtual desktop app works purfectly.

But even if these never get added i will countiue to use this.\n\nHelpful | 4", "TheGreatGherkin8 days ago\nMost valuable app for the quest!\n\nThis is easily the app with the most bang for your buck on the Quest. Being able to wirelessly play PCVR titles is a game changer. Pair this app with Shadow PC and you dont even need to buy a gaming computer. It is amazing playing Skyrim VR and fallout VR! I cant wait to try Half Life Alyx!\n\nHelpful | 0", "MightyQuinnJ13 days ago\nWireless PCVR!!! Need I say more?!\n\nWhy are you still reading?! This is a must have even if you dont have a gaming pc! Its so great to be able to chill on your recliner or from anywhere and work on your computer! But if you do have a gaming pc this app turns your Quest into a SUPER QUEST!! Just be sure to join VDs Discord to get help on setting it up and to get the best settings! Everyone in their Discord is super helpful! Also they are contentiously adding updates and more features! Its so good!!\n\nBEST DEVELOPER ON THE QUEST\n\nHelpful | 1", "Kryphon14 days ago\nAmazing app, so simple to set up\n\nStreaming my steam games from my PC to the headset was a breeze with this app. Following the very detailed step by step instructions eliminated any guess work and got it working within minutes of starting.

Have recommended to friends with same results.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DangerTeenager13 days ago\nAmazing!\n\nI didnt want to pay for it at first, but Im soo glad I did. It is extremely helpful. The UI is very responsive and easy to use. I never thought Ill just lay around the house using my PC through VR. It is also the perfect replacement for the link since it has a lot of issues. The idea of changing environments is also great.\nDefinitely would recommend buying.\n\nHelpful | 0", "TiberiusX17 days ago\nGood Software so far.\n\nLast month I got my quest and the next day i buy virtual desktop and installed the patch.\nThen I start playing pcvr and I like to be free without any cable.

I had a VR capable laptop and was pleased with the decent PCVR experience i had in VD (via Sideloaded APK), as i could play a few slower titles without any issues then (latency around 50-60 ms).\nI unfortunately even purchased the official link cable to have full latency free experience.\nNow with the software rewrite and all the updates (current latency 25-40 ms), i write this review as a shoutout to the great work by the developer @GuyGodin, who has outclassed even the Oculus engineers with the PCVR experience that matches the Oculus link, and outclasses it by being totally Wireless.\n\nHelpful | 55", "JamalDolleyGames16 days ago\nMind blown!!!\n\nI primarily use my Quest to play PCVR via link.

You get all of this plus seamless access to your desktop in one easy to use app with none of the cable hassle.\n\nHelpful | 0", "lilhaterApr 9 at 3:27 AM\nSeamless smooth experience\n\nI have been using Virtual Desktop for awhile now and it's been getting better and better with every upgrade. I use the side loaded version so I can play SteamVR games on the Quest.\n\nI didn't realise how good this app really was until I tried Oculus Link using a third party cable. I have been having some trouble with the Oculus Link as the connection often drops out and it is very hard to even get started playing games. I guess it's still in beta but I also think my computer is too old and my specs are a little low.\n\nThe cheap third party link cable cost me more money than Virtual Desktop but doesn't provide me with a better experience. I would have been better off just sticking with Virtual Desktop as it is now a smooth and dependable app with no disconnections. I also think Virtual Desktop uses less resources than Oculus Link for some reason and it seems to run smoother on my old hardware.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this app to anyone with a reasonable computer and good wifi. I'm also amazed at how active the developer is as he makes sure to keep updating this app while checking on customer feedback. Just make sure to side load the app as per the instructions on the website and don't give 1 star reviews for something that can be fixed so easily.\n\nHelpful | 340", "OrgmirJun 17 at 12:25 AM\nBuy this, play SteamVR games.\n\nThis app is the missing link if you have a quest and a desktop VR rig.

Are you using an ISP provided router or a dedicated one? ISP routers tend to perform poorly. You can also try switching between 40mhz and 80mhz mode on your router; helps with some users.

But once I got everything right with my WiFi and graphic settings for playing Half-Life Alyx... I found the quality is just as good as Oculus Link but without the cables. Haven't bothered with Oculus link since.\n\nIt makes me wonder why Oculus pursued the link instead of this sort of wireless option... I suppose they were just worried that the average user wouldn't be able to negotiate their Wi-Fi settings etc... they might have a point there.\n\nThe whole link thing and then enabling USB 2.0 seems a bit strange. Considering they must have known the data decompression limitations of the quest before release. Weirder even is you would think a massive company like FB/Oculus could develop a decent installer for their desktop app... apparently not. I'm pretty sure it comes down to the fact that the software industry is flooded by mediocre developers... and business decision makers usually can't tell the difference. Fast-talking, bs-artist, clueless developers are everywhere.\n\nAnyway like other people have said this developer seems very active and enthusiastic... Likely has real talent (you are one of the few, it's an awesome concept and it's implemented really well...kudos)\n\nThis is the easiest way to experience PC VR quality without the cables....

It doesn't have much practical use for me. Now if you could link a real physical keyboard and mouse to the Quest and the Quest were able to scan the environment and put the keyboard and mouse in the virtual environment, I'd use this when I go on trips instead of bringing my laptop. I see the potential, but the technology just isn't there yet.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for responding developer. I know that keyboards and mice are supported through Bluetooth, but you can't see them in your virtual environments, can you? Not being able to see them (I don't mean literally see, but a graphical representation of where they are would be nice like the controllers. I don't think that's possible with current technology, but I might be wrong) makes using a keyboard and mouse while in VR difficult. It's not your fault. I think the headset should scan the environment and adapt the VR environment to match it. That's the future, I think. It's just not there yet.\n\nAs for streaming VR games, does it actually make it full screen or are you still limited by the virtual \"monitor\" in the VR environment? I checked out some tutorials and it's unnecessarily complicated to set everything up (Steam, Steam VR, Virtual Desktop, Oculus software, developer mode, side loading, Revive, etc.) I know this isn't your fault, but this really needs to be easier to set up.\n\nI'm not complaining and it's not all on you. I just don't think the technology is there yet. I still would have bought this if nothing else to support the development even though I don't have much use for it right now.

And if I feel like it, I can watch Disney+ on a virtual huge cinema size screen if I like.\nProtip: purchase this app, get a link cable, get your Quest connected to PC, get the Virtual Desktop upgrade from the other Quest site and then remove that cable to start enjoying your Quest to the fullest (as long as you been blessed to have PC that can run PCVR games).\nWell done, developers!\n\nHelpful | 5", "vault_travelerJul 4 at 3:17 PM\nIts really good.\n\nI think its really great, regardless if you go the extra mile or stay vanilla its a must have, it works good but it could be even better.\n\nHelpful | 2", "PortGrYTJul 1 at 11:14 AM\nI'm only doing this Because\n\nI don't know how to use virtual desktop but I'm getting their wish me lock every one that sees this I am going to need it open I do not break my quest :)\n\nHelpful | 0", "huggsbosonJul 9 at 12:09 PM\nAmazing!\n\nWorks flawlessly for using VR from my PC on my untethered headset.

And he is very quick to reply. Now that I have said why the dev is so great ima review the game. Virtual desktop is amazing. There is so much to do like checking your discord messages, watching a movie and then jumping into blades and sorcery to slay some gladiators. The one thing that is a bit hard for people is getting the software running on their pc and having to install sidequest (which is not the developers fault) just to run pcvr. But I have got this running is just about 6 minutes and could start attempting to play pcvr games on my extremely low spec pc ( it didnt work so Im getting a be ready pc). This app/ game does exactly as intended and is great if you have a be ready pc.\n\nSo for those wondering the dev had to move the steam vr streaming software to sidequest because oculus is extremely sensitive to games and will shut down the slightest thing that could and I say COULD be malicious to the headset.

I haven't actually had to request support, but I've benefited from being able to look up questions and answer on the internet that addressed many of the common struggles and questions that I've had.\n\nThis application obviously isn't perfect, but at the moment even the technology is dynamic and improving quickly. In my opinion, Virtual Desktop is a gateway to many more possibilities on the Oculus Quest - and while many of these capabilities SHOULD be native/included features of the Quest (and perhaps one day will be) it shows great knowledge and competence that these devs have created such a useful application.

(The music visualizer background for one, as well as better UX for configuring your screens.)\n\nAnyway, the features I was hoping for are not in both versions. Be careful and do your homework for your virtual desktop: immersed, vspatial, and even the oculus link beta home can do multiple monitors.\n\nIn the mobile version video at 3:11 you can see the UX for trying to enhance the single desktop experience but moving its distance. Compared to the other UI this is an implicit design and without a tutorial I was flailing in VR. Id rather have a sliding toggle. When attempting to move the distance and configurations in the mobile version I was trying to adjust these setting for 15 min before I was annoyed that the distance doesnt explain what movement you need to make on your controller. Do I use the thumb stick... just wave my hand around and press the trigger when Ive had enough...? (Edit: thanks for dev response)\n\nHead lock is cool. Good ideas here, with an alright execution.\n\n(Bonus star for the developer and their non-hesitation to respond to this.)\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper Response7 days ago\n\nHi, the distance of the screen changes in VR, its just not noticeable on a 2D video. Try it in VR, youll see how it affects the depth of the screen. Note that Virtual Desktop renders the desktop at a much higher quality and therefor it cannot do multiple monitors with the current generation of mobile headsets. If you want to use the PC VR version of the app with Oculus Link, you can but the desktop image quality will be far worse as Link adds additional video compression. EDIT: to change the screen distance move your controller left or right (same gesture as when resizing the screen)", "keb55Jul 4 at 6:12 PM\nBlack magic / wireless pcvr\n\nAmazing. Best way to pcvr.

Its extremely seamless. No f***ing around with local IPs, mac addresses or anything of the sort. Download the app on your desktop, enter your username and never touch it again(it runs gets minimized to the system tray). All I have to do is open the app on the quest, hit launch steam vr and BOOM Im playing the steam vr. I was so blown away with the seamlessness so much that I actually restarted my PC AND the quest to see if it would connect just as seamlessly and sure enough it did. Legit just pressed the power button on my desktop, entered my window's password and went in the quest and launched this app. Was legit playing the desktop version of Job Simulator within 30 seconds of hitting the power button on my desktop.\n\nYou dont even have to use Oculus's garbage launcher(which btw also means you cant play your oculus desktop games via this method, I personally dont care, just pointing it out). And the method they use for streaming seems to actually take advantage of the OLED screen of the Quest unlike Oculus Link. Blacks look black in virtual desktop. The only real problem is the accuracy of the controller's tracking. Its fine and didnt really affect my experience but it could be better though Link's controller tracking isnt perfect either.\n\nAnd I dont know if this was just a problem with me but while using Oculus Link, I felt like it was much harder to throw things accurately, or just at all. Again not a problem with virtual desktop. My friend(using a vive) was able to throw things much farther and faster than me(while using link) in Arizona Sunshine. Not a problem with Virtual Desktop.\n\nOne thing i wouldn't get this for is beat saber. It worked ok but i was simply missing too many note blocks for me to play properly. Use link for beat saber.\n\nOHHHH and I cannot stress this enough; The mic actually works with this. Link doesnt allow you to use your mic with your desktop, you have to use a bluetooth mic or one with a long cable. Virtual Desktop allows you to use the Quest's built in mic. Why Facebook hasnt built this functionality in is beyond me but all I can tell you is that it works in Virtual Desktop and it does NOT work in Link.\n\nAlthough I did give this a 5 star keep in mind that it is still a wireless method and it has some of the problems that come with wireless vr solutions but it still works far better than any other wireless vr solution aside from the Vive with its official wireless adapter. Though this is not far off from that\n\ntl;dr definitely worth the 22 cad I paid.\n\nHelpful | 58", "etatechMay 14 at 10:28 PM\nthanksoffline mod save me\n\ncan't find my pc in my quest , with the error mesaage: unable to retrieve your computersI install app from sidequest and already install pc steamer,of course I've save my coulus user name .

No wires, no fear of tripping, no expensive usb port repairs, and best of all, no extra latency. If your PC is capable of running PCVR games, this is an absolute must buy...with a catch. You absolutely NEED to have it set up physically properly before trying to run games. I use an AC1200 powerline adapter to my playspace, then a dedicated 5GHz WiFi network (I use a TPLINK WPA-8630P so it's an all in one) and your PC hard wired to the adapter. Setting the Channel for the WiFi to 80MHz also help big time, as does using an Nvidia GPU with low latency turned to Ultra in Nvidia Control Panel. No extra lag, high bit rates and an overall amazing experience. I've had times where staying in the dark for too long (Pavlov corner camping haha) causes some pixelation in dark areas, and it gets worse and worse until you move, but that's just a streaming thing, and never happens during games. I only wish Stormland would work (pesky pose prediction honestly ruins the entire experience of that game for me,and now it's ruining the way I can experience it - frustrating.)

I just played Half-Life Alyx with it without any problems. It is such a great experience to play high-end VR untethered. I cannot understand why Oculus doesn't support this solution - you have to side-load the actual app version with SideQuest to get the VR functionality because Oculus deems it too unstable and instead pushes it's Link cable solution. But aside from the original cable being pricey and mostly unavailable getting Link to work (with a different cable) was a major pita. Virtual Desktop on the other hand worked out of the box without any problems, with Oculus VR app as well as Steam. And the VR desktop functionality also works very well.\n\nTo be clear, you need a high-end PC, a modern 5 GHz Router and should keep the Quest near to the router for a high-speed connection.

Getting bored of the games on your Quest and want to play your SteamVR games? Just launch VD, get comfortable anywhere in your house (VD is completely wireless!), maybe grab a power bank for good measure, and play to your heart's content. Another handy feature that Virtual Desktop provides is... well... the virtual desktop. It's pretty nice to be able to quickly pop out of a VR game and do something on the desktop before going back into VR, all without taking off the headset. The virtual screen is very customizable, as well, and even has support for various types of 3D content. I recommend playing around with it! Virtual Desktop isn't perfect, however. There are a few things that you will want to take into consideration before buying it. One of the most important things you will need to have a decent experience in VD is a fast connection. Get some kind of wired connection between your PC and router because trust me, YOU WILL NEED IT. Get a Powerline network adapter if running standard Ethernet simply isn't an option. Additionally, I briefly mentioned this earlier, but you might want to have a power bank ready, because especially if you have the settings turned up, VD can be a bit of a battery guzzler. Finally, the last problem with Virtual Desktop is compatibility. Simply put, not all games are going to play nice with it. With some games, you might be able to fiddle around with the various options VD gives you and get it working, but others simply won't cooperate. Thankfully, new games are becoming playable with each new update. Even with these drawbacks though, I consider Virtual Desktop to be absolutely essential for those looking to play SteamVR games on their Quest who, for whatever reason, can't use Oculus Link.\n\nHelpful | 1", "CleverNameWithNumberApr 21 at 11:02 AM\nMust have app for anybody with a Quest\n\nThis works pretty much flawlessly with great video quality and responsiveness.

Buy the app here, then side-load the full version, easy peasy for now but Oculus may stop this too.\n\nFor sure a tether ensures uninterrupted low latency, but if your wireless network is high quality (I have Aruba 802.11ax APs), the latency is so low that you will barely notice the difference, if at all. I get 27ms, which is a acceptable for the freedom it provides.\n\nNote that the wireless stack in the Quest is garbage, and it does drop connection all too often or dip to 2.4GHz, even with strict steering, but this is a well know Oculus defect. A 5Ghz only network is therefore recommended to avoid erroneous steering.\n\nI would like to one day see a regular flat desktop client as the streaming engine is more efficient and lower latency than even SteamLink!

I set up Oculus link with my PC recently and it works great but my kid hated stumbling over the cable on the floor. It also made me nervous on the longevity of the Quest's USB C Port with it getting tugged on. So I decided to hesitantly try this app after hearing good things. I assumed the latency might make it only good for low action things.\n\nI bought the app, installed the secondary version, and fired up half life Alyx. I played for about 2 minutes and \"noped\" out after feeling a bit queasy from the slight lag. I was about to refund this app when I read that there was a bug when using it with Alyx that's fixed with a beta version. I installed the beta and suddenly my mind was blown. It works perfectly over my wifi with no discernable lag. All queasiness I experienced at first was gone and I couldn't tell the difference between using VD or link.\n\nI haven't used my link cable in a week now and couldn't be happier. I'm sure Oculus is working on a wireless version of link, but if they aren't, they should buy the tech from this company, because it works. I imagine your mileage will vary depending on your WiFi setup, but for me it's flawless.\n\nI also want to point out that I can understand Oculus not wanting to carry the version that connects to desktop VR to ensure the best possible experience, but I hope they are working on their own wireless version because at the very least this app proves that it's possible with the right setup.\n\nHelpful | 1", "vinodh4uMay 25 at 11:06 AM\nOffline Computer Discovery Excellent\n\nGreat job.

Their computer desk environment screen is fairly sharp and I can see it being jist sharp enough for many to use as a desktop monitor replacement (though using keyboard and mouse when you can't see is cumbersome and the touch controllers are slow).\n\nStreaming flat screen games and desktop view is fast and easy. Streaming pcvr games after sideloading the modified virtual desktop app via side quest was easy to do.\n\nStreaming pcvr games though is still janky and some games will stream well and some wont. Oculus store games, which VD now supports natively without needing revive, seemed to run better than steam games for me though I'm not sure if that was just luck of the draw.\n\nI've tried oculus link too and I was able to get higher resolutions with VD though the latency is worse on VD by far though latency will vary depending on the networking equipment you have. Latency was actually much better than I expected on my old asus rt-ac66u router. Good enough for shooting and sword fighting games. Not good enough for beat saber on expert plus.\n\nOverall, this app would be an excellent buy if you want a virtual flat screen desktop monitor. It would be a good buy if you want wireless pcvr gaming. But you can't play all pcvr games with this as its still too buggy with some games so I'd still get oculus link in addition to VD.\n\nHelpful | 0", "ricardo.cadenaApr 12 at 11:53 AM\nThe best streaming app on the Quest.\n\nThis is the best streaming app for the oculus quest, good environments and constant support from the developers.

I stumbled across a game review for the quest where the VLogger has used this app to stream a Steam game. I thought I would try it as I have a Vive setup at home as well as the Quest. Well, since then I am now selling the vive. Over my 5Ghz wifi connection with this app running on my Quest (plus the side load) I have a full Steam VR setup but now without the wires! It runs FLAWLESSLY. I mean - absolutely flawlessly. Really. It has given me the best of both worlds - a mobile Quest that I can play anywhere, but then full access to my steam library when at home, and high end games such as Onward or Skyrim VR. Its utterly insane how good this is - I cannot praise it enough. This app alone has made the Quest the absolute perfect headset. Thank you so much developer - this is the finest app I have ever seen on the App Store in terms of being a game changer and the GUI and customisable options are extremely polished.\n\nIm looking forward to the video options, and I hope that theres an option to stream videos from the internet as well as playing locally stored ones.\n\nIf you have a PC powerful enough to run SteamVR and a 5Ghz router, arent afraid of side loading and have a little technical know how, this will be the best app you ever purchase.\n\nHelpful | 41", "Mythicality23 days ago\nGreat app\n\nWorks just as it says and its even better with the sideload-able addition!\n\nHelpful | 0", "kvnchgApr 17 at 1:21 PM\nMust have app\n\nI am able to play Steam VR games flawlessly with VD.

Wireless streaming of Steam VR games. Trying titles like Borderlands VR and Half Life Alyx both on Oculus Link and Virtual Desktop, I was more than happy with the largely unnoticeable latency dip. Being tethered is a massive turnoff for me in VR, even when its mostly kept out of the way, I just never feel truly free to move around without worrying I'm gonna yank some cable sideways and damage the headset. Being able to play AAA PCVR games wirelessly as if they were designed for the Quest is well worth the money alone (even though I am aware that other programmes offer this for free).\n\nIt's here that my only gripe surfaces, I own a Go, Quest, Rift and a PC powerful enough to run Oculus Link, so naturally I would benefit from Virtual Desktop on all three platforms, but frustratingly there is absolutely no effort to make any of the applications cross-buy, meaning I have to buy all 3 versions if I want to make use of VD on my other headsets.\n\nThis left a very sour taste and is not something I will support any further by sinking more money in to the same application on multiple storefronts. I at the very least expected cross-buy between the Quest and Rift versions. Looks like I'll stick to Oculus Home or one of the other free alternatives.\n\nIf you have multiple headsets and you're buying this thinking it will solve all your desktop needs, please think twice, cause that reality could end up costing you a whole lot more of your hard earned money than it would ever be worth!\n\nUpdate: Many devs offer Go or Rift keys to customers who can prove their purchase, especially if the Quest version is the most expensive, such as yours. Its very easy to put all the blame on Oculus but there are ways to support such customers.\n\nHelpful | 0\nDeveloper ResponseJul 2 at 7:57 AM\n\nHi, Oculus is to blame here; they dont support cross-buy between Go and Quest. I had planned to do cross-buy with Go since it is the same app as on Quest. Sadly they ended up not supporting that. The mobile version of the app is completely different from the PC version; I started from scratch with the mobile version as it uses a different engine, different graphics API and different Oculus SDK. I also update the app constantly and will continue to do so free of charge.

After reading a few of the reviews, I decided to give this a go (it's less than the price of a cable as others have pointed out) and I am truly blown away. My wifi is pretty good, but the experience wasn't all that great, so I cabled my PC to my router, and the performance is staggering.

After spending quite a few hours playing with settings and trying things, I discovered that on my laptop the screen resolution was not set to the recommended settings. I reset it to the recommended settings, and suddenly this application works like it is supposed to. One of the really great things about this app is that I am able to view my side by side 3D pictures properly as a 3D image which to me is just amazing. It is one of the main reasons I wanted to get this application. Also for overall viewing of pictures and photos and not having to put them on my actual Oculus Quest. Right now I need to tweak the video settings just to Tad because it's a little glitchy. I am not plugged into the actual router and so I expect this needs just a little bit of tweaking on my end. Now, I can't say enough good about this application. I am looking forward to the day when I am able to view my 360 photos and videos properly in a 360 environment. That would really put this over the top. I will be using this application a lot. Also, I would like to thank the Developers for trying to help me figure this out.\n\nUpdate: to the Developers, I hate to tell you this but every time I open this app it resets my computer's screen resolution causing it to go to 1/4 of the screen. Now that I know what is going on, I am able to fix this every time. However, it is annoying to have to keep on resetting my screen resolution. I hope this is something you can resolve. I truly am a big fan of this app and will use it either way. If there is a way that I can stop the screen resolution from resetting on my end, I am willing to try different things. I guess the real question is, can this be fixed on your end or my end? If you have any thoughts on this please let me know.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseDec 15 at 9:07 AM\n\nHi, thanks for the update, glad you were able to figure out the issue. 360 videos is a feature Im working on.

If all the points you mentioned are verified by penetration testing I will give it 5 stars. If you would like to be part of this test effort feel free to make your recommendations on testing methods to verify your claims. An FAQ on security is advised for this app. With question such as Can this work over VPN.

If this is not possible or not tested yet you should state that. I lowered my rating as I no longer trust your claims until you reveal a proven method for VPN support. Ideally you should provide your application for the Quest and PC as open source so that it can be scrutinized, built and deployed with high trust.

Feel free to reach out to me for specific questions: guy@vrdesktop.net EDIT: it can work over VPN as long as you can establish a direct connection between the Quest and your computer. It is end to end encryption yes as all the traffic remains direct without any intermediary. EDIT 2: It doesnt create a VPN on its own; you asked if it worked over a VPN: it does as long as your headset and computer are on the same VPN.

It normally shows up when you enter text fields but if it doesnt, you can right-click the taskbar and enable the Show touch keyboard button to have a button to bring it up manually. I will be adding a binding to the X button on the left touch controller to show the keyboard in the next update.
