But I looked at all the games action and decided to take a shot in the dark, and Im glad I did!\n\nThis game isnt very scary, I mean sure it has some tense moments but they dont end in something horrific, I only found one Jumpscare that scared the socks off me and my brother who tried the game. Anyone who has played will know which one Im talking about.\n\nThe melee weapons are a treat. You can alter the direction you hold them, and you can even hold weapons like axes with two hands which (coming from someone who has never experienced this) is an absolute treat to be able to swing at enemies while holding on to my weapons in an awesome and new way.\n\nThe ranged weapons are also very cool, each and every one of them has a specific way of reloading them and they all have their pros and cons which can make it difficult to decide whether you want to take a pistol or a revolver.\n\nNo one gonna read this all the way but I like writing so eh, but if you did then you are a certified cool kid :D have an epic day frend.\n\nHelpful | 370", "theoryofeverywhere24 days ago\nOne of the Most Complete Games on Quest\n\nI love this game. It is brutally difficult at times, even on the Normal difficulty level. This is one of the few games on Quest which feels complete. Its a long game by VR standards and has an intriguing story. The presentation is excellent and the tension you feel during the game is so intense at times. The music coupled with the sound effects make for a very unsettling experience. There are only maybe one or two times I had a proper jump scare in this game so one does not need to worry too much about that. But the game is creepy. I have played Exorcist and Dreadhalls, and this is a far better, scarier horror game. I have also played Journey of the Gods and this is a far more satisfying adventure/action game. I cant recommend this game enough, but be prepared for a challenge!\n\nHelpful | 20", "Robertobob100Jul 17 at 10:52 PM\nYou should make lies beneath 2!\n\nThis game was so well though out in that it has chapters and an amazing storyline that keeps you \"reading to find out more\" or should I say surviving to find out more. I wish there was a second game with more chapters.\nIt could be like in a series and \"Lies beneath 2\" would be the same thing with the monsters and amazing combat but a different story. I think it would be another hit!\n\nI hope the developers can reply on this review and let me know their thoughts on this idea of a second lies beneath game. I have some cool storylines in mind that would make a great lies beneath 2 game.\n\nI do a bit of game design myself but I can't imagine how much time, dedication, effort and patients it takes to make something like this.\n\nThank you for providing an amazing vr experience. Well worth the price.\n\nHelpful | 17", "Dopho20 days ago\nI never write reviews but...\n\nIll start off by saying this is probably one of the best oculus quest games out there. Its really good as a game in general, the graphics are some of the best on the quest and work together so nicely. I will be honest this game scares me $hitless every time I play, but it does so through atmosphere, not jump scares. Im on chapter 6 and have been through 2 jump scares, which fit well and were scary. Basically just buy this game because you wont regret it.\n\nHelpful | 6", "BennyHaunna3Jul 6 at 3:06 PM\nGeez man\n\nWhat a great game. This game is my favorite game on the oculus quest store hands down. Great story, check. Great gameplay, check. Great weapons that are all fun to use, check. This game has everything, its so fun. Worth every penny. If you are thinking about getting it, I will warn you. It is a bit scary, so if you arent into that, then maybe think of something else, if you dont mind it, then get it for sure. I love this game so much and I am excited to see more. Devs, if youre reading this, this game is awesome, but there is some things that I do want.\n\n-more weapons\nCome on, who wouldnt want more weapons. I havent played through the whole game yet but maybe something like a bow would be really cool.\n\n-modes\nI know this game is story based, but maybe there can be some type of other endless arena mode that you kill a lot of monsters then burn a doll to move onto the next round or something. You should also have more than enough ammo, enough to where you run out so you can still melee and have fun with that, but enough to where you dont have to really worry about losing ammo. I just thought that would be cool.\n\n-customization\nHear me out. I know a lot of things in this game do not need customization but maybe something like changing the color of your gloves would be cool.\n\n-co-op mode\nThis would be so fun to go through the whole game in co-op. Maybe even a different story that you have to play in co-op.\n\nThis game is awesome so keep adding more things, I love it so much and you put a lot of work into this game. Thank you and I hope to see more in the future.\n\nHelpful | 16", "Balakae.exeJun 8 at 1:22 PM\nOh my god....\n\nThis game is hands down, my new favorite vr game (and Ive played boneworks!). The story is amazing even though I was confused with the ending Im gonna go back so I can figure it out. The graphics are insane for the quest, they are very simple but the way the drifter team pulled it off is amazing. The mechanics, dont even get me started... THEYRE SO GOOD! you can hold 2 handed weapons, the 9mm can be reloaded like an actual gun or you can just push the mag, THEY GIVE YOU CHOICES! The interactivity is amazing, although I wish there was a bit more, I know its not easy so the games still amazing. This game is by far the best experience on the quest from the graphics to the len- oh yea, that too: the length of the game is about 5-6 hours, for me it was longer cause Im bad XD. Anyway its a truly amazing game and I cant wait to see future updates. Speaking of that hear is a recommendation:\n\nHorde mode: There should be a horde mode so there can be replay ability in the game, the further you go the more guns and ammo, maybe with multiplayer but if no multiplayer, thatll still be awesome.\n\nKeep up the great work guys and thank you for this memorable game :)\n\nHelpful | 52", "Evagrius77720 days ago\nA graphical marvel!\n\nA VR experience that deserves a 5 star rating! This title has a mysterious and eerie story line, engaging and creepy action, and some of the best graphical quality the quest has to offer. I originally purchased and deleted this app almost immediately because I found it too far scary for my taste. After reading numerous reviews and watching recorded play through videos, I decided to try the game again. Apparently the exposure better prepared me to work through the fear and enjoy the game. Im not a horror fan by any stretch, but once you get conditioned to the frightening music and small number of jump scares the unique art style, creative narrative, and incredible gameplay make it well worth it!!!\n\nHelpful | 4", "Brownstreak126 days ago\nAmazing just one thing\n\nI absolutely love this game because of its mix of action, horror, and great art style. It has an okay story but its still lots of fun. Im stuck on one part and i cant remember what chapter but its around the 39% mark. its right after you see the witch woman with no head in the tunnel and then burn the doll. Once the doll is burned everything goes back to normal but when I flick my lighter it just goes straight up. I walked up the stairs where at the top it says something about a good luck charm, and then I went past all the spider creatures onto the boat and killed that one big dude. After all that it sill kept going straight up and then led me back to the save barrels right before you enter the town. I dont know what to do and if I could have help that would be very helpful thank you.\n\nHelpful | 0", "Ferret4209Jun 18 at 10:34 AM\nFantastic experience!\n\nDisclaimer: I am NOT a horror veteran. I love the genre and have a lot of knowledge about horror games, but this is the first true \"horror\" game I've owned.\n\nI've only played this game for about 2 hours, but I've loved every second of it! The art style is perfect for the Quest, really maximizing the art with the graphics available. The story so far has been excellent, and I'm constantly searching for secrets in every chapter. Combat has been really smooth, and I have no complaints about gameplay. The audio design is also amazing!\n\nAs far as horror goes, this is not the scariest game out there, partially because the weapons help you have some measure of confidence. This means that even if you're not the biggest fan of scary, you can probably handle it. It is scary, and it does deliver some good jumpscares and does keep you constantly on edge, but it's not to the point that most people can't handle playing it. It does give me some Resident Evil vibes both in the gameplay and in the general level of scariness (comparable to RE7, maybe?)\n\n*I have never played the Resident Evil games, but I have watched complete playthroughs of 1,2,3 and 7*\n\nI haven't explored many of the horror games on the Quest, but this is certainly the best one.\n\nAll in all, this is a must- buy for any fan of horror, a great story, or even fans of FPS games. It's easily been the most engaging and immersive experience I've played on the Quest. Definitely my favorite game available. Thank you to the developers for making such an amazing game! !\n\nHelpful | 16", "BeamyRacccoon24214 days ago\nVery spooky\n\nI think the game looks absolutely amazing!! It gives me that borderlands/ comic book feel.\nIt was so scary that I needed a friend to play it with so I wouldnt feel alone.

The artwork, music and use of lighting/atmosphere is truly fantastic! The story builds throughout the game (20 chapters-Long game play :) which always keeps you guessing and piecing it together as you collect items, etc. This Psychological horror/survival game was way better then I originally intended it to be.\n\nRecommend wearing headphones while playing to get full surround sound.\n\n10/10 would recommend!! \n\nHelpful | 2", "devinbrosephApr 2 at 5:12 AM\nWow...\n\nThis game is the first game Ive been excited for in a while, and for good reason.

Like half life, its a very story driven game that involves shooting plenty of enemies. As a bonus, its got some cool melee as well. The graphics are fantastic and beautiful in their own right. If you like comics or manga, you'll like this for how the story is portrayed. It is absolutely scary, but also exciting and fun for the combat aspect. It honestly gave me one of the biggest adrenaline rushes in my entire life, and I'm only 5 chapters in. I'm definitely looking into the developers who made this, looking forward for more games!\n\nHelpful | 2", "ColdTurkeyJul 9 at 8:03 PM\nBest game on quest\n\nThis game is amazing if you are into the action and shooter genre then just get it. I you like horror just get it. There are a couple jump scares but if you look up where they are then you will be fine. It took me 12 or so hours to beat and it is super challenging but fun.

I mean all of it. Has dark and beautiful story telling. I felt what the main character felt the whole way through, mainly because I mentally went through the same thing, but not as fun. When I was getting to the end of the story. I felt familiar pains. I wanted to cry at some points because the story was told in a way that I could connect it to when I went through it. The developers did a beautiful job.\n\nIf anyone that's interested in trying the game reads my rating just buy the game. It's filled with action and a story.\n\nAnd to the devs. Thank you for such an emotional ending. I loved it even though it was so heart felt. I'm trying not to spoil anything and I hope I didn't for the new players that experience this game.\n\nThis is one that hit me hard and kept me on my toes.

Go figure! Too immersive. That said, I have had this game on my wishlist for a while. I just thought the style seemed very cool, and I liked that it was a full game with a story. So I eventually bit the bullet and bought it.\n\nThis game is very creepy and atmospheric. I forced myself to play through it in short bursts. I appreciated that there were varying difficulties you could choose from, because I played it on easy and was happy with that. That way I could play through the story, be creeped out, but not overwhelmed.\n\nI like the comic book style, and although linear, the game is really fun to play. I did find inventory management difficult to handle in pressured situations, though.\n\nThat said, this game took me somewhere between 6 to 10 hours to play, and I enjoyed it. I'm not entirely sure because I lost track of time while playing. I do wish there was more story explanation though, because by the ending, it still wasn't clear to me.\n\nThis would be five stars, but I removed one start due to a bug that I experienced. At the very end of the game, you read a comic book, but I could not do that to complete the game because the weapons from the previous scene were stuck in my hands. I have read reviews, and other people experienced similar. I had to replay the final fight scene all over again just to beat the game.\n\nBut overall, this game is definitely worth your money. And even if you don't like or play horror in VR, force yourself to experience this one!\n\nHelpful | 0", "ZethriaJul 22 at 7:32 PM\nAmazing\n\nPerfect game, the environment is nice and creepy and the gameplay is fun.

The cartoon style is so well done, that I never felt done with it, and the art style continued to captivate me to the very end.\n\nThe game had a creepy feeling, and at times it scared me, but I never felt that it was too scary. It had a sort of throw back feeling to good old horror entertainment. Something I do not often see. The game is overflowing with originality and beauty. The weapons and enemies are awesome, the environments are awesome and the story is awesome.\n\nOnly thing I did not like as much is that there were some bugs in the game. At the end I had to retry the final chapter because my character would not let go of her weapon and lighter at the end, which hindered me in grabbing things.\n\nHowever, the bugs were few and far between. I would easily recomend this to any and every horror fan.

It's thrilling it's fun and it keeps you pulled in. I've wanted a semi scary game for awhile but all I get reccomended is cliche zombie shooters that really aren't that great (yes I mean the one in the store). I'm not even 5 chapters in and I'm in love. The art style feels modern but indie and I couldn't imagine it any other way. It's got a quirky comic book style that I thouroughly enjoy.

It's amazing.\n\nHelpful | 3", "ashton.gee.94 hours ago\nReally good game\n\nOnly a few jump scares, but youll be on edge the whole game. Has a good amount of content for a VR game\n\nHelpful | 0", "lotsotech15 days ago\nFull-length horror action\n\nTo its credit, this is a pretty dark and thematic horror title. I'm playing on easy and given the bugs with the controls I'm glad I did. At least at this difficulty this isn't a \"survival\" game where you never have enough resources, instead you're typically tearing through the enemy hordes until you find the next save point/cache where you can restock your ammo.\n\nGraphically, the flat pulp style graphic do a decent job of covering the very low poly count. Occasionally you might catch yourself looking at some blobby thing not totally sure what it is.\n\nI gave this 4 out of 5, but it's probably more like a 3.5/5. Despite what I like about it, the control are pretty awful. I've literally watched weapons just fly away, switch hands or just disappear altogether. Dropping something on the ground is a death sentence for it as the terrain just gobbles it up. Also the game bases your \"back\" as behind your POV and not between your hands. So when you look to your side you weapons move even futher, more awkwardly behind you. Playing seated is a challenge, I'd recommend a low back chair with no arms. Otherwise you'll be in the middle of combat and not be able to reach your holster.\n\nOne more plus, melee combat is pretty satisfying. Weapons still like to fly away or get stuck in enemies (this is probably intentional if not poorly implemented). However there are some satisfying thuds and what not which makes hand to hand feel really immersive.\n\nI definitely weighted the overall package moreso than the control issues, but I think if you're prepared for the worst, you'll know what you're getting yourself in for.\n\nEdit: Also forgot to mention that I find the smooth movement to be a little worse than Half-Life: Alyx. I can't seem to ever quite get to a point where I'm not nauseous. Guessing there's probably some tracking that's just not quite dialed in. Be prepared to chew off 30 minutes or so at a time until you need a break.\n\nHelpful | 0", "HAMMYham3.014 days ago\nIm so sad\n\nThe game is really good love the art style of the story love the action but my dumb deleted message me when I finish the game so now it looks like I did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpful | 0", "Meh_AustinJun 29 at 5:53 PM\nBest Game Ive Played on Oculus Quest\n\nThis game is just baffling, and it has 6-7 hours of gameplay.

I wont even tell you what color the sky is!\n\nThis game has showed me, these devs are finally understanding the hardware.\n\nWhat they can do with these shaders given the system limitations - is insane. Talent \n\nThis game revealed to me.. a whole new generation of *getting us hooked* games are on the way.\n\nLies Beneath in my eyes is the Half Life Alyx for Quest. (As in a groundbreaking game for this limited, constrained, hardware)\n\nWhat I am saying... the cohesiveness of the mechanics & design make some fluid in-game systems, and because of that, its ground breaking.\n\nLies Beneath has sent out warning shots   to all other game studios.\n\nThis title, is going to force all other game devs to step their game up, now that we consumers know whats possible on this hardware.\n\nBefore the review..\nLets get the ugly bugs out the way 1st.\n\nDrifter studios is reading and they move swift! See updates below.\n\n\n- - - - BUGS OR DESIGN OVERSIGHT - - -\n\nBLACK SCREEN BUG [FIXED]\nAppears when we are within the invisible colliders of an object. It seems way off, I am no where near said object and black screen triggers. This really needs to be addressed. Happens a lot.\n\n*UPDATE 1*\nApril 2nd - Dev responded fix will be incoming soon via update!  Fast response. They are on it!\n\n*UPDATE 2*\nApril 3rd - Devs released TWO micro updates in the last two days. WOW! I am happy to report BLACK SCREEN is now fixed! Player will no longer experience an abrupt screen blackout instead.. your screen will granularly fade to black. Non intrusive, non ajarring. Very natural and gentle.\n\nBasically the further you move into a solid object (wall, table, chair.. etc) the game slowly blackens out your screen. This is letting you know, back away.\n\nQUAINT ROOM CHAPTER BLACK SCREEN BUG [FIXED]\nFixed via second update. See above^\n\nTHROWING WEAPON BUG:\nGame thinks we are throwing or releasing melee weapon sometimes, grip button was never released, therefore Axe, Knife.. etc gets stuck onto the object we strike with weapon.\n\nCROUCHING HEIGHT BUG:\nPhysically crouching in the game makes you taller, thanyour real world height.\n\n\nCONTINUE QUAINT ROOM BUG:\n(extra lite spoiler)\nWithout spoiling exactly whats going on, for players that are reading, let me be as vague as possible.\n\nWhen you die, and restart..\n*Players will be spawned back in mid battle*\n\nwith barely any ammo, none of the *setups* you put in place, when you died, no longer there when you spawn back in.\n\nPlayers if you encounter this bug, heres what you do to bypass it. To start over without being spawned inside mid battle:\n\ngo to main menu/ choose your save/ choose quaint room chapter/ and you will start at the beginning of quaint room pre-battle.\n\n\nPAUSING GAME OR ENTERING MENUS BUG:\nWhen player pauses game, then resumes.. player looses orientation, they resume game facing an entirely different perspective. Extremely jarring. Creates confusion.\n\n\n\n\nREVIEW TIME..\n\n-INTUITIVE SMART DESIGN & MECHANICS-\n\nNATURAL HUMAN PERCEPTION & SENSATIONS:\nAll of these are activated when in the act of doing something. Many games on the Quest fail at triggering these immersive receptors as significantly and dramatically as Lies Beneath does. (I own about 70% of the top selling quest games)\n\nLet me explain...\n\nIm chopping wood in the game, the haptics are so perfectly aligned with my swings, it communicates with my mind and says.. HEY! this is the end point of your axe downward swing dont you feel it? So go ahead pull it out and chop down again.\n\nThe haptics do an amazing job conveying the realistic physics into the mind, thus, letting the mentals create the rest of the illusion for your body to feel.\n\n\nThis is NOT easy to speak onto a players mind in VR and as I am saying this.. do keep in mind they are doing this on 2-3 year old snapdragon chipset and with limited hardware capabilities. They are within constraints.\n\nLies Beneath has done what you would call Art of Code this is some Picasso type of code levels. When its all said and done - Drifter needs to place this code block on a art gallery and frame it   This is that good.\n\nLot of games, do not provide this kind of physical organics feedback because of its difficulty. Hence, most games feel as if youre swinging at air, gliding across the ground or just not quite in tune with realitys version, of said sensation, to that action you are committing. Basically.. uncanny.\n\nThe only other games that I feel come close in this regard is Simulator Series, Red Matter and the recently released The Room to name a few.\n\nDrifter, I bend the knee, and pledge fealty you killed it here.\n\n\n\n3D AUDIO\nYou will pull up an ear muff because you think its in your house.\n\n\n\nFEAR FACTOR\nLegit! All those franchises you recall when going down memory lane:\n\nH.P. Lovecraft Cthulhu, Resident Evil, Alien Isolation, Dead Space, Amnesia the Dark, Outlast, Five Nights at Freddys... whatever is your cup of tea;\n\nbest believe Lies Beneath will be sharing that same shelf alongside those titles.\n\n\n\nPACING\nMan oh man! I have always said pacing in VR is wicked important.\n\nStick close to the human perception and familiarity when it comes to the physics of pacing/movement and watch how quick the human mind dips itself into your lake of immersion.\n\nThis game oozes with perfect pacing. There are some splashes of above normal speeds every here and there, but thats ok. You want to sprinkle Intensity around to keep the cadence fresh and spontaneous.\n\n\nSOUND - ATMOSPHERE - MOOD\nTake your time.. dont rush, take in the scenery, the sounds and watch how this world will *absorb you*\n\nThey did such an amazing job with the atmosphere, mood. Dont waste your *1st contact experience* by speeding through.\n\nGood job here Drifter. Give your level designer, 3D Artist and Sound Crew MAD PROPS\n\nThey set the stage!\n\nThis symphony of audio & visuals - grabs everyone upon first contact.\n\nYoure immediately hypnotized. No hype. Just excitement from being on the ride.\n\nLook at the overwhelming response by most.\n\nYou got a few haters.. but thats everywhere. What matters is the ratio. This game has pleased the majority of those that invested into it.\n\nThats a good sign and they deserve it!\n\nWhen you play, you can tell a lot of soul, passion and labor went into getting this developed for us to enjoy this gift... of a vision.\n\n\n\nSURVIVAL\nThey nailed this one. For all you survival heads (play this on hard) thats where I started and still in there. Its perfect. Especially if you have 10x10ft or more. A wonderful, engaging, surreal experience.\n\nHard difficulty is not hard because they just made the Ai more difficult. What Lies Beneath hard difficulty, is hard because resources are truly scarce. Doesnt handicap you. Makes you rely on all youve learned\n\nHaving to use your mind and manage resources... while in the middle of fear! In case you havent survived in real life.. This is exactly what it feels like! Managing while in fear!\n\nThat said.. scarcity is the mother of all skill & invention, which leads to my next bit...\n\n\nORGANIC LEVELING\nNo, there is no progress and gaining abilities. The skills come from when you gain understanding of the mechanics they put in place. One of those, easy to learn but hard to master type deals. Yea, thats in here.\n\n\nYou will find yourself at first **kind of ** understanding whats going on because the simplicity of the mechanics is so well done, it touches your minds spectrum of familiarity.. so.. yea you get it.\n\nYoull quickly recognize the weapons, a little while after youll gain insight on enemy attack patterns, a little while after youll come to realize not all the eerie music means something is going to creep up on you.\n\nThen eventually youll attain techniques on holding more weapons than the slot limit allows. 2 on hand, 2 in the slots. You then learn to throw those melee weapons and create combos, even learning how to get assassination instant kills.\n\nAbout 2-3 hours in, all these systems creep into your minds crevice and your body eventually grabs on to that knowledge.\n\nYoull find yourself *on reaction* start performing all these physical actions you learned, that they built you up for slowly as you progressed. Again - on reaction, straight gangsta!\n\nAnd its at this point, though in fear, you will recognize your skills and you will confidently rely on them, because yea.. you just found out - you are about that life.\n\nJust dont get arrogant these monsters will lay you out. So many patterns to look out for, when they start arriving in groups.\n\nWithin 4 solid hours of me playing. I started feeling like a demon hunter (still scared asf) for I knew, it could be over at any moment.\n\n\nCOMBAT\nHas a splash of Dark Souls, Bloodborne or if you play iOS games - Pascals Wager. Its in here with combat. So yea, gear up!\n\nLook for patterns, get yo combo strings together.\n\nPlant those axes & wood daggers onto neighboring tress or wood surfaces. Theyll stay there.\n\nUse them as grab and throw combo tactics or keep nearby while in middle of combat in case you need to grab something real quick because out of ammo.\n\nDont forget, that weapon you threw at enemy.. that got stuck in their body, you can retrieve from them when they die afterwards or you can pull it out of them while in battle.\n\nSo many combo options here. Experiment!\n\n\nSTORY\nMasterpiece for what it is. Very well done. Nicely opens up for you a bit, at a time. No overwhelming you with it.\n\nDo get the lore pieces so you can delve further, in small chunks on what is going on.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nIf this game does not sell Superhot or Beatsaber numbers. I have no idea whats going on with people.\n\nThis is a classic. I look forward to this becoming a franchise and seeing future parts to this.\n\nBuy this game, support talent when you come across it. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.\n\nCast it on your TV, have someone watch you play and theyll be in tears  as you start letting out high pitch yells! This game will do it to you.\n\nHelpful | 132", "quanster7621 days ago\nKeeps you on your toes\n\nI love the concept of this game and I feel a sense of unease throughout. This is what Id hoped.

The monsters are creepy and often unsettling, resulting in a decent verity of foes. Bosses are also very enjoyable and satisfying to defeat. The Protagonist you play as also has her way of lifting scared spirits with a snarky comment here and there.\n\nShooting mechanics are great, ditching the whole manual loading system for something more arcade-like. Sure that was a bit of a turn off when hearing that you dont manually load shotgun shells or pistol rounds but it works really well and helps amp up the action.\n\nIf youre looking for puzzles, you might be disappointed. However there are a few head scratchers the puzzles are very straight forward; put the hook on the loop. Even though they are a bit upsetting its still a very welcome part of the gameplay between exploring and shooting. There is also a decent variety of guns in this game. Just enough to level out the playing field and make the experience special.\n\nEnvironments and ambiance is key to making a good horror game and this game delivers ten-fold. There were parts I found myself imagining things in the fog that werent there (like seriously, no enemies or scripted figures, just imagination). Although there is a few stock-sounds and jump scares, nothing is scarier than having to enter the dark armed with a lighter and a pistol while hearing sounds coming from god knows where. The world is also pretty big and beautifully designed, even on the Quest I found the graphics to be top tier.\n\n\nOne of the few problems I had with the game was accidentally dropping stuff. Inventory is scarce, giving you only 4 slots. Two for melee weapons, pistols, and healing items. Two for larger firearms. And 1 other but its only for the lighter (the best item in the game! Seriously use the lighter any chance you get). The placement of these spots are in great places, pretty much holsters on your hips and back, but Ive found myself going to place back a pistol or healing item into the holster and waking a fair distance, encountering an enemy and reaching for my gun only to realize its not there and the holster never detected it when I went to place it. Its easy to misplace items and accidentally leave them behind, but lost items always return at some checkpoints so its not all bad. Ive only had it happen to me a few times so its not that big of a deal.\n\nRegardless, if youre looking for something action packed, story driven, unique in terms of art direction, and scary, then buy this game. Its well worth the money. Not only was it one of the best VR games I love played, its one of the best horror games Ive played in general. Youre not going to find Resident Evil or Silent Hill on the Quest (at this time July 2020), but this is the closest you can get!\n\nHelpful | 0", "LASERTEETH7 days ago\nGreat art style, great game\n\nHats off to the developers for this one.

Graphics and environments are well done. The monsters are creepy and quite creative. Random jump scares will keep you on your toes too. The sound effects and the soundtrack also ratchet up the tension.\nii. You can tailor the difficulty to your liking. I tend to play on the easiest settings because I'm more interested in exploring, and getting on with the story than button mashing.\niii. There are lots of opportunities to save your game.\n\nCONS:\ni. The story is vague. There's an initial setup, and then you are just wandering around locations and dealing with waves of monsters. Along the way there nods to the story, but I couldn't put it together. Maybe some exposition scenes to more clearly explain things?\nii. You are the only character. It could have used some secondary human characters to interact with.\niii. It needed some periodic humour to lighten it up. After awhile the perpetually gloomy settings started to become oppressive.\niv. It could have used more puzzles to add some variety. There are a few as you get deeper into the game.\nv. I encountered a few glitches in the game...looping animations that required a re-boot, one time all my weapons inexplicably disappeared...\nvi. Illogical changes to the game play.

It drops you right into a mysterious horror comic book and I love it.\n-Guns: All of the guns are varied and fun to use. Especially the speargun that you get near the end of the game. Although it is useless in combat, it feels great to use it to open up paths and pull dolls towards you.\n-Boss fights: I loved the boss fights. Each one was unique and a lot of fun.\n\nCons:\n-Inventory: It limits you to four inventory slots. Two of them can only hold a shotgun or speargun. The other two can hold pistols and other items you find in the world. This is not enough. Limited gun ammo as well.\n-Difficulty: This game is unnecessarily difficult. limits supplies and throws too many enemies at you at once. Enemies do too much damage even on normal.\n-Melee combat: Mostly useless. You don't do much damage and enemies kill you in a few hits. Not a good combination.\n-Grab mechanic: very hard to grab what you want to in some situations, costing you precious time.\nBugs: some very frustrating bugs that can kill you instantly. And one game-breaking bug at the end that is preventing me from completing the game.\n\nYou can tell the devs put a lot of love and care into this game, but missed the mark in terms of gameplay.

The smooth movement is great and I have not had a single tracking issue.\n\nThis game is best played in short bursts.

There was only one point where I felt like the game just didnt give you enough to actually make it through the area but other than that it felt like as long as I paid attention to what was going on and how much ammo I had I would be fine. My only other small complaint is the grabbing which can be a bit wonky at times as it tries to grab wherever your hand is facing so sometimes if you try to grab something it just wont work.\nAll in all its a great game that I totally recommend, none of the enemies feel to powerful and it keeps a very haunting vibe as you slowly uncover what happened. It also highly encourages playing multiple times over as there are tons of lore objects to find.\n\nHelpful | 0", "DukefromearthJun 28 at 5:04 AM\nSurprising!\n\nAwesome horror action experience.

Easily my favorite Quest game!!\n\nThis game is AMAZING! The game is so fun and enjoyable. I saw another review that said don't let the horror hold you back. I totally agree to that, however, if you are EXTREMELY sensitive to horror then of course I would steer clear. I myself am not sensitive to it, I just get pretty scared when playing horror VR games and while I have had a few anxious moments I loved them! The game handles them sooo well.\n\nThe combat is very very good, the gunplay is very solid, the reload for the revolver (the only firearm I have so far, will update later) is not super realistic, you flick the cylinder open, it displays your ammo count, you flick it shut and it loads. Pretty simple, easy to do, and fits the game well. The melee combat is awesome, there are some quirks to the hitboxes but eventually you learn to handle melee weapons well. I did have an issue with two handed melee where say I swing an axe with two hands the axe will rotate and the blunt side will connect not doing much damage. Stick to one handed, it works great.\n\nThe visuals are amazing. Obviously they are not photo realistic but the art style that is attempted, comic book art, is PERFECTLY executed. The atmosphere is great, the comic book dialogue is great.\n\nThe movement is well implemented, you have snap movements, teleport, smooth, I personally use Smooth Locomotion and it works great. The only odity is crouching. When I tried to crouch it readjusted my height and when I stood up I was about 12 feet tall, don't fret though, it takes about 2 seconds for the game to correct itself. I just wish I could crouch even if it does nothing mechanically but for immersion but it doesn't matter to me.\n\nMy honest opinion is this is the best game on Quest currently. It feels like a complete experience. The game I enjoyed most closely to this one is Super Hot VR. I can't wait for this to come to Rift, I will more than likely be replaying it on the Rift S. I can't recommend this game more.\n\nHelpful | 43", "HM9723 days ago\nOne of my bwst game ever\n\nI wish all horror games like this, sor sure its the best game ever\n\nHelpful | 0", "j_aem_13Jul 12 at 3:31 AM\nAdvanced zombie game\n\nTo address some of the other views expressed here (and as somebe who has played these) no this game is not in the same league as Half life Alyx or Boneworks. Both of those beat this hands down in terms of interactivity, weapon variety, graphics and so on.\nThis is a good game with a decent (around 3 hour) length. It's a sort of arcadey survival horror with a good melee system. Sharp objects react to being swung and hitting things realistically, a great step up for quest zombie games (Arizona sunshine's main game omits melee). It's very scary and the enemies and jump scares (of which there are lots - not sure why some other reviews claimed there's only one) are very strong.\nPart of this though is due to the foggy, muddy graphics. I'm not sure if it's due to the quest's processing power or an attempt to use the short draw distance to hide enemies, or both. Textures as always aren't great and the game did crash on my set multiple times.\nThe graphics are a sort of cell shaded 13 homage which looks cool. Levels are really odd in my opinion, with small open areas and linear gauntlets. The indoors areas are terrifying and intimidating due to their use of poor light.\nEnemies are not the most inventive - they're lovecraftian zombies - and once you get used to dying (and you will a lot, because of your low health) it takes some of the immersive fear out.\nI personally prefer Arizona sunshine as an experience. This is a great effort, but like AZ, would not command its asking price if it was not in VR.\n\nHelpful | 3", "igniteboiJul 20 at 9:45 PM\nLove the graphics and the gameplay\n\nNot a true horror fan but love intense action?

I can honestly say this is quite possibly the scariest game Ive ever played. I only recently started it and theres already been multiple times where Ive had to take a break and set down the goggles from being too freaked out even though I wanted to see what was next. And its not all just jump scares either. Despite its somewhat primitive graphics, it still somehow manages to convey the feeling of being in a horror movie better than anything Ive ever experienced before. The soundtrack is almost perfect and only adds to the intensity. There are times where you can see what youre going to have to deal with ahead of time and youre still scared sh..less when you come face to face with it. If the next one has better graphics and fixes some of the minor movement/control issues (which really arent bad at all compared to some other be games Ive played) it could quite possibly be a perfect game. Ive heard that The Exorcist VR is the scariest game there is so thats next on my list but for now, this will keep me peeing my pants into the wee hours of the morning for the foreseeable future. Get it if you like to be creeped out (which I do obviously). Dont if you dont. Youll hate it.\n\nHelpful | 2", "42ApplesJul 10 at 2:56 AM\nGood but not perfect\n\nI would give this game 4.5 stars I could but it is not quite worth a 5 imo. The game has a lot of creepy moments without relying too heavily on jumpscares. The art style and music is great too. The game took me longer than I expected and has even more replay value with its collectibles and difficulty levels if you want to go there.\n\nThe 2 main issues I have with the game however is 1) The melee combat and 2) the grabbing mechanics. The melee weapons themselves feel great and the throwing works very well; the problem I have is simply that the player hit-box is way too big for melee attacks. It feels like you can dodge completely out of the way of an attack and still get hit. Also sometimes the weapons that are thrown at you can get stuck on your hand and insta kill you which is very annoying.\n\nThe grabbing mechanics are what really put a bad taste in my mouth with this game. In the early stages everything works fine but once you get into the second half of the game where your inventory is full, it can be a nightmare. The reason is that the developers decided to implement a kind of force grab so you can grab things from a distance which is fine except for the fact that it is at a really awkward angle to even try to use it and they chose to prioritize the force grab even if your hand is right next to the thing you want to grab. This means that you can be trying to pick up something that your hand is literally touching but then end up just grabbing some 10 feet away because it was at just the right angle. This makes the end game really annoying because of all of the things you have do manage in your holsters. Still a great game and I would definitely recommend.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Ondre1234Jun 26 at 12:21 AM\nOne of the best games on quest\n\nTo be honest the game is the perfect mix between horror and action and a whole lot fun to play.

I've played a lot of VR and must say that I think this is one of the best and most immersive games I've played. I hope that this being a horror game doesnt put people off, the devs have done such a phenomenal job with this, from general design and how the story is portrayed to you, the player. The comic aesthetic is something to be adored and I hope more games take note from this, it's truly stunning. The gunplay and melee combat are both so satisfying, be it limb shooting/chopping or head popping/lopping, it all feels bloody fantastic (excuse the pun).\nMy only gripe with the game is that you can 't use your hands or the guns to knock back enemies so when you run out of ammo and have no melee weapons, you're quite the sitting target which I feel is the only thing breaking the immersion for me. I dont know about replayability yet but given the price, even if this game is a one play and done, it's beyond worth it!\nOh and did I mention that you're actually rewarded for your exploration! The lighter embers are great gameplay mechanic to show you the critical path, go the other routes first and find collectables and ammo etc, love it! Also the collectibles being interactive and lore driven, fantastic.\nA lot of care, love and passion has gone in to this game and it shows.

The combat feels a bit janky, especially without defense. Im also not the biggest fan of games that reset you back to the last checkpoint, where you can be two steps from the next section for an hour because the last piece is tough but it takes 15-20 minutes to get there. Its the only thing that breaks the immersion for me (and then this guy comes around a corner, find the sandwich, then ten paces for the next to spawn, like the last three times). Some great bits of gore, realism, and suspense: Its great that a headshot to undead isnt a guaranteed kill! Having a one armed stump flail at you is quite unnerving when you only have a hatchet... which can get stuck!

If you're not a great gamer or into horror, this is still for you! There's difficulty levels that make it super fun and customizable to your preferences. Definitely pick it up if you get the chance\n.\n.\nSome pros-\nIf you aren't a superfan of horror or having to memorize a reload pattern for your gun, you're just like me. I don't love jumpscares but when they come around I find them exhilarating. I enjoyed the Silent Hill franchise and I find this in that ball park. It's incredibly fun to kill enemies and wonder around complete environments. This game has lore, I haven't gotten through it all but it's only just launch day so I will soon. The gameplay seems like it could definitely last a while and it does have replayability for me as I will be going back to play the higher difficulty playthrough. The music adds to the already great atmosphere, definitely play with headphones if you have a pair. Some areas are scarier than others but it's always at least a little tense to add to the drama. The atmosphere is thrilling. You start memorizing things you didn't even realize you were memorizing like atmosphere changes and their meanings. THIS IS NOT A WAVE SHOOTER, it's a story! BUT you will get to shoot guns along with fun mechanics like shooting gas tanks for explosions. This has been my favorite game and overall experience on the quest.\n.\n.\nSome (not really) cons-\nThere aren't many for me if I'm honest. This however is for cons for me personally, these will be different for everyone. I wish I could carry more things (even though the limit does add to the challenge) Sometimes you'll see a black screen for a split second and I'm sure it's my fault but I'm not sure what I'm doing exactly . Lastly, I absolutely wish this game had some voice acting, it would be a whole different level with some voices! I don't know if this is possible as an update in the future but if it is, I think it would boost the game tremendously.\n\nHelpful | 8", "Ashrod01Apr 15 at 12:22 PM\nBEST VR GAME!\n\nThis game is terrifying, but at the same time it's also fun.

All I can do is think about playing it when Im not doing so... it is Challenging but possible for newbies, atmospheric, and very detailed. The stuff that you can do/HAVE TO DO in this game should be the new standard for VR.. it increases immersion.\n\nYou cannot just walk around with two weapons in your hands and like open doors and interact with objects/items while your weapon disappears. It is more realisticYou have to have a free hand to do so. So you have to either drop the weapon, put it in your side holster, OR YOU CAN DIG THE HATCHET (or whatever melee item you have) INTO WOOD OR SOIL for exampleso you can interact with the object and then pick your weapon back up!!! Like real life.. This is bad***!! It brings out the physicality that is required for immersive vr!\n\nI hope developers take note of this immersion and interactivity... I love Arizona sunshine but the extra steps that this team took with immersion in Lies Beneath makes me regret spending $40 or whatever on sunshine!\n\nSince the game is working with lower graphicsONLY due to the comic book style, it allows the quest to focus on other things like tracking and gameplay performance...\n\nThis game is a must own for horror fansits like SILENT HILL x EVIL DEAD x That actually cool looking game from that bad movie Stay Alive. For real it looks like a game somebody would play on VR in a movie where you think yeah right I wish VR was actually at that point now\n\nThat being said I wish they would patch some of the glitches that make you have to restart the game from a checkpoint. I encountered 3 glitches that made me restart... one was toward the beginning after a checkpoint you lose what weapon is in your hand. Another time that happened was I believe toward chapter 10 when you go through a dreamlike sequence... I also lost the weapon in my hand. Both times it was frustrating because I lost the only GUN I had so i wanted to go back to the checkpoint so I could have it. These problems honestly seem to be related to the adaptive controls (switching from holding button down to hold melee weapon to pressing button to toggle holding melee weapon).. another glitch was just during the part where you get the harpoon gun it disappeared and I had no way to get the dolls to burn and had to start at checkpoint! Please fix because they are a little game breaking but it is also understandable as it was with a weapon in each hand while switching between adaptive and toggle controls...\n\nHelpful | 0", "eoinokJun 6 at 11:17 PM\nThis is a bad game (updated)\n\nUpdate: If you read the novel below you'll see that I did not have a good time with this game. I haven't gone back to it since, so I can't say my impression of it has changed. But, to be fair, the odds are it's probably not that bad. Maybe I was just unlucky. It's got tons of positive reviews, so there must be something to it. I've added some stars but I'll leave the original review as well, because perhaps it will provide succor to the next poor soul who has an experience like mine.\n\nOriginal review:\nOK, apologies in advance: this is going to be a long one. Will anyone read this? Who knows.\n\nThis game is getting glowing, fawning, exulting reviews. It is a bad game.\n\nGood things: nice graphics, interesting story, good holstering and reload system. I don't doubt that a lot of love and hard work went into this.\n\nSo why is it bad? In short, much of the game is a cheat. It's more like an interactive narrative than a game. It puts you in situations where you have to fight for your life but in reality you have far less control over the outcome than you think. For example, in Chapter 4 there's a big horde battle in which countless waves of monsters attack you over and over and over again. I could write a novel about everything that's awkard and unpleasant about this scene in practice but suffice it to say that it's basically a cheap death event - a moment designers put in a game knowing that a first time player has no real chance of surviving. OK, this happens in games. The thing is though, when you die the checkpoint system doesn't put you back at the start of the fight. It reloads you mid onslaught. So, if you were screwed before you're probably still screwed. I retried this I don't know how many times. Let me tell you: there is no good way to win, no strategy, no skill involved. It's all luck. It's mostly RNG stuff. If you try to stock up on ammo the game will *instantly* tell you can't carry anymore. If you try to use your ammo the game will *instantly* tell you you're out of bullets. If you think \"OK then I'll use my ax\" the game will decide you're too weak to grip an ax handle and your character will simply let it go. This battle is so cramped, awkward and annoying that any semblance of strategy or skill evaporates after 2 seconds. It's so badly designed that you literally have to eat a sandwich while demons are actively mauling you to survive. The really, truly irritating thing though is this: it's not a real fight. It's a scripted sequence. It turns out that after you've gone through the cycle of instantly-full-and-instantly-depleted ammo for about 86 waves and eaten 42 sandwiches while 967 demons absorbed infinite ax blows, yet more demons swarm in by breaking down the doors. And, it turns out, if you run through the right door at that point the scripted sequence ends and the demons just aren't there anymore. To be clear, there is nothing in the game telling the player to abandon the protection and supllies of the cabin. I just randomly stumbled upon this script-changing moment after wasting way too much time on this bad game.\n\nI slogged on. I got to Chapter 7. It looked like another big fight/scripted moment was about to happen. Now I'm thinking \"At least if I die here I'll go back to the start of this chapter\". I died. The game sent me back to Chapter 5. I'm not kidding. Now in this boss fight in Chapter 7, at first you think you need to do a particular thing that the game taught you to do earlier in this kind of situation. But it turns you can't. Again, the player has no control. So while I was working back to Chapter 7 after dying I thought \"OK I'll give this game one more chance. I'll do the survival game thing and save as many bullets as I can. I'll melee every monster till I get to the boss fight in Chapter 7 so I can hit him with everything I have. So I get to Chapter 7 ready to give this boss hell. Turns out that, again, this is not a fight but a scripted moment. At least, it seems that way because all of my ammo did nothing to even stagger this boss.\n\nSpeaking of ammo, the player character's extremely limited ability to carry bullets (doesn't she have pockets???) is another example of how the player has no choice or power in this game. You can't choose to build up a good store of ammo and supplies over time. The designers want you to have X supplies at X time. If you try to build up more the game just says no you're not allowed to.\n\nIn VR, lots of games make you accidentally punch your wall. This is the only game that has ever made me *want* to punch a wall.\n\nHelpful | 3", "fifteenplagueMay 6 at 11:41 PM\nFinally a full length vr game\n\nFor the longest time I've waited for a decent sized game on the oculus that takes longer then 30 minutes, this beast of game has excellent graphics combat, realistic melee and thrilling gunplay, if you want to feel powerful, yet weak at the same time I reccomend this game, it truly lives up to its price tag\n\nHelpful | 1", "tjrossinApr 2 at 11:53 AM\nA new benchmark for the Quest\n\nHighly stylised thematic game.

Cool variety of weapons and scarcity of ammo makes you have to be careful. There's lots of fighting, but it is not a shoot em up where all you're doing is fighting endless hordes. Occasionally it is scary (in a good way), often it is creepy too. But it is far from being just a horror title. I'm in chapter 5 and so for most of the game has been outdoors with fog so you can't see an expansive world at all times, but I think that allows the gameplay to be very smooth because it doesn't have to juggle millions of bits of graphics.

Very often the weapons will simply go right through the ennemies with no impact, resulting in a very messy catfight of frantically swinging an axe or club like a baby rattle rather than giving commited strikes since these dont work. Another thing I dont get is why we can punch in the tutorial but cannot do it in-game, I understand that this Might be done to avoid anyone going Mortal Kombat on the monsters, but If we could push or punch the creatures without doing any damage to them, basically just stunning them, I feel like this would give the world an even more real feel. These are my only complaints, I feel like we should feel hopeless when the ghouls come very close of course, but when you die because of a glitchy weapon or not being able to use a very instinctive move, it is frustrating ! If the developers could patch this, it would be my favorite game on the Quest !\n\n\nBut like I said earlier, this is a fantastic game that you absolutely need to try !

It is a shame that it is completely ruined by gameplay choices. I'll try to explain because there is really a lot that represent a complete turn off for me. Let's begin with simple stuff : equipment management. It is a pain. You have only 2 slots that you have to manage to put everything you need. And I could have been okay with that. It seems like Half life Alyx style, right? Absolutely not! Because those 2 slots are occupied by your weapons too. You have to choose to bring with you a sandwich to heal or a gun. A gun or an axe. Most of the monsters are unstoppable death machines and bullet sponges that runs towards you to beat you to death, and most of the time they spawn so close to you that you don't actually have the time to kill them before they reach you and hurt you. So you need a source of healing and a lot of fire power in this game to go through. You would say : well okay you have 2 slots, one for a gun one for the food, you are okay. No I'm not. I only briefly mentioned the melee weapons. Those are completely useless in combat (because as I said the enemies are unstoppable death machines careless about an axe hit on the head, so they reach you and beat you no matter what, if you go melee), but you need to bring one with you to break wood obstacles, and to break crates where you can find ammo and food. So the math is simple : to proceed in the game we absolutely need 3 things (a gun, some food and a melee weapon) but we have only 2 slots to manage all of that. Great! At this point you could say : \"you can always have your weapons in hand and put something else inside the 2 slots.\" That would be in perfect Alyx style and would be great. But it doesn't work like that. If you want to take something from a slot you need to drop your weapon on the floor. And if you are in the middle of a fight you can't even think about dropping a weapon to take your sandwich to heal yourself, because that weapon will always drop inside the floor pixels, or fly miles away from you for no reason. Or if you are lucky enough that it drops on the floor near you, good luck on take it up from there. While 2 or 3 foes are surrounding you, you have to struggle with the \"not so precise\" items grabbing behavior. And what about if I want to grab a two handed weapon from my back? I have to drop on the floor both my gun and my melee if my hips slots are full. And what about collectibles composed by multiple parts? You have to hold those in your hands bringing them with you looking for other parts... This items management system just doesn't work. But all of these things I mentioned are not the worst part. The worst, obnoxious, degenerate, toxic thing of all : the cursed dolls section. Oh boy. In the middle of those \"dreams\" sessions you have to run around the map looking for those floating dolls, while a never-ending wave of enemies spawns from everywhere around you. And while you are there, in front of a doll, surrounded by monsters.... You have to drop both your weapons, grab the doll with one hand, take the lighter with the other and burn the doll. Than grab your weapons from the floor, kill everyone around you and go chase the next doll... Absurd... Another thing that I can't understand is monsters respawn. It completely shuts down every form of exploration of the map. Because there is no reason to go searching for ammo or food if when I come back I have to consume what I just found, killing respawned monsters. It has just no sense in my opinion. About the weapons. There is a great variety of weapons. But unfortunately most of those are useless or have a weird concept behind them. Traps and gas cans are fun, so are the throwing knifes or spikes, but this game is not made for single use weapons (due to the awful slot management system we already talked about) so I've never used those. As we already stated melee weapons are useless in combat, but needed for other stuff in the game, and that makes them even more annoying... So what remains are the guns, the shotgun and the harpoon. The guns are cool and handy. Love those. The shotgun ammo management is a mistery to me. For every other weapon you can store more ammo than what the magazine can handle and reload the weapon when needed. Not the shotgun. You can just have those 6 bullets. Why? And than there is the harpoon. Oh boy I loved it. That is really brilliant. You can use it for open hidden paths, to reach dolls from distance, to grab hooks away from you... but you can't use it as a weapon... What a shame... It just stuns the enemy, it doesn't kill him. Why?... there is no point to stun the enemy if I have to waste time to put the harpoon behind my back and take another weapon to kill him. Anyway... Well this was a hell of a long message but I wrote it because I really think that this game could shine in incredible ways. The graphic is phenomenal, the atmosphere is great, the world is intriguing and well designed, the story is simple but cool. I just can't stand these gameplay choices. And for me the gameplay is the most important thing of all, that's why I had to give the game 1 star. I'm sorry. Of course all of my complaints comes from my personal taste and I can understand if the game works great for others.\n\nHelpful | 30", "SnowUseApr 30 at 12:52 PM\nCROSS BUY!!\n\nThis is the best game I've played on the Quest in a long time.

It took me over 6 hours to get through all 20 chapters on the easiest difficulty, and I still missed some lore objects so its not even 100% completed yet. Visuals are beautifully creative & incredibly immersive. Intense music along with creepy sound effects blend paranoia & panic, peaking my adrenaline with every surprising moment. As I progressed through levels, the environments changed regularly providing refreshingly different stigmas for each atmosphere. The story is mysterious, entertaining, & addictive.

Not too scary although there were some creepy moments and maybe 1 or 2 jump scares. The gameplay was excellent and i loved the different weapons on how they felt. There was a real feel of holding the bladed weapons and the guns all felt great.\n\nI can't really fault the game without being extra critical. It really is a top class game and put others to shame with the quantity and quality of gameplay. The graphics show what can be done with the hardware, not going overboard on trying to be super realistic. Changing weapons in game was a challenge, i think i will try hard mode next.

Long and short of it is stop reading this, and go do yourself a favor by buying this game. The game isnt perfect, sometimes grabbing for your inventory is tricky and you end up grabbing something else. Stuff can bug out in the game yada yada yada, but when you see the enemies, combo your different weapons just right in order to barely make it out alive with 1% health is amazing on its own. On top of the combat, and lore this is a freakin horror game. There are segments where I completely forget Im in vr after playing so long so I peak around corners, and even open my mouth to eat the food. The monsters leave me terrified, parts where I just wanna do a complete 180 to get out of dodge, amazing boss fights, and challenging game play. Ive died at least 20 times throughout the 20 chapters of the game. I very much enjoyed it, and will probably play it again on the harder difficulty because its just that good.\n\nHelpful | 0", "UpstreamLotus0May 14 at 8:56 PM\nAlmost perfect\n\nThis game is one of the best be shooters for the quest right now. The way the guns work and the feeling they provide make just shooting them feel great, the mechanics of the weapons feel on the tear of Pavlov. And the melee weapons are very well, as they can be stabbed and sliced into enemies and they can be thrown at walls to stick in place. I played through the game on normal all the way until the 19 section (spoilers ahead) where you have to gather all the doll pieces and put them together, but there being no saves in that level hardly, meaning I had to restart the process all over again, and I would have to kill the most annoying enemies all over.

First vr game thats ever made me yelp, and the first one to keep me invested till the very end to the point i was begging for more. The combat is spot on making me feel the satisfaction when i hit an enemy with a well placed axe or cleaver throw, the gunplay was amazing as i felt like a badss pumping a shotgun and shooting a pigmans head off or firing a 1851 colt navy revolver from the hip like a western monster hunter. Some of the areas were a bit winding and i got lost in them at some points but dmn were they beautiful.

The enemies really bring terror to your soul, locations are varied and have great sound design behind it and even interface brought smartly to the game, like with health, that is shown with blood on your hands and with lighter, that shows you hints.\nBUT. I cant say, that its really great at the end. There is some really broken mechanics.\n\nFor example, there is really not enough place in your inventory which should force you to choose between weapons and food, for example, but in truth it just makes you choose the wrong gun and not having the right ammo till the end of the chapter, or not having food, when its really needed, and die frustrated. Melee combat is quite questionable too. Instead of some blocking mechanic you just have to dodge enemys attacks, by moving away, which feels janky and not intuitive for me.\nThere is really little place for ammo which makes it very confusing, when you find twice the amount you need, or twice less, then you need.\nThe last issue, while being the most engaging from the storys perspective is has really overpowered enemies from gameplays perspective, which makes it really frustrating too.\n\nAt the end, i cant say, that i recommend Lies Beneath. Its gameplay feels confusing and frustrating, but its design, atmosphere and graphics almost brilliant. I can say, that you should try it, if you are interested in a event horror for the Quest, but otherwise its not really worth your time and money.\n\nP.S.

With that being said, everyone has already sent out their love and appreciation for this game, as I shall do by compiling hours into it. So far, however, I've encountered some immersion breaking moments in this game that I can't look past\n-Bullets will not register upon contact with enemies at a certain distance. Not an issue with being too far, but if an enemy is inches away from the gun, the bullets will not hit. You have to stay at a certain distance to deal damage, which is especially frustrating when you have to fight the masses in the cabin scene where you first get the shotgun.\n- Not something you can exactly fix in a patch, and it's more nitpicking if anything, but ragdoll. In the VERY beginning, in the empty tutorial room where the faceless zombie is standing, you get to punch away and feel the responsiveness of that. That is never used in the game. You can't punch or shove enemies away, even to stagger them. I've tried many times just to see and your hands just phase through\n-Finally, staggering in general. I love guns and all, but using the melee weapons in a game such as this where you can stick knives and wooden shards into the enemies, THIS brings the immersion. But when I stab an enemy somewhere like the chest, the vast majority of the time they don't even stagger, they just rush forward right after. The biggest problem with this is that you don't get to combo the stab/melee or react, because even when you back up the enemy will float forward the extra distance needed in the animation to hit you.\n\nNow I know the only real bug listed is the first thing, and the other two are just me being picky; aside from all that however, this game has showed the groundbreaking talents of everyone who has worked on it, and what they can do with this relatively new technology. From the very moment this game showed up on the coming soon page, I've done all my research (although there was very little coverage) on it, and everyday I kept checking the page until there was finally a settled release date.

The guns feel great. The EC Comics-inspired visuals look great and are a very smart way of working around the Quest's visual limitations. The developers were clearly inspired by Resident Evil 4 (the cabin chapter especially), which is a pretty good template to work from.\n\nThe negatives - the game is extremely linear and could benefit from more exploration, as it gets repetitive pretty quickly. The melee combat feels janky and never clicked for me. The draw distance often feels too short and I'm left staring at a blue void. Also, I realize the devs were likely constrained by budget, but a voice over for the text narration would've done wonders to make me more invested in the plot.\n\nLies Beneath is a little rough around the edges but I'm still very much enjoying my time with it.

Ive hesitated to buy this game first because of the price tag but second because i thought i was not going to be able to handle the horror. But I bought it and Ive only played like 15% and this game pushes the limits of what the oculus quest can do. I just finished playing Red Matter, that is too brilliant, and this game competes right up with red matter so props to you devs!, anyway the horror is perfect enough for me to enjoy a spill chill and a light childish scream and frantically fight for my life which is so much fun and what I live for. My only issue is when i use the axe or sword to frantically slash for my life nothing really happens? Maybe its just me not doing anything right since its my first time but just thought i would let you guys know. Also sometimes when you pause the game and go back in , it disorients you from the position you originally paused in and i get flustered and scared while i hear growls as demons run at me, doesnt take away from the game or anything, but i love what you guys have done to push the boundaries of the quest further with great mechanics, graphics, and horror with good action. If you are debating this game because of the price tag, buy it, you already know you wasted money buying the crappy 7 dollar games, invest in this game for spine chilling horror with great action or, Red Matter for great puzzles and stories, but i already recommend Lies Beneath over Red Matter.

Honestly I've beaten the game twice now and I still don't think I understood what happened but whatever. I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great and creepy and much like the orihinal Silent Hill uses the limited hardware of the Quest to add ambience that works great for this title. There is a good variety of weapons, enemies, and areas. The UI is intuitive and the physics work great. The gameplay is fun and engaging and theres a good blend of both isolation thats appropriate for the horror vibe and enough freedom that it doesn't feel hand holdy. There are enough suprises, unlockables and a good sense of progression that even on multiple playthroughs I still feel a sense of discovery on my 3rd time. Its definetly not for the feint of heart or the weak of stomach. Its comfortable for a VR vet but I probably wouldnt recommend if youre prone to motion sickness but I love this. I want more of this.

At this moment, there is nothing similar to this in Oculus Quest. It achieves a good balance between action and horror/creepy atmosphere. In that sense, it remembers me to Dead Space (an action game with a creepy horror atmosphere that keeps up the tension).\nHighlights:\n- Excelent creepy atmosphere.\n- Good graphics (with a stylish comic tone).\n- Excelent sound and music.\n- Long singleplayer campaign: about 8 hours. Not very common in Oculus Quest.\n- Great variety of enemies\n- Intriguing plot\n- Good physics: semi-realistic reloading for guns and shotgun, melee weapons can actually hit the environment, axes can be wielded with one or two hands, knives can be wielded straight or reverse...\n\nThings that can be improved:\n- Close range melee combat: While sometimes it can be entertaining (mainly when the weapon gets stuck in the enemy or a limb is severed) most of the time it feels weird to swing axe fast in any direction.\n\n\n****** POTENTIAL SPOILERS *******\n\n\nAlso, I have found some bugs, or at least I think that they are bugs:\n- Enemies weak spots: When you use the lighter and a gun to shoot at the enemy weak spots, there are certain enemies for whom it doesn't work properly. Most of these enemies are the ones near the end of the game (the ones with tentacles in the upper body), and when the weak spot is located in the legs. When the weak spot is on the arms, I can remove them, but when it is located on the legs, I end spending a lot of bullets as I was shooting on any other part of the body and dying a lot. I'm not sure if this is intentional (so I didn't find the good strategy) or if this is a bug.\n- Enemies respawning: When you complete an objective in a chapter (for example burning a doll) and you do backtracking (i.e. go back to explore a previous zone of the level) enemies that have been killed respawn again.

Worth the $30.\n\nHelpful | 0", "teamNONINApr 9 at 8:22 PM\nLike it a lot, hate it a little.\n\nFirst off, I do like this game. But with some adjustments, I would love this game. It could be great. The atmosphere is foreboding, and the comic book aesthetic works great in the headset. Kind of reminds me of Borderlands 2 vr, where I noticed a big bump in fidelity of the graphics, that I wasn't expecting. Everything speaks to me for this game as a fan of Tales from the Crypt. It's not gut punch scary, it's definitely more along the Crypt, where it's creepy, but also has a dark sense of humor, but it won't likely give you nightmares. == the bad is managing your inventory. Is it just me, or is the stand-off at the cabin, insanely difficult? You get 2 holsters on your hip and 2 by your shoulders. If you hold the Hold Button and let go, the weapon drops. But if you tap the Hold Button, I it will keep in your grip. This becomes a problem when becoming overwhelmed by enemies, because switching weapons fast could mean you tapped the Grip Button, but maybe tapped a little too long, and that means your weapon will drop, and you will think its in your hand. You cant grab a weapon without holstering, instead of just swapping weapons, and in the heat of battle swapping a gun for an axe, or another gun that has ammo, mistakes can easily be made, and those mistakes leave you without a gun or melee, and once that happens, there is no way to attack or defend. Not to mention you cant really use your shoulder holsters because it is reserved for the shotgun and another weapon that doesnt turn up until half way through the game, and has very limited applications. Before it shows up, is just an empty holster. So this means that with all the melee weapons, and the several guns, you have to choose wisely because you can only place them in your hip holsters. You cant use 2 guns because if you run out of ammo, you have no defensive or offensive abilities, so you need a melee weapon. It would be nice to be able to choose which weapons go on your shoulders. Even if it was just the long melee weapons weapons But it's is really easy to drop them in battle without you realizing it. Other VR games will have your weapon return to your holster. I can't tell you how many times I ran out of bullets and realized I didnt have my axe at my side. This becomes mind numbing when you are dealing with a wave assault. When you have so many monsters coming at you from all sides, it's easy to get lost in the moment, and the moment you run out of bullets, that lengthy time of swapping weapons will usually be your demise. When you have a shotgun, you have to load in each shell individually, and you can't really swap to a melee weapon, because you need to pump the shotgun, and it can only ever carry 6 rounds. It would also be nice to block attacks with the shotgun if you need to reload. If you drop the gun, or melee weapon , you're done. because, as I said earlier, there is no way to block incoming attacks. When you look down to your empty holsters during a horde, it's comparable to holding a grenade and noticing you accidentally pulled the pin. it feels like the combat becomes unintuitive, especially with tracking issues here and there, swapping guns, loading them, and holstering becomes way to cumbersome. With that said, I do like reloading weapons because it adds to the immersion but switching weapons is terrible. --- on that note, I hate the cabin standoff with all of my heart. -- but this game is still worth getting.\n\nHelpful | 9", "VirtualWaypoint16 days ago\nCreepy and welcomed breath og fresh air\n\nSo there's plenty of shooters out there some more generic than others. I think Lies Beneath with its melee combat and ok variety in guns will satisfy any VR FPS fan out there. I was first hesitant to buy this because I'm not a horror fan. This game is scary but its more like resident evil scary than a jump at you kind of horror game. I havent played through the game yet but I've flinched several times already. But you're always well enough equipped to defend yourself from all the creepy guys scattered around.\n\nI love the art style of the game, it looks sharp and the cel shaded guns and lighter looks sooo good and is a great contrast from the muddy grey enviroments.\n\nSoundesign is great, and the enemies give their position away by grunting and making noise its both creepy but also a good way to prepare yourself for \"battle\"\n\nWeapon handling is almost as expected, reloading is different, but good. Magazines never fall out of the gun, instead you pop them out half way to inspect your ammo count push it back in. You can also rack the gun, and shotgun infinite number og times without loosing shells or bullets. I thinks its cool to have the option. You can also toss the gun to your other and or do a hot swap with the melee weapon. This game is very ambidextrious friendly. Placement of weapons is very well thought out. Big guns on shoulders, smaller at the hip.\n\nOnly 4 stars though:\n\n- The fog, not sure if its an effect or just a way to make it more creepy but sometimes i feel like the enviroments are too foggy.I guess to save on performance.\n\n- I know there's only a campaign here, would love some DLC or a different mode. To keep med coming back when I've finished it.\n\n\n- Story is a bit meh? You read the story and progress by looking at comic captions in the level and turning pages in a comicbook. A different way of storytelling but i would have preffered some narration/voiceacting aswell.\n\nShould you get it?\nYes, but bare in mind that it will spook you a couple of times.

All of the characters are mysterious the story is fun to uncover the secrets arent hidden to the point that its tiring to look for them but they also arent in plain sight. This game has very strong silent hill vibes but it feels completely original unlike games that copy other ones this one was inspired and honestly its amazing. If you really are a fan of horror games you need to play lies beneath, and even if you arent a fan of horror the game is still very enjoyable as a action/survival game. Also the game is large which is nice because there are a lot of quest games that seem to be short, but this game is long and filled with entertainment all throughout it took me maybe 3-5 hours to beat the game and that was without taking and significant breaks other than to eat and take the headset off for a moment.

The atmosphere is perfect for what it is trying to achieve: unnerving and a slight overwhelming feeling at times. This is just as much of an action game as it is a horror game, so if fighting off whatever is chasing you puts you off, then this game isnt for you. Id put it in line with games such as Resident Evil where you get chills down your spine while also being able to fight back and take control of a situation before it gets out of hand.\n\nAll that being said, there are definitely some game breaking bugs that feel like could be polished in a future update. Occasionally pausing the game would not show the menu screen. Other times taking the headset off for a second would completely crash the game. This led to a few frustrating moments where I found myself replaying the same chapter because I had to take the headset off for a minute before continuing.\n\nThere are also occasional difficulty spikes that seem out of place? Maybe I just need to git gud but there were some parts (specifically in the school) that I needed to turn the difficulty down a notch to get past.\n\nOverall though, these are all things that can be fixed and the gameplay is definitely on the higher end of spectrum for most Quest games, and a variety of enemies and environments definitely keeps you on your toes. There were some parts that genuinely made me uncomfortable when having to walk around in the dark with only the dim brightness of my lighter to guide me.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent unsettling atmosphere\n- Gameplay is solid\n- Enemies and environments are beautiful\n- Comic book aesthetic comes across very nice\n- Weapons feel good to use\n\nCons:\n- Several game breaking bugs\n- Random difficulty spikes\n- Occasionally would render slowly\n\nWould definitely recommend to most Quest owners.

The game runs well for the most part.\n\nThere are spots where the game flickers, as if going between 2 sections of the game. Being forced to run through narrow paths with no way to cut the spikes, causing you to lose health, is kind of dumb...let me cut the spikes with my axe. There are spots where the lighter does not work properly and points to nothing...for instance in that first castle thing...the lighter embers were pointing towards a spot next to the fire and nothing was there...I had to go down the hallway while the lighter was showing this to be the wrong way.\n\nIts not a bad game, its not a fantastic game either like current reviews are making it out to be.\n\nHelpful | 8", "LordSkelApr 19 at 4:59 PM\nAbsolutely amazing! Until...\n\nI was hooked on this game the moment I started playing. Seeing the Tails from the Crypt style comic book at the start of the game and immediately getting thrown into a very thematic and terrifying wooded area dripping with impending doom and cult vibes... I knew I was in for an amazing game.\n\nHowever, as I began the second to last level of the game, it suddenly became a frustrating grind through areas with glitched walls/ doors that enemies can throw objects through. Not to mention how scarce the checkpoints became, Id spend half an hour making progress not seeing a single checkpoint just to die to an enemy and be sent ALL the way to the checkpoint I left HALF AN HOUR AGO. Currently I am stuck on a checkpoint where you have to gather pieces to a doll. The enemy spawns are dense and dont register hits on limbs. Creatures can throw objects through walls. And just to top it off.. even after you fully assemble the doll... NO. CHECKPOINT. Just more enemies that swarm you immediately with one goal in mind... to send you back to the checkpoint BEFORE you even knew to assemble a doll! I understand Im getting close to the end of the game and its supposed to be tough, but this is OBSURD. The game had been lush with checkpoints that made sense.\n\nAfter a long and tense walk through an area.\nCheckpoint.\n\nAfter a tough but balanced fight with some enemies.\nCheckpoint.\n\nAfter solving a puzzle.\nCheckpoint.\n\nThen you have this level:\nFind doll pieces.\nFight enemies\nFind more doll pieces.\nFight more enemies that can hit you from around corners and through walls.\nAssemble more of the doll with barely any health left and ammo sparse.\nFinally assemble the doll just to have it float away and immediately get flanked by swarms of lunging enemies that hit me even if they are facing the wrong direction.\nOh yeah... still no checkpoint.\nDead.\nRepeat.\n\n\nI want to give this game 5 stars SOOOO bad... but I just cant right now. Even if I beat this level, Im not sure if I even want to play the final one for fear of how little checkpoints and frustration it might cause me.\n\nHelpful | 5", "taylor.huynh2Apr 3 at 6:39 PM\nBEST GAME EVER!!!\n\nJUST STARTED PLAYING THIS.

Dont enjoy horror movies or games because 90% of the time you can kinda figure out when something is going to happen and it breaks you away from the experience.

Lies Beneath uses simplistic graphics and mechanics to deceive the player into a false sense of comfort, and then it starts scaring you more and more relentlessly.

However the game is long with a total of 20 chapters I think and each chapter can take a good while to complete, so the price is right imo. It is a hard and creepy game with amazing visuals which make it unique. The storyline was engaging with its comic-like theme and its difficulty makes it somewhat satisfying when completing certain parts. Only downside I have is , the game is long enough but I wish there was something to do after completing the game, I want to keep playing it but I cant bring myself to do the campaign again, maybe some free dlc content would come in handy.\n\nHelpful | 1", "Lucid_Dreamer21Jul 4 at 12:31 AM\nBEST GAME IN THE QUEST\n\nI recently just purchased the Quest because of all the commotion that was being stirred up about VIRTUAL REALITY a few games I played were okay but I wanted something that really grabbed my attention...WELLLLLLL THIS IS THE GAME.

SPOILER FREE\n\nI have played the game on normal difficulty, so your experience may vary.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThe comic artstyle is executed amazingly, with beautiful (and horrifying) enviroments, vastly different from each other, from snowy forests to a boat cementery. The guns feel great to shoot and the melee is incredible from throwing knives to lodging a pickaxe in an enemys head. The story is simple, yet it is surprisingly deep with a lot of care given to it. The lore pickups not only give you more story, but they unlock ammo and weapons at checkpoints which is a really smart way to encourage world exploration. Explorating every nook and cranny of the world is a treat. The sound design is one of the best Ive had in a VR game. There is 1 mini boss and 2 bosses which are all designed really well and feel fair.\n\nTHE BAD:\nOnly 2 inventory slots, not counting the two back slots as those are reserved for a specific weapon and tool. This makes the game really frustrating at times, especially at the end chapters, as you need minimum 2 guns (melee is pretty much useless at this point of the game) and as much healing items as you can get. Melee is only good for stealth early-game and breaking planks and boxes, most of the time you hit an enemy, theyll probably hit you back twice as hard, as there is no way to block, only dodge, which is a shame as the melee feels great. Chapter 19 is full of enemies which 2 shot you and tank your bullets, and some are glitched which make it impossible to blow up their legs to 3 shot them, so they just use their ability (unless its a feature in which case please remove it). If you die in chapter 19 you go back to the beginning, except for a checkpoint near the end. I havent even played the game on hard mode and I dont think I want to.\n\nOverall the game is great, but it really, really needs some balancing in the end chapters.\n\nHelpful | 0", "NeoVangelionApr 28 at 9:54 AM\nSuspense Horror Action done well.\n\nClever use of weather and lighting with a polished comic book style.

It sets up an unfair standard that the game was never trying to reach in the first place.......now on to my review\n\n\nIs it worth 30$? Possibly, but right now I'm saying \"not really\".\n\nThe graphics are on the bad side of \"ok\", but the atmosphere is actually pretty good. Sort of a sin city meets resident evil vibe\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly basic. Instead of iron sights the revolver has a laser pointer, the axe was pretty fun but not the best I've seen, and I haven't unlocked any other weapons\n\nIt's very hand holdy, it sort of feels like babies first VR horror game. It's like it really wants to be half life or resident evil, but doesn't have any faith in the player to figure things out for themselves.......to be fair I'm still in the first parts of the game, so that could change\n\nThere have been multiple points where I was supposed to be scared and just wasn't, and I'm very susceptible to horror, I actually think My niece could handle this game and she was afraid of the mouse in Moss lol\n\nThere's definitely potential in the story, I'm intrigued for sure and will definitely keep playing, and whether or not it's worth 30$ relies ENTIRELY on the story, because the graphics/gameplay/horror elements definitely aren't, even for the quest\n\nHelpful | 6", "stockXuser123Apr 13 at 12:24 PM\nFavorite quest game so far\n\nI wish I could rate this more than 5 stars because Ive never really been a horror person but playing this game has made me love it.

The art style is awesome and works well with the abilities of the quest. It gives an old horror comic book vibe that makes it unique in the horror genre. The creepy feeling can't be denied as you're going along in the different environments hoping to make it to the next save point without getting caught by the monsters that lurk in this place. I intended to give it about half hour after it finished downloading you know...to feel it out. Two hours later (would've been longer if my quest didn't crash for some reason) i realized that this game would have to be in heavy rotation! I don't know how close to finishing i am but i hope there a lot more game left to go. I'm giving 4 stars for now because i can't judge the fullness of the story yet but everything points to this being a 5 star game to me! The feel of swinging the axe and other sharp handheld weapons is satisfying. They seem to get stuck in wood planks or whatever you chop with them and they can be left in the monsters too if you're not careful. You can almost feel the chops! If you know vr games, you know that even some of the really popular titles miss the mark there. The gun is good too and using the lighter with it is a good way to add to it's usefulness and accuracy which is important because ammo is limited. This is a great game and i highly recommend it!

I'm gonna avoid posting any spoilers to the game so you'll be safe when you watch my vids lol. I'm sure that once i finish this game, I'll be able to give that 5th star!

This is certainly no run of the mill vr experience. This is brand new, and takes the oculus quest to it's limits.\n\nThis game is gonna be remembered with the other survival horror greats, RE, dead space series, and other classics.\n\nAnd yes this is indeed survival horror. I didn't expect mich going into this game, and it far exceeded my expectations. This game makes you micromanage your inventory, ammo, health, all while scaring the absolute sh** out of you.\n\nThe only reason i didnt give the game 5 out of 5 stars is because of a few bugs, which is certainly to be expected from a game that is so new. The most abnoting of them being the game black-screening randomly. I believe it's meant to do that when you come too close to obstacle and in-game structures. But it feels like it does that even when i am 5-6 ft away. This can be annoying and can mean a game over if you're in the middle of a right.\n\nThe second bug I came across was slightly less annoying but still troublesome nonetheless. Whenever you pause the game and unpause, you will start facing a different direction than when you started. Even if you remain standing the same direction. You also lose tracking briefly when this happens, the pause menu screen may be 10 ft. Away from you when you pause and you have to re-center.\n\nSo all-in-all this game is NEARLY flawless, as long as the devs fix these bugs, it WILL be flawless.

Combat was fun. Atmosphere was creepy unique and fun. But I bought this game because other reviews had indicated that it was a long game and that it had a great story. This game was not as long as other reviews would indicate.. I beat it and about two charges of my headset. I guess it's about as long as I would have expected for the price. However my biggest complaint is the story.. Everyone raved about the story to this game.. it's hard to voice my complaint without spoilers. So I'll just say the story did nothing to explain the situation at all.. it just didn't make any sense why you had to fight all these monsters.. it didn't explain why the monsters exist or what the significance is of the lighter.. it drops enough hits that by chapter 10 you get a general idea Of how the story is going to unfold. In the end instead of a sense of satisfaction that most games give you you get an overwhelming sense of frustration.. your left thinking what that was it seriously? And if you plan on buying ( and in all honesty it is a fun game so you should give it a try) this game stop reading now because the last sentence or two will be a spoiler. SPOILER ALERT ****** while losing someone close to you can be very depressing and cause some deep rooted psychological problems in some people it doesn't create hallucinations of monsters on this level.

It surpassed every expectation I had.\n\nHelpful | 0", "omeggsApr 2 at 7:38 PM\nGod, yes. Just, buy it.\n\nI normally dont write reviews for games, but this one just absolutely deserved it. This game has blown me AWAY from playing it. The comic book art style is absolutely stunning and works perfectly with these creepy monsters you have to fight off. You can choose to shoot your way through this hellish nightmare or swing at demons with a variety of melee weapons, which is my personal favorite. Not only is it satisfying to hack off the limbs of these creatures, but a quick shotgun blow also gets the job done.\nAn absolute must have for any survival horror fan. The way your weapons and hands interact with the world around you only adds to the realism, and the story is more than long enough to get you replaying.\nOnly giving it 4 stars because Ive noticed a FEW bugs; When knife throwing enemies throw a knife at you, sometimes the knife will get stuck on you and youll take a hit from it about 5 or 6 times before the knife hits the ground. Also, the grabbing is a finicky. Alas, this game has just come out, and it really doesnt take away from how incredible this experience is. Highly recommend! :)\n\nHelpful | 0", "SPENGAApr 2 at 7:21 PM\nIts a good game\n\nI dont get scared much. But when you seeing it run torwards you.

But theres still some issues.\n1. The biggest one is the Force Grab. The only way you can grab certain objects is by waiting until you look at it just right and have your hand just right so it can fling to you. This was very annoying when an object is within actual grabbing distance but I couldnt just... Grab it... then objects that you want to force grab.., like a particular doll thats relevant in the game, you cant.\n2. You cant melee with guns. Sometimes I ran out of ami with my shotgun or pistol and I wish I could have done a last minute bash or throw with the weapon. Would be great if you could find bayonets or just blunt force with your fists, etc.\n3. Some things I still dont understand like the skulls in the chapter select. It will say 3/4 etc. but I have no idea what its referencing.\n4. I wish there was a mode to play multiplayer or just be in an end ness horde mode to just kill things as long as possible\n5. I wish there was some puzzles along the way.\n\n\nBut those issues are very minor in the grand scheme of the game. Overall the comic book style was great, the story Sooners wss creepy, etc! The difficulty settings felt like they really did make a difference. You could be clever with things like bear traps and gas cans, or just run and shoot. I wish there was some voiceover or at least the option for it instead if having to read everything but again, minor gripe. Overall it was a good length game and I had a blast and I plan to keep playing in a harder difficulty!\n\nHelpful | 0", "Fredd32Apr 12 at 9:19 AM\nVery good\n\nGood balance between horror and action.

Although the graphical fidelity of the environments are not the greatest, the animations, sounds and models are of good enough quality to really create a tense atmosphere.\n\nTogether with the sometimes hectic action scenes, it creates one hell of a Standalone survival horror title.\n\nHelpful | 0", "UBSERDApr 8 at 3:04 PM\nI really love this game.... but\n\nIn a good portions of this game when the action picks up, the game becomes a chugfest with uneven frames that are disorienting. The sad thing is for the most part when walking around the environment things are much smoother and you wish the whole game ran like that. When there are multiple enemies on screen, or a scripted event happens things take a turn for the worst. Small encounters dont cause much performance drop but the uneven frames exist there as well but on a smaller scale.\n\nOkay that was a bunch of issues I have with this game, but other than those, this game is great and is definitely a tense challenge. The ability to swing weapons around and throw them at enemies including axes and stakes is pretty darn cool. You can also flip the weapons in the air really fast and catch them again and depending on when you catch them they will be facing a different direction which I thought was pretty awesome. The shotgun is awesome as well!! The racking and sound effects while doing it are spot on!\n\nTo add to what I love in this game, the art style is like a comic book. Even the shadows have stylized edging that you would see on comics which impressed me.\n\nAlso there are some genuinely scary moments that surprise you, you wont see them coming trust me lol.\n\nSo to finish this review, I think this game is amazing especially on the Quest but I think it needs some more optimization first to be a must buy for everyone that loves horror games, especially if your bothered by poor optimization like me. I am trudging though it because I do really dig it. If you dont care about drops in frames for a mostly smooth experience give it a buy, youll get your moneys worth in content.\n\nIf these problems are addressed then yeah pick it up definitely if you like RE, or Silent Hill.\n\nIf a future update fixes the performance drops I would give this  and give my full recommendation.\n\nHelpful | 1", "zombieruckspinApr 5 at 9:19 PM\nDUDE...\n\nThis game is great.

This game can last anywhere between 6 and 10 hours for a single run through the story).\n\n**Graphics**\nGame is gorgeous, textures look hand painted with a huge attention to details, enemies are original, levels are gorgeous. I haven't seen any visual issue playing this game. The color palette makes the game even creepier.\n\n**Sound**\nMusic is very tense and well designed. The game audio is very great and some of the best ambiance I've got to experience in VR.\n\n**Gameplay**\nFaced some bugs. The two major being crouching seems to make the game think you're sitting so it put you back normal height and when you stand up you're a giant for a few seconds. And the other bug is that the game is way too sensible and often think you're going in an object and will make screen goes black and push you back. It can be quite frustrating but it is bugs that I expect to be fixed pretty quick. For a launch day, this is nothing! And it doesn't break the game at all. I am having the most fun I ever had and each time I play it I get out only when oculus is telling me I need to (low battery). Weapons are fun - both close and distant combat - and the game runs very smooth.\n\nBuy it. It worth every penny.\n\nHelpful | 4", "luka83Apr 16 at 7:56 AM\nSmooth gameplay and nice story\n\nOne of my favourite games on quest so far. I feard that the strip like graphics will be a problem, but it ends up great and smooth on rather weak oculus quest hardware. I wish they had speech instead of just boxes with text, but it falls nicely into the whole strip like atmosphere. So far I never felt the need to check out a walkthrough and this is a giant plus. And yes you will die.

Highly recommend if you like horror and action games.\n\nHelpful | 4", "0neEyedSnakeApr 1 at 12:39 AM\nPolished and Tense\n\nI had been eagerly waiting for this game with high expectations after enjoying Robo Recall. This game didn't disappoint. It feels a lot like Resident Evil where you are guided through a carefully crafted story and have to be careful with your ammo which raises the tension, as opposed to games like Arizona Sunshine where ammo is very plentiful. The game looks very polished for the Quest and the mechanics work well. I am still early in the story and there have already been some slightly challenging moments (not playing on easy of course), though nothing overly frustrating. There is a slight issue where the screen blacks out for a second every 5 min or so (not too often) if you turn your head too fast without using the turn control, but I imagine that will get fixed very soon. Overall it is a very solid presentation with action, story, and jump scares. If anyone is wondering, it is very different from Arizona Sunshine or other zombie games. I would definitely recommend Lies Beneath for anyone interested in hacking monsters in the head with an axe or using your lighter as a red dot/aim assist for your revolver (what?!?).\n\nHelpful | 4", "EatGazellesApr 30 at 3:22 PM\nI feel like a comic book character\n\nI havent had the quest for a long time but I have already tried out many games. I have a hard time when a game doesnt bring the world to life due to limitations on the headsets performance. This game however is perfect. The comic book textures are rendered beautifully and Im fully immersed in the comic book story. The game keeps me on edge,but Im scared and yet oddly empowered to fight back. I have a curiosity to keep going, like all the main characters in horror flicks when you keep yelling at them to turn back.

Waste of money\n\nHelpful | 3", "COOPERDUDESApr 4 at 7:30 AM\nPlease buy it\n\nLies Beneath is a single player, comic book styled game with interesting and good graphics, and gameplay that will keep you hooked.\n\nTHIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nLies Beneath is a combat based game, with a touch of spookiness. I want to start by saying this is certainly not a horror game, but does have creepy vibes. So you begin with an awesome looking tutorial, and instantly after you get straight into the action.\n\nYou are in some town in alaska where the protagonist grew up, and stuff gets weird quickly. You find yourself in a dark cave, using your trusty lighter to try find your dad. And then stuff goes from 0 to 100 real quick. And then goes back down again.\n\nThe spoopy stuff is good - it can be intense, but in short moments. I also want to point out, I am not talking about jumpscares, just sudden build ups of atmosphere. After a while you find your first weapon, but are always reminded that you won't just be able to storm through the game with what you've got - you'll need to be on your toes. It becomss clear that their is something stronger than the average run of the mill zombie. Something has been stalking you, since the very beginning.\n\nBut you feel prepared. When the moment comes, you feel like a god compared to how you ran away from this 'thing' at the start of the game. After probably some tries, you find their weaknesses and exploit them - this beast has been defeated! However, things take a dark turn - your still not safe in this place. Its not over yet.\n\nCOMBAT AND MECHANICS\n\nIn the tutorial, you learn that your lighter has a variety of uses. You can not only burn evil dolls, but it is used to activate checkpoints as well as telling you where to go.\n\nYou can see much damage you've taken from blood on your hands, and as you eat food, this blood goes away in a extremely satisfying effect.\n\nYou have a range of melee and long range weapons, which have their own advantages and disadvantages. The way you can combo attacks together is brilliant - throw your axe into a zombies head, shoot them with a revolver and proceed to pull your axe out of them and bash them on the head with it. It is rewarding for trying creative things - you often have very little ammo so using a gas tank and a bullet to kill enemies instead of using 6 on one saves you resources and time.\n\nAll melee weapons can be thrown, and actually stick into enemies, like boneworks or walking dead:saints and sinners which makes it feel much more realistic.\n\nYou start with two weapon/food slots and a lighter, then later on gain an extra two weapon slots on your back.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThis game is beautiful, and really shows what the quest can do. Enemies have interesting designs and the environments/locations fit the theme of the game perfectly, other than one or two bad textured walls. I'm surprised it runs as well as it does!\n\nVERDICT (No, I'm not from IGN.)\n\nThis is certainly my favourite game on quest, has a decently long story (6-7 hrs) as well as a range of difficulty modes, and even multiple endings! It does what it does brilliantly, and has interesting, different style of graphics that I haven't seen on quest before. The combat is fun and rewarding for pulling off creative combos. Therefore, I would give this game a 9.6, and certainly my favourite quest game atm.\n\nHelpful | 3", "Gravzer333Apr 26 at 4:51 AM\nI was sceptical but this is incredible!\n\nSo with VR games Im always hesitant to buy anything because most feel like mini games.

When you pause the game sometimes you cant see the menu and it fades in and out when you move your head. Idk if its because Im not center with my boundary or a bug. But great otherwise!\n\nHelpful | 0", "andersonkodiApr 18 at 2:07 PM\nA must have!\n\nBeen quite disappointed with Quest games since I've been playing with VR Headsets for a good 7 years and they all look the same to me, but this game is easily one of the best in this platform. It's tense, it's scary but not that off putting scary, immersive and engaging. Sometimes the scenarios look alike and a bit repetitive but overall, it's pretty good. Money well spent.\n\nHelpful | 1", "VilrosApr 4 at 4:07 PM\nConsole Seller\n\nThis game is a must, I was skeptical at first because Im not a horror fan but its really a thriller shooter.

The Scares are just good enough to keep you on your toes but not so bad that a person that wasn't into scares and horror wouldn't be able to handle it. The shooting is pretty good but after playing Gun Club shooting is never quite as good in any game is it. The melee weapon(s?) are fun but don't always hit the first time and I don't feel like I am getting the full impact n every swing of the ax. This game is well worth the full price admission and I could see me going through it again on a harder level once I am done. It is creepy enough to keep all horror fans interested. I can't wait to see what lies ahead, er I mean beneath\n\nHelpful | 0", "i_am._.braydenApr 21 at 5:59 PM\nI hate the pig monsters\n\nThis game is honestly really scary, and also really good!

A must have.\n\nAt the time of writing there's still a few bugs though (even after updating). The bug where you're super tall when you come out of pause is still there sometimes. And I've encountered issues with shooting enemies that are super close to me. My gun like goes through their head and comes out the other-side. Other times the physics from them sometimes pushes my gun up into my body and I can't get a clear shot. Maybe that's on purpose come to think of it.\n\nThe game has only been out a few days so these sorts of things are to be expected, and the devs are actively updating (they've been posting change logs on the Oculus subreddit. Although I've still experienced bugs they claim to have fixed. So either the latest update hasn't reached me yet or they didn't fix them fully.\n\nBugs aside, honestly blown away by this game so far (Im about 1/4 through). They've gotten a lot of power out of the Quest and they've created a world that, whilst nothing new in the horror genre, is done well. The controls are solid in most circumstances but get a little bit frustrating under pressure. Or maybe the human in this experience is the issue...\n\nThis is a developer to watch.\n\nHelpful | 1\nDeveloper ResponseApr 3 at 10:47 AM\n\nGreetings ioloswaggins!
